        "description": "This course introduces students to the major developments and changes in China since 1949 from a multidisciplinary social science perspective. It reviews the transformative and developmental strategies in the spheres of politics, economics, society and external relations during that historical epoch. It critically examines change and continuity over three periods, namely 1949-1977 or the Mao years, 1978-1989, the earlier reform and open-up years, and 1989-present, the post-Tiananmen years.",

Then the topics will mainly turn to the economics, politics and society of contemporary China. Thought most content are not deep enough, from my point of view, this is course is quite a good choice for those without common sense about China. This course will give you a basic outline of contemporary China. If you want deeper insight, you'd better take more courses or do more reading.",

Another is native speaker but received her PhD at Tsinghua University, so she can also speak Mandarin.",

Many mainland students with strong knowledge about China will also take this course. So, take care.",

Although it's pretty hard to concentrate for 2 hours, I suggest you better do so since it's almost the only &quot;workload&quot;.",

Better don’t reg this course if you are not extraordinary good on Chinese history/current communist party systems and politics. Little bit over the mean in overall score could only get a B-, however if you got few more MCs correct than the others (Midterm: 25 in total; Final 40), then you may get A-range. Sometimes about luck since 2-3 exam questions could never rely on PPT or lecture videos. Overall mean score should be around 80-85% for this semester. But be aware, given the difference in marks proportion between 2 exams, one MC mark of mid-term is greater then that of Final exam, and also, final exam would be extremely competitive as everyone realised how small the SD was, which means, be careful in dealing with your mid-term exam!",

Also, you need to ask academic questions for 3 times, either in lectures or tutorials (6 in total) which is easier to do so, to obtain full 5 participation marks (1.5+1.5+2%). And also there would be a mid-term (35%) and a final exam (50%). Lecture videos would be released before each exam, and the content is not cumulative, meaning the content of 2 exams are separated and not repeated (One for political and one for Economic+cultural).",

            "comment_content": "The course is mainly focused on the reformation policies of China during the 80-90s.

I recommend reading the papers (especially those authored by the lecturer) as those are more likely to appear in the exams.",

He seems to be enthusiastic about what he is talking about - partly because most of the lecture contents fall within his field of research.

Another problem is that his lectures overrun a lot - sometimes by 20 min or more.<br /><br />This may seem obvious but expect a lot of unfamiliar Chinese / CCP phrases and slogans in the lecture notes.<br /><br />TAs are quite helpful and give hints on how to prepare for the exams.",
