        "description": "Experiential Learning is one of the pillars of Tri-modal Education; its aim is to broaden the professional interests and exposure of students by enhancing their practicum/team-based experience through initiatives different from those of traditional lectures and tutorials. This course will provide an experiential approach to aviation through 1) a series of guest lectures delivered by aerospace professionals; 2) student-initiated video-making sessions on aerospace-related topics; and 3) active participation in an international aerospace competition. The goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via experiential learning. The course will initially be led by faculty and then self-directed by students with faculty retreating as coaches or advisors.  Students must obtain prior approval from course coordinator for enrolling in the course.",
