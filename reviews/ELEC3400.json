            "comment_content": "Start with some introduction to ic design industry like how much money the industry makes and how big the market is, etc.<br /><br />Then the technical part starts.<br />Taught:<br />Diodes, BJT transistor, MOSFET transistor<br />Small signal analysis<br />BJT and mosfet single stage amplifier<br />2,3-stage amplifier<br />BJT and mosfet differential amplifier<br /><br />No time to teach:<br />variable gain amplifier<br />current source made of transistor<br />active load amplifier<br />amplifier technology summary<br /><br />Being good at basic circuit analysis techniques like KCL and KVL is a must in this course. Otherwise you surely can understand nothing. Knowing how to do diode questions in elec2400 also helps you in chapter 1. Knowing op amps can help you understand differential amplifier in later chapters.<br /><br />An optional requirement is knowing Linux because you will need to use Hspice which is a circuit simulation software in their linux remote terminal. You can ask the professor if you want to use other simulation softwares.<br /><br />It is not guaranteed to get good grade in 3400 even if you did good in elec 2400. The concepts in elec 2400 is a must in this course but not sufficient. There are much more new concepts in this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is ok.<br />Howard always reminds us the administrative stuff at the start of lectures. He also repeats the things he taught last lecture to help us to revise. The pace is therefore quite slow. But you don't want him to be fast because there are a lot of formulas and equations that can confuse you if he teaches quickly.",
            "comment_grading": "Very good but not transparent.<br />5 HW 10%, only 4 of them are counted. I got 9.525%<br />Class participation 5%, not released<br />3 Lab 20% (prelab 30%, lab performance 20%, report 50%), I got 19.12%<br />Midterm 25%, I got 25%<br />Final project 40%, not released.<br /><br />So I at least got 53.645% excluding the unreleased grades and got A+.<br /><br />I don't know how much I got from the final project. But I guess that the marking of project is very lenient because I only spent one day(deadline) to seriously design that. And it doesn't fit all the requirements.<br /><br />I am also not sure how he counts the attendance.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is quite heavy.<br /><br />Each hw has only 1-3 questions. But each question has quite a lot of tasks including the hand calculation and circuit simulation which requires you to model the circuit in Hspice and compare the result with your hand calculation.<br /><br />Lab needs prelab, but prelab questions are easy. Lab are held online. You watch the TA plugging in things and answer his questions when he asks. You need to take screenshot of the result then put it in your report. Finally you need to finish the lab report which the professor has a style guide for you to follow.<br /><br />Mid-term is a take-home exam. he gave us 3 days to do. It is like hw but more complicated.<br /><br />Workload is relatively high near the end of semester because we have a group project in this semester. <br /><br />Final group project asks you to design a two-input single output differential amplifier using NMOS given some limitation like the power usage, total resistance used, output gain, etc. We are not given any templates. You need to build it from nothing.<br />1-3 students per group are expected.",

In the end, this course only tests calculation instead of designing. <br /><br />JUST REMEMBER:<br /><br />1. ANY complicated circuit can be simplified into different blocks of single-stage amplifier. <br />2. The single-stage amplifier is one of the CE, CB, CC; CS, CD, CG topology. <br />3. ANY block can be simplified into a resistor (Rib, Ric, Rie; Ris, Rid, Rig). <br />4. Differential amplifiers transform two inputs into a single output, the rest is just going over 1, 2 and 3. <br />5. Current mirror is one of the current sources, it can be simplified into a resistor in AC analysis.<br /><br />AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.

            "comment_teaching": "In the beginning, the teaching was pretty good. <br /><br />However, we lost 3 classes because of public holidays and the professor realized that he couldn't finish the materials, and he rushed through the end from differential amplifiers and so on.

The lab reports are quite time-consuming as well. I spent the most of the time learning this course this semester. <br /><br />The funny thing is quite a few people rely on the sources from previous years. I could tell because in the last assignment this year, although the questions are more or less the same as the last assignment of last year (because the title of the solution has &quot;2020 Fall&quot; in it), their was a minor change of the parameter in one of the question, but the answer is the same as last year's. I noticed this and emailed the TA to get my points back. Just then I realized that someone still got full marks before I emailed the TA, they must have used the answers from last year directly LOL. No wonder the mean of the assignments are high. <br /><br />I do not see any point of doing this (copying directly from source), because you would still fuck up your final if you have totally no idea about the mechanisms. This is no longer 2020 where you cheaters can just cheat without having to put up with the consequences.",
