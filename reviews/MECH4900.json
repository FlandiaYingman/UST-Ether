            "comment_content": "This is the 1-year FYDP course for MECH students. Before doing the FYDP, you can either choose joining the co-op program to gain practical experience in industry, or do the FYDP if you are keen on research.&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of topics will be released by the department in May for you to choose. You need to form a group of 3 or 4 and choose the topics. The result of the topic selection will be released around July for my year. Self-proposed topics are also acceptable if there are faculty doing similar research topics.<br /><br />For my group, our topic is to design a flexible flat heat pipe, with Prof. HUANG as our supervisor. The actual content depends on the targets you want to achieve for your project. For our group, we design, fabricate and test our device. Usually a real device is required as it is one of the FYDP requirements.<br /><br />A 10000 words progress report is required at the end of November, then a progress presentation is arranged in early December, during the study break. At the end of the Spring semester, a final report is required, with a 2000 words Group section and 5000 words individual section from each of the groupmates. At first it seems horrible, but you may exceed the word limit easily if you have a lot of achievements. Samples for the reports will be provided.",
            "comment_teaching": "There is no real teaching for our project. We need to self-learn a lot of stuff, like the operation principle of heat pipe, operation of the apparatus for our experiments. Prof. HUANG do not have very strict requirement on our meetings. We see him most often in the Fall semester, almost every two weeks, but we only met him in the Spring semester for 3 times only. For my group, as my groupmates are my friends, it is easy to discuss the project. Prof. HUANG, as our supervisor, is willing to help us if we have any trouble in the project, and his suggestions are sometimes feasible.<br /><br />However, the PhD student of Prof. HUANG is a bit terrible. Although he seems to try his best to help you in the lab, the arrival of some equipment always delay a bit. This affect our progress, especially for the experiment. He is not very active in answering our questions.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading depends on the panel for the assessment and the supervisor. Our group got A- at the end, and I think the grade is quite good already as our reports and presentations are not very good. No need to be afraid in the Q&amp;A session as professors expected you cannot answer his/her questions. Just try your best. Our group cannot answer most of the questions, but still get this grade.<br /><br />As the grade partly depends on the supervisor, choosing a good professor is important. Baoling may be your choice if you want to work on topics related to energy and want a good grade.<br /><br />P.S.: If you see the name Kim on the supervisor's name, plz ignore it immediately!!! If you see the name Kim on the supervisor's name, plz ignore it immediately!!! If you see the name Kim on the supervisor's name, plz ignore it immediately!!! <br />Important, so I need to say it 3 times. Never choose Kim as your supervisor. Advice from my friend who has Kim supervising his FYP.",
            "comment_workload": "It depends on you. If you want to be a freerider, of course there is no workload. But if you want to have a decent grade, better spend some time on the project every week. The workload will be the highest when it is near to the deadline for the reports and presentations.",
