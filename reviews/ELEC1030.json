        "description": "This course is designed to give students with little or no technical background a general understanding about robots and their potential impact. Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day‐to‐day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour‐based, cognitive and biologically-inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human‐machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. The learning process is designed to transcend conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and will be facilitated by a series of demonstrative sessions presenting students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions enabled by robotic and automation technology. In this exploration process, students will be encouraged to apply their personal background and interests, and possibly experiment with robot kits.",

            "comment_content": "教嘅都係上網好易揾嘅野，比如佢會教點為之robot，一架autonomous car要咩主要零件，雷達有邊幾種，一般有咩分別果啲。Prof好清楚話呢個係CC，所以內容只能夠係簡單，唔會深入講。我諗如果本身讀ENG可能會覺得冇學過野。我本身近乎完全冇Robot/Autonomous car嘅知識，所以聽落尚算有趣。<br /><br />想學嘢唔好讀佢，想輕鬆fulfill cc requirement就啱晒啦。",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof講嘢唔快，唔會聽唔明，但內容就比較亂，佢有時會講講下一樣又跳去講第二啲野。不過有問題嘅話佢都會答嘅。<br />另外有tutorial嘅，但個TA就唔係咁掂，有啲有問題都會問起佢，不過佢都好坦白話自己其實唔係專讀呢個course 嘅野所以都唔係好識lol 所以我感覺tutorial學嘅野係淺上加淺，自己睇都得唔洗上。<br />另外我覺得online上課應該對course都影響幾大，因為本身每課tutorial都應該係去lab搞robot果啲，網課就完全做唔到呢件事啦，讀完都未新眼見到科大個robot。",
            "comment_grading": "Parti佔10%，佢話如果成日都唔上會唔俾人考試，所以其實走唔得幾多堂。個人感覺都唔爛，成個course主要都係四份asg，一個pj，一個mid term exam。 考試同asg都十分簡單，高分唔難，我見mean都高，大家都高分。問題就係最後分組嘅pj，有其他人一齊做好麻煩，果陣我pj最後below mean，不過最後都a range，所以唔差。<br /><br />問題係，呢個course岀貓太簡單了，我考完剩返好多時間就望下其他人嘅畫面，hello有人好明顯好明顯睇緊notes揾答案喎，冇人理lmao。唔好希望呢個course嘅exam揾到fair competition。",
            "comment_workload": "ASG唔算多，全個sem有4份，都係短嘅report。不過就覺得有啲多餘，除左第一份係要自己揾robot寫之外，另外嘅都係佢會俾資料你，你揾返啱嘅內容抄返落去就得，以為抄會低分咩？又唔係喎5分滿分都4.8或者4.9，已經above mean，佢真係冇想你思考，少多餘。Pj都比足夠時間做，完全唔chur，我會覺得係懶人救命course。",
