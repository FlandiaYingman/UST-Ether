        "description": "This study involves engaging the ANSYS CFD software to simulate the transport and fate of PM2.5 and bioaerosols in a clinic setting. Field measurements will be performed on site to validate the model. Necessary corrections will be made in the model to achieve an accurate simulation of the dispersion behavior of PM2.5 and microorganisms in the subject setting. Students should seek instructor's approval to take this course.",
