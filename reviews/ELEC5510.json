            "comment_content": "This course provides basic knowledge about switch mode power converter. It puts a focus on the control theory in the converter design. <br /><br />Personally, I think this course is more like introducing the control theory on the background of electronic circuit. It can be quite useful if one is a new guy in the electronic engineering.",

            "comment_grading": "The grading is good. There are midterm and final, but the questions are mostly variants of the homework questions, and one can get through them easily if he/she finishes the homework with enough thoughts. The amount of questions in the exams may be a little bit high and one can not finish all of them, but the professor will curve the grade.",
            "comment_workload": "There are 5~6 assignments. There are intensive calculations and light logical deductions. Finishing each of them may take 1 day time. If you enjoy the calculation, this is fine. But if you find calculation very tedious, it can be quite a nightmare.",
