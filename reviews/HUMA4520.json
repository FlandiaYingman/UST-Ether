            "comment_content": "The content is about the US-China relation from Qing dynasty to the PRC. The course mainly focus in the 40s-50s. There are lots of reading materials, including the textbook and readings. <br /><br />The mid-term exam and the final exam are mostly related to the textbook. The textbook is quite interesting but the it’s a bit long. So reading the textbook after every class would be easier to manage with the exam.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Chang’s teaching was pretty good. He would have discussion on the current US-China issues with the students every class to show the patterns of the US-China relations. <br /><br />He did prepare ppt for the class, but I think the ppt is not enough to deal with the exam.",
            "comment_grading": "Good.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was pretty heavy. In one semester, Prof required two exams, pop up quizes, final essay and timeline. <br /><br />In the two exams, students need to have a take home exam. Citing the textbook would get higher marks in the essay so it would be IMPORTANT to read the textbook and readings after every class!",
