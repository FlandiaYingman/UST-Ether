        "description": "This course focuses on how real estate financing is undertaken and the key considerations for the borrower and the lender. This is achieved through a master case study which runs through the duration of the course and evolves as different aspects of real estate financing are discussed. The course will focus on the key steps in a transaction life-cycle and require participants to prepare basic cash-flow models, approval memos and negotiate term-sheets. The course also includes additional case studies around hedging and considerations around cross border real estate financings.",
