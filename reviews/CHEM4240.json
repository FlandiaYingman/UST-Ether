            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Leung:<br />His teaching style is similar to CHEM3220. Just that the contents are much harder. There are still inclass questions, tutorial (inclass), problem sets for Prof. Leung's part. His talking speed is still fast and its hard for students like me (below mean teen) to catch up. The ppt slides are good, you can study those slides and catch up.<br /><br />Prof. Quan:<br />Prof. Quan is a new faculty member who is interested in photochemistry. This part is new and not included in previous semesters, this is also his 2nd teaching semester, so he has not master how to teach. He teaching style is similar to another Inorg faculty member (1030/5310), many figures, using journal paper as examples. But then the thing is I cannot understand his explanations of the journal papers. Its great that these contents are not included in quiz and there ain't final exam for this course. But the photochemistry contents are the scope for your presentation and report. <br /><br />No problem set for Prof. Quan's part, there is a tutorial session for Q&amp;A but no extra questions. He will do a few inclass exercise with us at the end of each lecture, and these questions will appear in your assignment and quiz 3, so do listen to what he says.",
            "comment_grading": "• Quiz 1 &amp; 2: 2x4%<br />• Quiz 3: 5%<br />• Assignments: 2x5%<br />• Mid-term exam: 37%<br />• Presentation and written report: ~30+10%<br /><br />Quiz 1 &amp;2 by Prof.Leung, both consist of 10 MC<br />Quiz 3 by Prof.Quan, consist of 20 MC.<br />Quizzes are inclass, held at the last half of the lecture. Qs in the quiz are not hard, therefore mean is very high. <br /><br />Even with Prof.Quan's quiz, those photochemistry contents were for your presentation, not quiz, so the questions are acceptable. Some qs are from his inclass exercises. Contents from journal paper are excluded from quiz (which he only mentioned in on the day of quiz lol)<br /><br />Midterm is VERY hard. Most of the qs are new and never seen before. Consist of 10xMC, T/F, short qs. <br /><br />Presentation in groups of 2 (self arranged). Topic of presentation need to be emailed to Prof. Quan one day in advance. 13mins+ 2mins Q&amp;A. <br /><br />Prof.Quan will definitely have qs for you as he is VERY familiar with his own field. Its okay if you cant answer his qs but do make it guess. He will answer the qs later himself which is a good source for &quot;Own insight&quot; in your 5 pages report.<br /><br />Midterm and presentation are equally important. I was below mean for midterm but I guess I did well for presentation+report (no marks were given back) and scored B range.",
            "comment_workload": "I actually give up on GPA since its my final year. I used the least amount of time (1 day revision) for quizzes and therefore are mostly below/right on mean. <br /><br />Midterm is very hard, if you want a good grade, you need to study more than the lecture notes provided since there will be a huge portions of qs which are new (not seen in lecture/problem set)<br /><br />Prof.Quan is responsible for presentation so the topics are on photochemistry. He will teach those topics and let you know those are suitable for presentation. There will also be a list of topics which he thinks are suitable (in ppt slides, not separately uploaded onto Canvas), u can just choose from this list. The workload for this part is huge since the schedule for presentation was upload in early nov, and the first group presents on 20/11.",
