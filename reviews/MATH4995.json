Familiarity with a programming language is preferred, such as R, Matlab, or Python. For BSc in Data Science and Technology students only.",

            "comment_content": "The content of the course was completely different form previous years since the instructor had changed. Prof Ye used 3 weeks to introduce SVD and sparsity. The remaining weeks are mandatory progress presentations(3 in total).<br />Most of the reference papers were contributed by her husband Prof Cai. Quite understandable, how else could she condemned our mediocrity up her ivory tower with source codes and shit. <br />Tips: contact other contributors of your reference paper, they might have the original source codes and other related researches that might inspire you.",
            "comment_teaching": "These's not much teaching in the course. According to prof Ye, topics like SVD, sparsity and optimization were mentioned in MATH 3332. She did elaborate on those topics, but her notes and accents provided little help understanding the content. She might skim through contents we have no knowledge of since she's unfamiliar of our course pathways.<br />The TA is real nice tho, he would take the time to help you understand your mission and provide solutions to your inquiries.",
            "comment_grading": "Can't be that bad in a capstone project, at worst you get a B.<br />Final exam was opennotes, so bring you printed course notes to the exam. Most of the solutions could be found in those notes.",
            "comment_workload": "The course involves coding, a report, presentation and a final exam. I knew the course would be a cluster-fuck first lesson in when I realized the content of the course has completely changed. What's worse was when she announced there would be a final exam. If you are familiar with python codes and independent research, it should be a piece of cake course to you. Just remember to save some content for every next progress presentation, or else she would accused of providing nothing new.",
