Finally, voting systems and bargain game are also included.<br /><br />Overall, the vast majority of the course is about optimization problems in real life using mathematical techniques, most notably multivariable calculus. You will find this course to be interesting if you like mathematical modelling.<br /><br />Even though the course lists MATH2121 (or similar) as its prerequisites, the application of linear algebra here is minimal.",

Some of them requires you to reproduce the proof discussed in class.
