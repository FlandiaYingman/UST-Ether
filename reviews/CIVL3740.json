            "comment_content": "For the content part, please refer to others comment. It is basically the continuation of 3730. I would like to discuss the appropriacy of the content. In terms of course content, this is a perfect illustration of how well is the course design for the B.Eng. of Asia MIT is. (and sadly you cannot skip it unless you can apply credit transfer)<br /><br />Most of the civil UG curriculum (in HKU and also research-based universities) will only have the following core courses: engineering geology(CIVL4700, which Asia MIT has omitted in its core), and soil mechanics. Geotechnical design/ foundation engineering are usually provided as electives.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to follow if a student is not familiar with the basic contents such as pressure diagram, consolidation model and seepage. An attempt to grasp every of the course or else you will go crazy unless you are a genius. The only reason why this course is not ceased to exist is that it covers slope stability, as required by the HKIE. Even though this course has trimmed to suit the expectation for a Year 3/4 student. The course has turned out in a disorganized manner, with the lapping of many theories behind it. Moreover, there are even no grounds for CIEV students taking this course.<br /><br />TLDR;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just stick to the lecture notes and get familiar with the questions so that you can survive with the course. Don't expect you will learn much after course completion, even it is content-rich in the first glance.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ni is a new professor, after the revision of the course notes last year the notes contain fewer errors and more reader friendly. His notes are clear enough so that you can read the steps thoroughly and understand what is going on, even though the contents are troublesome.<br /><br />Albeit his teaching is unattractive, he can point out the key points on solving the problem. Once you are in the lecture, you can realize that he is going to instil something new to you, rather than merely showing off their competency in a specific discipline.",
            "comment_grading": "Quite good, mean grades will turn out a B this year.

The problem arising from pore water distribution between both sides of the wall and soil arching are also covered.<br />3 - Design of temporary support for excavation. Important topics include braced-cut, heaving of clay as well as soil swelling.<br />4 - Shallow foundation design. The factor of safety is the key for this chapter. The calculation part mainly depends on reading the values from graph.<br />5 - Deep foundation design. The pile driven into sand, clay and rock will be discussed. Bearing capacity and shearing resistance will be important.<br />6 - Slope stability. Again, factor of safety is the key for this chapter.

            "comment_content": "CIVL3740 係3730 Soil Mechanics 課程延續 基本上3730 最重要的概念例如 Effective Stress, Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, 2D Seepage 計Flownet, 1D Consolidation 計Settlement 係呢個Course 係貫徹始終 所以務必記得讀熟<br /><br />3740 重點放係Analysis of geotechnical related structures and applications<br />e.g. retaining wall, cantilever wall, braced cut excavation &amp; lateral support (ELS), shallow foundations, deep foundations and soil slope <br /><br />主要有六課 頭三課Midterm 尾三課Final 詳情如下<br />1. Lateral Earth Pressure <br />第一課係之後兩課基礎 呢課概念爲主 透過利用泥本身 Vertical Effective Stress Distribution 考慮Soil tendency to move in which side 去揾三款 Earth Pressure Distribution (at rest, passive and active pressure) 當中有Jaky Equation, Rankine theory and Coulomb theory<br />Assumption 同Proof 務必熟讀 <br /><br />2. Retaining wall <br />Gravity wall, cantilever wall <br />基本上Gravity Wall 係呢科用第一課内容做 Analysis 爲主 揾不同FOS (due to overturning, sliding, bearing capacity) <br />Cantilever Wall 揾Vertical Effective stress and earth pressure distribution on active and passive side 去定斷embedment depth 要幾深 <br />計數部分Step 複雜最好做題練習<br />概念部分只有Soil arching <br /><br />3. Braced Cut Lateral Support System <br />呢課玩Excavation 橫撐支撐 係不同Pressure Envelope 底下每條Strut take幾多load 同moment <br />概念野講如何計算FOS of the excavation under changing water level, soil liquefaction, soil stiffness &amp; dilatancy 之類<br /><br />4. Shallow foundation <br />又係 Analysis 爲主講不同footing 種類係兩種bearing capacity theory (鼎鼎大名Terzaghi &amp; Mayerhof equation) 係general shear failure 底下揾ultimate bearing capacity 有不同assumption 同consideration (under semi-empirical approach) 水位變化對bearing capacity 的影響 同埋FOS, effective area method <br />代數計算爲主 (contributions from cohesion, vertical stress, unit weight 揾bearing capacity factor with given friction angle, as well as to find other semi empirical factors) <br /><br />後面個部分就講vertical stress increase under different load type 係不同深度同情況下的變化 有好多不同Theory同Method 計算<br />之後係為左計Settlement of shallow foundation of soil (elastic, primary and secondary settlement under drained and undrained conditions) <br /><br />5. Deep Foundation (pile foundation)<br />呢課有不同Assumptions &amp; approach (total stress/effective stress) 去揾Pile 的toe resistance and shaft resistance under sand/clay/rock <br />好多都係一堆Experimental 例如透過做field test 揾SPT N60 value 同empirical Approach 代數字去揾兩種resistance 而去揾total ultimate resistance of the pile <br />同埋Pile Group under single pile or block failure mode 揾Ultimate resistance 分別<br />呢科suppose 會講多D settlement 計算影響同埋其他不同Pile (driven pile/ H-socket pile)不過又係無講 （HKU有講）<br />概念野 Negative Skin Friction 同Pile Load Test 同其他proposed empirical method to identify ultimate load and settlement<br /><br />6. Stability of soil slope <br />呢課講得好brief&nbsp;&nbsp;CIVL4710 會有更仔細論述同埋會用到Slope/W&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />呢課其實最重要 香港山多平地少 山泥傾瀉頻繁 Soil Slope 的穩定性好重要 唔係會死人（每次都係講 Po Shan Road Landslide 聼到悶) 同埋全世界好多做slope engineering 同mitigation works<br /><br />呢課主要講不同sliding mechanism 同assumption 去揾FOS　Proof同唔同Assumption係最重要内容 水位改變對FOS改變要識(precipitation, Infiltration, runoff 呢D野又無講) 點樣做slope upgrade 點樣搞泥釘做rigid barrier flexible barrier 呢堆common upgrading works 技術又無教 <br /><br />結論：内容本身吾太悶 不過無深度無太多現實考量 建議自修 吾係就一舊雨暈<br />想學更多自己睇書讀Code 或者4000 5000 Elective 見",
