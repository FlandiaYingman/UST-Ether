        "description": "Since the June Fourth Movement in 1989, underground/independent cinema has emerged as an alternative film culture in contemporary China. Distanced from the state-controlled film industry and often regarded as a counter culture against mainstream ideologies, independent cinema is frequently banned in China and screened abroad at international film festivals. As a symbol of both media democracy and secrecy, it provides us with a unique window to understand the diversified culture and society full of clamorous voices in post-1989 China. This course explores the histories, aesthetics, styles, contents, techniques, and technologies of independent cinema in contemporary China. It will be students-oriented and conducted through forms of seminars and discussions. Unlike traditional courses that are based on uni-directional lectures, readings, exams, and papers in a fixed classroom, this experimental course encourages students to venture outside and engage more with our society. It is a non-conventional, open, and democratic course that puts students in direct contact with our rapidly changing world.",

            "comment_workload": "Hmm I would say not much? <br /><br />You need to watch 1 to 3 films per week in order to sufficiently discuss the topics during class.<br /><br />The film making could be time-consuming, but interesting at the same time. If you choose to write a paper, make sure you are aiming at the right direction (talk to the TA as often as possible)",
