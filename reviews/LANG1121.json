        "description": "This course builds on the groundwork laid in LANG 1120, and takes students to a higher level of understanding of Putonghua phonology and a stronger communicative competence in using Chinese in daily and social situations. The course is restricted to students with non‐Chinese language backgrounds. Instructors’ approval is required for students with Chinese backgrounds who are from international schools of Hong Kong, China Mainland and other Asian countries, also for overseas students with either Mandarin or Cantonese language backgrounds. For students without prerequisite but with prior Chinese learning experience of approximately 50 hours may seek instructors’ approval to enroll in the course.",

There is a big discrepancy between the contents she taught and the difficulty of the exam. You gotta take this course if your Chinese level is high enough and just faking to take lower level class. Don't take this course if you are not confident enough with your Chinese. Just take LANG 1120. This is for the beginners and it will better suit you.",
