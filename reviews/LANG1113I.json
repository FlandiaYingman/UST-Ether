            "comment_content": "The content is largely similar to LANG1113. It includes stuff that explains how chinese writing is structured, how to formulate the introduction, conclusion, etc. There was a unit on HKUST, a unit on analytical report writing, and a unit on understanding society. If any of these things interest you, it will probably make this course easier to stomach. Perhaps you might be able to close your eyes and swallow it like a bitter pill. If these things don't interest you, bury your face in your hands and ask yourself why you chose HKUST as your university AND barely qualify as a person that knows chinese.",
            "comment_teaching": "Of all the aspects of LANG1113I, this is the thing I like the most. The pace of learning is actually quite reasonable, and there were a couple of friendly teaching assistants that made the class fun (or as fun as it's going to get for such a GREAT course). If you know simplified chinese, this part is going to be pretty good, as all the powerpoint slides are in simplified. If you are one of those people that only know traditional chinese characters, well, good luck.",
            "comment_grading": "A good thing about LANG1113I is that apparently the grading of the course is not grouped with the regular LANG1113 course. However, this does not mean the course is going to be a free A. In fact, the grade is probably going to be quite painful, especially if you are a high-achiever in other subjects. Don't expect a good grade without any work. You're taking this course. Don't expect a silver lining.",
            "comment_workload": "Since this course is LANG1113I, I'm assuming that your chinese writing and oral skills are not stellar. Perhaps your vocabulary is not that impressive, or your pronunciation is (quite) a bit off. The good thing is that you get the option to type essays on your computer using whatever input method you like. The bad thing is the fact that you'll need to put in quite a bit of effort to prepare for the presentations. The REALLY bad thing is that you're going to also do a group discussion that you can't really prepare for. Good luck!",
