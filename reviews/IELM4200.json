The project needs to be a real problem and the solution have to actually work. It is better to have a group mate which can access to real data about warehouse, factory, logistics facilities etc.<br />In the tutorial, it would teach some useful software about the skills learnt, such as Excel VBA and BLOCPLAN.",
