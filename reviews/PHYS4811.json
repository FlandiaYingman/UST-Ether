Good coverage of some foundational topics and highlights some of the important algorithms. <br /><br />The project asks you to code a supervised learning neural network&nbsp;&nbsp;on PyTorch using gradient descent and define a customized loss function (plus maybe some other separation functions).",

            "comment_workload": "Although it is a 1-credit course, you should treat it like a 3-credit course that lasts for a month. Weekly HWs, and the coding project can be rather demanding if you're new to neural networks. However, there is a TA that can provide some helpful instructions for the coding part. I took roughly 2 days to work on the project with almost no coding background except COMP1021. Students familiar with coding neural networks might finish it in a few hours.",
