        "description": "This course covers the concepts and practical applications of medical physics, emphasizing physics methods for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases with the specific goal of improving human health and well-being. It focuses on radiation physics, medical imaging physics and nuclear medicines. Topics include radiation physics, nuclear medicines such as radiotherapy, medical imaging including nuclear medicine imaging, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound imaging. The main goal of this course is to equip students with the physical knowledge for medical physics. Upon completion of this course, students should be able to explain the basic physics behind medical physics and to address problems related to medical physics. This course will also provide some physical insights into the issues of the medical equipment industry.",

            "comment_content": "One month-long course with ~7 lectures.<br /><br />1) Overview of Medical Physics<br />2) Medical Imaging Physics I, II<br />3) Radiation Physics<br />4) Nuclear Medicine Physics I, II<br />5) Medical Devices<br /><br />Lectures cover basic topics in each aforementioned field. They include some content that might require some prior knowledge of biology, which might be a possible drawback for PHYS students. Overall, it's a simple rudimentary introduction to important applications of physics in medicine.<br /><br />Idk why PHYS3033 was listed as a pre-requisite.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Park comes across as very caring and friendly. Although he struggled to retain class attendance lol, he still explains pretty well. More importantly, considering the main intention of providing this course (which is to introduce and promote medical physics), he shares a looot of his real-life experiences or about his colleagues. He's willing to answer any follow-up questions you may have, even ones concerning his personal experiences. He also gave us the maximum possible time to finish our reports.",
            "comment_grading": "60% HW assignment, 40% Project Report.<br /><br />I scored 56/60 for HW. The mean was 47.6. <br /><br />Report scores were not released. However, I would say that my report was quite well written and covered some recent research advances (2020 and later)<br /><br />I got an A+. <br /><br />Professor had announced in class that grading will be rather generous and more than half the students should get an A range.",
            "comment_workload": "The HW assignment consists of 11 problems. Most of them are straightforward computations using formulae from lecture slides. Some of them might require a bit more thinking. I only took a couple of hours to finish it.<br /><br />The project report is a 3-5 page report on any application of physics in the field of medicine. There is no specific rubric or template to follow. Students are free to choose whatever topic they're interested in. The only important factor here is that you demonstrate some critical thinking in your report and make it 'interesting' for Prof.<br /><br />I would suggest that you read some recent literature on topics that haven't been covered in detail in lectures. Instead of a direct review, you should build up the topic at hand logically and mix in your own comments/suggestions on the topic. You can then cite relevant papers to back up your suggestions. Prof. warned us that he wouldn't give a good score for a report that basically mimicked a review article.",
