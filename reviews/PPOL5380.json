        "description": "Rapid advances in disruptive technologies over the last two decades have significantly altered our lives. They have upended old business models, disintermediated incumbent firms in many industries, and disrupted supply chains. This module gives students a broad introduction to the key disruptive technologies that are likely to transform our economy and society in the next decade or so. We will examine the practical applications of these technologies and discuss their policy implications and socioeconomic impacts. We will also look at the potential for governments to leverage new digital technologies to deliver new services or improve existing ones and enhance public value. Above all, we will examine the implications for public policy and how government should respond.",
