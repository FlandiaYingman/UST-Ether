Also something too vague to know his grading. He gave comment on the paper, but only one or two sentences and nothing knowledgable. <br /><br />One group project,<br />with no peer evaluation. A business proposal (yes, a business proposal in a huma course, but according to him, no need to be too business with so much figure on $$$) on starting a new tea business in Hong Kong. No presentation so do not know how a &quot;Good&quot; proposal is.<br />High marks for everyone.<br />Full marks: 30<br />Mean: 26.5<br />Low: 24<br />High: 28<br /><br />One tea diary assignment,<br />on the start of the term, just a p/f assignment.

Around 3.5-4 hours in total, but you need to write notes while watching, so it is very time-consuming. I have used around 2-3 days.<br /><br />William Melrose assignment: you need to read the book first (have e-version provided). It is not a thin book (personal opinion), so again it takes you 3-4 days to finish this essay.<br /><br />Final Project: changed to essay<br />can choose YouTube channel, or social media like IG, Facebook.<br />Participation: it is shocking 20%!!!! It is very horrible for an introvert like me.<br />But since in zoom meeting, nearly no one open cam and no one speak up, I believe I am safe. Be careful if you take this course f2f, need to raise your hand and participate in class discussion.",

The tutorial is supposed to let you taste some of the tea mentioned, but because of the pandemic (online learning), you only watch the teacher &amp; the TA drink tea while observing the physical difference of the tea. Quite a lot of videos shown in lectures too.<br /><br />Reading materials at home is not required. You'll be told to read some materials in class. A lot of them are in Chinese, but the teacher understands if you can't read Chinese. He roughly translates it for you so you can understand the main point.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teacher is okay. The lecture can get boring (probably because it's online) but it's bearable. <br /><br />For the assignments, he almost never gives you a clear idea of what he wants. He wants to keep the topic broad and vague so he won't need to read similar essays.",
            "comment_grading": "The teacher grades your essay like an English teacher would. The comment I got in my first essay was &quot;Good analysis - I do wish you would be more assertive in your intro/conclusion.&quot; Overall I think he's lenient in grading your assignment.s",
            "comment_workload": "Tea diary, 2 essay and 1 group project. A lot of writing, so be prepared if you struggle in that area.<br /><br />Tea diary: Basically just write any tea-related products that you encounter in one week. Even if it's tea-infused shampoo, it counts. Easily get 10/10.<br /><br />1st essay: 5-7 pages film comparative paper. <br />You watch 2 movies about this historical figures and write a review (compare &amp; contrast). You're not required to write something related to the course, even if you compare the plot or the clothing, etc (movie aspect) it's okay. <br /><br />2nd essay: 5-7 pages book analysis. <br />Takes a bit more time since you need to read some parts of a historical document. You're required to pick a topic from the book and discuss about it, criticise &quot;whether or not it's appropriate to be a source&quot;. You can include your own views and thoughts. <br /><br />Group project: Business proposal. <br />You and your group needs to make a proposal for a tea-related product/business. You can sell tea, food, beauty products, etc. Anything as long as it contains tea. You can arrange a meeting with the teacher but he usually will answer it vaguely. One of the grading criteria is originality, but he also wants you to not go too crazy (so your &quot;business&quot; won't fail the day you start it). As long as your team works together, the project is doable. The deadline was near finals, so make sure to manage your time properly.",
