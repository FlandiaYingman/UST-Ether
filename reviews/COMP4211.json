            "comment_content": "1. Overview<br /><br />This is an introductory course on machine learning. In short, you will build models that learn useful patterns from features in dataset.<br /><br />Teaching Syllabus:<br />- Artificial neural networks (Perceptron, deep networks, CNN, RNN, GAN)<br />- K-means Clustering<br />- PCA (short)<br />- Q Learning<br /><br />TL;DR In case you don't have the time to read this 3400+ words review, just remember one thing: Don't register the course when James is teaching. <br /><br /><br />2. Coverage<br /><br />If you have taken COMP 4471, congratz! You won't be able to learn anything from the course. The course content is basically a subset of COMP 4471 with a short intro to k-means clustering and PCA.<br /><br />There are also some common stuffs in a standard ML course that is not covered.<br />- Regularization Techniques (e.g. dropout, weight decay, ...)<br />- Model Selection (e.g. bias-variance tradeoff, error metrics)<br />- Hyperparameter Tuning<br /><br />Although the content suggested by the other review may be too difficult/theoretical, it would be good to add things like deep Q network or ensembling. Introducing some of the state-of-the-art research also would make the course more interesting.<br /><br /><br />3. Content Difficulty<br /><br />The funny thing is although COMP 4471 covered more topics than this course, it covered them in more details. Even in COMP 1942, for the k-mean clustering and the PCA, it covered them step-by-step instead of going through them briefly. <br /><br />As mentioned in other comments, COMP 4211 do not feel like a 4000-level course. It would be nice to go into more details in some of the parts. For example, it is interesting to see a sketch proof of perceptron convergence theorem (which I did in COMP 4901K). <br /><br /><br />4. Usefulness<br /><br />The lectures covered basic concepts of machine learning but it is far enough from a real life machine learning project. It would only be useful if you want to take more machine learning courses in the future. But why bother registering this if you can learn everything from other courses.<br /><br />Clustering, PCA - In COMP 1942<br />Q-Learning, RL - In COMP 3211<br />Perceptron, Deep Learning - In COMP 4901K<br /><br />The machine learning research field is very active. However, there is minimal discussion on state-of-the-art techniques. Better to take COMP 4471 for that.<br /><br />If you want to learn the basics on deep learning, take the course by Andrew Ng in coursera (like everyone suggested in the Reddit). You will benefit far more than taking this course.<br /><br /><br />5. Disconnection between Lectures &amp; Assignments<br /><br />To be honest, the project would have been a good project if the instruction was clear and the techniques used were introduced in the lecture. It is a good learning experience to implement a fast R-CNN from scratch (with PyTorch). However, this is only possible given the following:<br />- I took the coursera Deep Learning and Tensorflow in practice specialization beforehand.<br />- I had some (but not a lot) experience tuning hyperparamenters from the COMP 4901K project.<br />- I got a decent computer at home (i5-4460+GTX960, not too powerful but suffice).<br /><br />The lecture does not cover any of the following:<br />- hyperparameter tuning (how to tune? what to tune? techniques?)<br />- debugging deep models (gradient checking? try a small dataset? visualization?)<br />- potential issues and their solution (vanishing/exploding gradient, dying ReLU) <br />- dealing with large datasets (how to scale up? baselines?)<br /><br />How are we suppose to complete the project without learning anything above? Also, it would be much better if some object detection concepts (e.g. object proposal) are covered in the lecture. <br /><br />P.S. I was taking COMP 3211, COMP 4421, COMP 4901K in the same semester. I did not take other machine learning related course (including COMP 4471) in any semesters.",
            "comment_teaching": "1. Okay<br /><br />Sorry this is quite personal. Okay. James really like to put 'Okay' in each of his sentence. Although it didn't affect the teaching quality, okay, too much, it is quite annoying to hear his voice, okay. If you like statistics, okay, he said 394 'okay's out of 591 sentences in a single lecture (from zoom transcript, Nov 19). <br /><br /><br />2. Course Management<br /><br />The TAs are NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. The project instructions contains misleading extra information and contradictory statements. When you ask them for clarification, they like to rephrase the question and treat it as the answer. Most of the email I sent is CCed to the professor but he seems to not care about the poor replies at all.<br /><br /><br />3. Teaching Quality<br /><br />Back to the professor. You might argue that he teaches okay. That's true. He did try to cover the notes clearly with examples which is better that some slides-reading professor in the department. The problem is he teaches too slowly so only basic content is covered. It would be very boring for those who have some background knowledge. <br /><br />(Note: I usually spent time on preparation for each course before the course start. But even I have some background, most of the courses don't feel bored to me and I did gain quite a lot of insights from different courses.)<br /><br /><br />4. Classroom Interaction &amp; Atmosphere<br /><br />As the professor likes to see bored faces, there is a 10% participation component in the grading which requires everyone to turn on their webcam during lecture. It seems to me most of the students are doing their own stuff and the remaining are bored faces.<br /><br />He did try to setup some polls and ask us to type something in chat from time to time. This, however, has nothing to do with the webcam. Why not find webcam videos and play them during lecture? You can even find those videos that keep nodding too. It would be better to see people nodding instead of bored faces.<br /><br /><br />5. Presentation Sections<br /><br />The professor used four full lectures for student's presentation. If you don't want to teach, at least give us some more materials to read. Don't leave the course with untied ends. We don't even know how to tune a model!<br /><br /><br />6. What I have really learned... (Updated: Jan 13 2021)<br /><br />Some words about my feeling. Sorry for those who cannot read chinese (cantonese).<br /><br />如果你未睇曬個review 請你skip咗呢part睇埋落去先再返轉頭睇 🙏🏻<br />本來諗住四隻大字 喺呢到直接問候James家人算<br />但咁樣講唔出件事有幾L咁荒謬<br /><br />有人話「學校係現實社會嘅縮影」<br />也許之前我太年輕唔明當中意思<br />到今日我有好深體會<br /><br />跟制度玩拉吓freerider入組 輕鬆靚grade<br />默默耕耘 努力唔會俾人認可<br /><br />Prof有權有勢 唔聽人意見<br />同佢講嘢就似同唔同政見嘅人講嘢一樣 各有各講<br /><br />去周圍R人投訴 like同打氣收到好多<br />但真係肯簽名？人數真係唔多<br /><br />到真係迫到佢肯應機 就同你玩分化<br />特登強調如果改會有人會跌grade<br /><br />呢個course教我嘅唔係ML<br />係教我點樣如何係呢個荒謬嘅世界自處<br />點樣同隊友溝通？<br />點樣靠人際關係攞料？<br />點樣去同人/爛仔講數？<br />點樣去R人聯署支持？<br />點樣處理自己情緒？<br />仲有好多好多<br />講真 呢個course唔係叫Machine Learning嘅話 teaching我會俾A唔係E<br /><br />好多謝好多謝喺身邊幫我嘅每一位<br />多謝我嘅好隊友<br />多謝肯聽我呻 聽我放負嘅朋友<br />多謝幫過我share出去嘅人<br />無你哋我唔會行到咁遠<br /><br />自問自己一個學生哥 無能力改變啲咩<br />但我會盡我能力 將呢單嘢廣傳出去<br />懇請讀ust嘅你哋 提提身邊嘅朋友唔好中伏<br />James Kwok 你好快就會同隔離course Dekai Wu齊名<br /><br />公義短期之內都唔會來臨<br />但願佢只係遲到...<br />送俾大家一首我好鍾意嘅歌 RB嘅漫長<br />https://youtu.be/kM_DLxId8ok<br />呢幾日聽咗好多好多次...",
            "comment_grading": "0. Preface<br /><br />Please leave me a message if you find a course that has worse grading than this one. I will go say sorry to James.<br /><br /><br />1. Grading Distribution<br /><br />I think I don't need to say anything about how bullshit is this grading distribution. The numbers speak for themselves. Highest score in group project + full points everything else (98.2% overall) =&gt; A. Do you think 96.2% a good score? It is an A-. :D<br /><br />My score and statistics:<br />Assignment 1 (10%): 10/10 (Mean: 9.3)<br />Assignment 2 (10%): 9/10 (Mean: 6.9)<br />Assignment 3 (10%): 10/10 (Mean: 8.1)<br />Mini Project (20%): 20/20 (Mean: 17)<br />Final Project (40%): 95.5/100 (Mean: 65.3)<br />Participation (10%): 3/3 (Mean: 2.6)<br />Overall: 97.2% =&gt; A<br />(Statistics from Canvas, other stats such as SD are not released)<br />(Note: 95.5 is the highest group score for the project mentioned by the TA in email)<br /><br />Groupmate 1:<br />Assignments, Mini-project &amp; Participation: 60/60<br />Final Project: 95.5/100<br />Overall: 98.2% =&gt; A<br /><br />Groupmate 2:<br />Assignments, Mini-project &amp; Participation: 58/60<br />Final Project: 95.5/100<br />Overall: 96.2% =&gt; A-<br /><br />A friend from another group:<br />Assignments, Mini-project &amp; Participation: 57/60<br />Final Project: 83/100<br />Overall: 90.2% =&gt; B+<br /><br />More from this goop thread: https://hk.goop.ai/topic/ImuK/James-kwok-%E5%A5%BD%E7%88%9Bgrade<br /><br />Hall of Poor Grades:<br />85 B-<br />86 B<br />87.5 B<br />89 B<br />89.74 B+<br />90.2 B+<br />90.5 B+<br />92 B+<br />92.24 B+<br />96 A-<br />96.2 A-<br />96.5 A-<br />97 A<br />97.2 A<br />98.2 A<br />(From PMs and goop)<br /><br /><br />2. Effort Required to Achieve the Grade<br /><br />Please refer to the workload section. Want bad grades? Want stress? Good. Take this course. Work on the course materials full time and get a nice letter A.<br /><br /><br />3. Grading Transparency<br /><br />There is no information regarding to the final project grading, which takes up 40% of the whole course. We have zero idea on how it is graded. The TAs try to avoid answering anything related to the grading (refer to attachments). Is it really true that we need a perfect score to get an A+? No one will ever know.<br /><br /><br />4. Contribution Scheme (Updated: Jan 5 2021)<br /><br />From the new information that we have collected, we found there is a project score adjustment for groups that have unfair contributions. The formula is<br /><br />individual score = min(100, group score * (self contribution/expected contribution))<br /><br />The problem lies in a person can get a score much higher than the group score if the contribution is very unfair. This situation is not hypothetical. There is a 4-person group that has the following result:<br /><br />Member A: Contribution 38.04% Personal project score 100<br />Member B: Contribution 22.57% Personal project score 76.84<br />Member C/D omitted as it is not important to the calculation <br />Group Project Score: 76.84 / 90.29% = 85.1<br />(Names are anonymous for privacy reason)<br /><br />With some simple calculations, we can find Member A can get 129.49 points in the project if there is no cap (maximum of 100 score) applied! With such formula, Member A still get 100 points when their group project score is lowered to 65.72!<br /><br />So, what went wrong? (in case you are still not convinced that there is a problem)<br /><br />a) The effort and the score that can be obtained is NOT a linear relationship. For example, if you choose proj1, you can easily get &gt;60 score by spending three or four hours modifying a pretrained convnet without much tuning. (I received a PM saying he soloed proj1 in one day and get 70+.) However, if you aim for the 80~90 range, you must spend quite a few days tuning the model or implement a much complicated model (proj2).<br /><br />b) Groups with less than 4 person are severely penalized. According to the formula, for a 3 person group, each member are expected to take up 33.33% work each instead of 25% work. Our group was a 4 person group but one of our members dropped the course (smart choice!) so it becomes three. We pretty much have to do 25.0%/3=8.33% extra work without any rewards. Not to mention the results of our project would be much better if there is a fourth member helping us.<br /><br />c) It is impossible to get a group score of 100. There is a peer review component and it is impossible to get everyone to give you full points. As a member of the highest scored group, I would say it is impossible to get a significantly better result given the short time period. <br /><br />Do you understand what's the problem now? Ironically, the professor seems to be confused (or didn't even care/read) after we sent a long explanation to him (at least 4x longer than above). Refer to attachment for evidence.<br /><br /><br />5. Grade Review (Updated: Jan 24 2021)<br /><br />We have sent two separate grade review requests regrading the grading:<br />a) the unfair contribution scheme (as mentioned above, refer to workload section [5] for details)<br />b) groups that have student(s) dropping out of the course are expected to contribute more (not calculated as freeriders but less members)<br /><br />In short (more on workload section [5]), the grade review request is partially success and all members in my group have 1 subgrade up. We didn't find anyone else having their grades updated (plz let me know if you do).<br /><br />Updated grades:<br />Myself (97.2%): A =&gt; A+<br />Groupmate 1 (98.2%): A =&gt; A+<br />Groupmate 2 (96.2%): A- =&gt; A<br />We failed to find other student who have their grade updated.<br /><br />Although our group had our grades updated, I think this is still far from ideal. I apologize to those who have helped us fighting back the grades. We failed to get you all having a fair grade which I feel bad. I don't feel happy at all getting back the A+. To be honest, I don't really care if I do not get back the grade (that subgrade won't pull me up a lot anyway). We filed the request because the scheme is unfair - everyone should be assessed in a fair way. Most importantly, we want that stupid stubborn James to know HE IS WRONG.<br /><br />I will keep the grading as &quot;E&quot; due to the following:<br /><br />a) The scheme is still not transparent. We don't know how the revamped scheme work. I only received an email saying my final grade is updated to A+. I didn't receive other information regarding the appeal result.<br /><br />b) The grading cutoff is still high. My teammate who got 96.2% total still results in an A. One may say there are courses with similar cutoff. However, the points can be easily deducted due to careless mistakes in assignments. I got 1% of course grade (10% of an assignment) deducted due to a single line of function call missing.<br /><br />c) It is still unfair. It is understandable that it is not desirable to update the grades of everyone (especially those who may get their grades down). Despite that, there are much more thing that James and the TAs can do. A mass email explaining the situation to everyone? A less strict cutoff to balance the problem of the scheme? James did NONE of the these. He didn't even bother to solve anything before the department told him to.",
            "comment_workload": "1. Demanding Final Project &amp; HW<br /><br />The final project (topic 2) is an object detection system with Fast R-CNN. We have to follow the Fast R-CNN paper (with some modifications) to implement a turbulence detection system. The main overheads are the following:<br />- We have zero idea of Fast R-CNN before the project (so we need to read the papers)<br />- The instructions are vague, ambiguous and sometimes contradictory<br />- Object Proposal generation is time-consuming<br />- We don't have enough manpower and CPU/GPU power to debug everything<br /><br />We spent at least 6 days full-time working on the project. Two or three days are even in the exam period! We would consider ourselves as some of the top students in the CS department (at least in terms of GPA). Even we put so much effort in the project, we did not manage to get a good result. Anyway, it is the best among all groups. I feel so tired and stressed out for the project. I don't wanna touch it anymore.<br /><br />I will post the link to our project repo and powerpoint after obtaining permission from my groupmates.<br /><br />The HW is also quite long if you do try to spend time tuning the hyperparameters. However, the effort seems not to be credited as the final performance is not calculated in the marking scheme. (although it is mentioned in the instructions the performance will be considered)<br /><br /><br />2. Deadlines on Unusual Days<br /><br />The deadline of the final project is the last day of the exam period (22nd Dec). Glad that the final of my last subject is on 17th Dec so I can spend a few days full-time on the project. It would have been okay if the project had been released early. Sadly, it is released in late November so you have to deal with a shit heavy workload project alongside with your exam and end-of-semester work.<br /><br /><br />3. Required Attendance<br /><br />Attend the lecture or lose 10%. And that 10% difference will probably cost you a nice letter grade. :) The prof/TA didn't mention how the attendance is calculated so you are forced to attend every lecture to prevent point deduction. Combined with the fact that the lecture is boring and without verbal interactions, it feels quite tiring to attend all the lectures.<br /><br />The craziest thing is the professor move the last 4 lectures (presentation sections) to Dec 24 (Christmas Eve). Attendance is compulsory and we have a peer review form to fill in. That means, we have to listen to presentations of the same two topic for 5 hours and grade each of them. Great Christmas gift! Thank you professor!<br /><br /><br />4. Writing Follow-up Emails<br /><br />I don't want to count how many emails that we have sent to the TAs/professor. Sometimes, they like holding emails. Sometimes, they like to rephrase our questions and treat that as an answer. We got to a point that feeling sending emails asking for clarifications won't help at all. So, we implemented some parts of our project not following the exact instructions to make it work (or work better).<br /><br /><br />5. Writing Grade Review Email (Updated: Jan 24 2021)<br /><br />We have sent a grade review request email to the department due to the unfair grading scheme of the project (refer to Grading section for details). It took us almost 5 days to collect data, drafting the email, asking people to sign, etc. To be honest, I feel so exhausted that I still have to deal with this fu*king course after the end of semester.<br /><br />Link to email:<br />https://docs.google.com/document/d/118up9RW5ZoThLqWPuZkfD0XWIGr9Fq1UQjJRM3av8q8/edit?usp=sharing<br />(Names are removed for privacy reason)<br /><br />Previously, we put our contact method in this review for fellow victims to provide statistics, and sign the letter if they want. I would like to say a big THANK YOU to those who have provided statistics to us, especially those who have helped us signing the email. We finally manage to have 9 fellow students (out of 78) signing the email. <br /><br />To start off, we got a bullshit response by James. The department simply forward our email to James, and ask him to respond to the points. Let me translate his response: &quot;I think my scheme is good. You dumb as*es won't get your grades changed too much even if I change the scheme anyway.&quot; Attached is his reply (Warning: Please take care of your mental health. Seek help if needed). We filed another request for the issue that our teammate dropping out of the course after the group formation deadline. And, we got an even more ridiculous response from James (He said we should hire another freerider for better grades WTF). No other response from the department.<br /><br />I was fu*king hopeless at that point. It was going to end horribly. There were argues among our group. My groupmate even sent a not-so-polite email to ask the department for a fair judgement (which I can't completely agree). Clearly, James is a very clever &quot;old seafood&quot; (slang in Cantonese, meaning who have lots of experience in the workplace).<br /><br />The department responded us that they has just started conducting initial investigation. They said it was hard to get James' response. lol The department called a meeting (without James) to listen to our POV &amp; evidence. Then, there were no news ... until I found my grade updated in SIS a week after.<br /><br />We didn't really receive any official response from the department/James for the grade review request. The result is far from ideal and far from what we have expected (refer to grading section [5]). Sorry again for those who are still getting a bad grade. I don't have the energy to follow up this bullshit... I need some rest (and time to do my FYP. Sorry Desmond! :C)<br /><br /><br />6. It was just a Blackhole (Updated: Jan 13 2021)<br /><br />All in all, this course was a fu*king blackhole. You put in effort, you got back nothing. You want grades? Don't put in efforts. Don't try to make sound argument with James. Pray to god gifting you a freerider in your group (which can easily pull your grades to 100) was enough.<br /><br />I gave up my exam revision time. I gave up my Christmas Eve holiday. I gave up time doing my FYP. I gave up my sleeping time. The time that I spent in this course was way more than I did in COMP 2012H (which is famous for high workload). And... sigh... I don't know what to say anymore. <br /><br /><br />7. Writing Course Review (Updated: Jan 9 2021)<br /><br />I spent a lot of time writing this review. Please share it with your friends so there will be less people suffering from this kind of bullshxt. If you did take the course with us or COMP 4331 this semester, you can help by giving (anonymous) feedback to the university. <br /><br />http://qa.ust.hk/student_feedback.html<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to thank each of you who had helped to upvote and share the review. Without your help, we would not be able to find fellow victims to provide statistics. And, this review would not have been that impactful.",

He teaches perfectly good with good presentation and no accent. He can explain every single concept well, encourage students' participation and to communicate effectively with students and the TA.<br /><br />He manages time well, starts and ends each lesson on-time, cover all scheduled materials just-in-time, and release PAs and collect them at reasonable pace that can work as a consolidation on lecture materials. <br /><br />In conclusion, he is one of the best instructors in HKUST.",
            "comment_grading": "This grading scheme was for an online semester. No exam was scheduled for my semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not likely to happen for a F2F semester, so please reference to other threads if needed.<br /><br />PA1 10% - Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) on some toy datasets<br />PA2 15% - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on image classifier<br />PA3 15% - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) on fake news text detector<br /><br />Zoom Poll 10% - Each lecture one or two poll(s), half point for incorrect, full point for correct, no point for missed poll<br /><br />Project 1 30% - Work on one of the topics as asked (Not a &quot;freewill&quot; project). Download the dataset on your own and do whatever models you like. Make a report and video present afterwards. (Group of 2)<br /><br />Project 2 20% - Extended learning. On your own, read papers on one of the topics asked&nbsp;&nbsp;(again, not totally free choice), then film a 30-mins youtube video and teach your fellow students on the advanced topic. Video links are released to the rest of the class after the end of semester. (Single-person project)<br /><br /><br />Grading is fairly good.<br />My grade:<br />PA1: 100/100<br />PA2: 94/100<br />PA3: 98/100<br />Project 1: 96/100 (Mean 82.7, sd 17.8)<br />Project 2: 94/100 (Mean 88.6, sd 18.3)<br />Polling: About 85% in total (Mean about 77%)<br /><br />I am not sure about the mean of each PAs, but guess around 90 for PA1 and 80ish for PAs2/3.<br /><br />For the group project, you need to fill in a peer contribution table at the end of the report where it may adjust your individual score from the group score. However, I am not sure how it actually works coz my group just peacefully wrote 50:50 among me and my partner.<br /><br />My Final Letter Grade: A<br /><br />Fair grading.",
            "comment_workload": "Workloads are fine for the PAs, which have 2-3 weeks to complete for each. However, note that no skeleton codes are provided and you need to start everything from scratch starting from packages installing and importing. Some labs may be useful for references though.<br /><br />Each PA took me around two full days to work on the codes and an extra&nbsp;&nbsp;day for writing up report. If you aim for perfection, make sure to do each step carefully and write your report clearly according to the guidelines. Minor typo in the code may make huge difference or even a complete wrong in your final submission. Start early because random bugs are likely and training time can be long for ML assignments.<br /><br />The workloads suddenly increased steeply towards the end of the semester, where we have our Project 1 due in week 12 and Project 2 due in week 13. These two projects take some times in report writing and making powerpoint slides for filming the video if you aim for excellence. For me, I worked overnight for two days to complete Project 1.<br /><br />You will get two NQA coupons (i.e. late days) for the whole semester where you can use on any assignment or project.",

I take this course and spend much effort on it because I think I will not have time to really study hard in ML/AI MOOCs and I want to force myself to learn ML (as I believe this time I did not learn ML I would have to learn it in the future at a more 'painful' cost when staying in IT-related industries or computer science postgraduate studies).<br /><br />[2018/05/28]Luckily the course materials have been revised to include Tensorflow now...",

Furthermore, the overall grading scheme of the final is quite unclear too. (I guess the professor just grades your total contribution mainly based on your contribution to the presentation.

Maybe due to DY is the head of the department, he tend to give grade by following normal standard.<br /><br />For me, I could say, I really calculated the mean stats and my overall marks, after than I compared two marks to see how I differ from mean score.<br /><br />My overall percentage is somehow 82.1x% and mean percentage is 82.0x%. Mean score brought me a B grade. Therefore I think that is a fair grading.<br /><br />One more thing: The marking standard is very transparent. For each assessment, TA will give you feedback on each question and send you through email. It is sure that you can learn from your mistakes by reading the feedback.",

While I searched the assignment 2 given last year, it only required a single-label CNN only. I am very sure the workload has been upgraded in this semester.<br /><br />But to be fair, if you are prepared, the assignments should not be hard and should not take you lots of time.",
