I think this number of people is quite a lot and according to what is taught in this course (more people in a group, less motivation to work because you expect others will work), you must expect there are some free-riders in your group. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I suggest attending the consultation session because Ellick explains what he expects us to do in the group project more thoroughly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You are expected to define the iv (independent variable), dv (dependent variable) and contingency factor, give an introduction of the assigned research paper and come up with a solution (which is also the iv) based on the evidence suggested by the research paper. Remember all the things need to be supported by evidence from the research paper. <br /><br />- Research:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There are 3 online research studies posted on Canvas. Each consists of 4 parts and takes around 1 hour to complete. Just answering some questions. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Remember to finish all to get full credit for the research participation.",

She's also very friendly and warm which makes it pleasant for us to hear her speak. The pace of teaching is appropriate (to me) so you won't feel like some parts are a waste of time.<br /><br />MGMT is supposed to be boring in general but she plays a lot of relevant videos (especially real-life experiments) which are quite interesting and helps us understand the concepts very well ( some Qs in the MT are related to the videos too so better pay attention :) ). <br /><br />She also occasionally sets up case exercises (I won't spoil them or it won't be fun for you) and in-class discussions for some topics which have case studies, which are quite entertaining and engaging too so I can almost guarantee you that you won't get bored from attending her lectures.",

But I highly recommend you to speak up since that's just the only criterion to get the mark (as long as you type what you said in class in the discussion board for each class, which will be closed b4 next class)<br /><br />The MT is MC and the Final is Essay.

I was kinda bummed since out of the 5 group members, only me and one other group member was kinda engaged in it so it's a little bit hard for me to work well on it. In this sem, the prof forms the group for us, so good luck! And make sure you choose a movie most groupmates have watched so it'll be easier to discuss the OB issues.<br /><br />The research credit is easy to obtain, just remember to read the email.

(Lucia calls it a reference sheet, not a cheatsheet.) Just put every single thing in the lecture notes on the cheatsheet. Then getting above 1 sd should be super easy. The mean was pretty high, 46/60, and the sd was around 6. I got 56/60, which was about 1.7 sd above.<br /><br />I felt the final exam was pretty hard because all the questions were essay-type questions. You can't solve them easily unless you perfectly understand the concepts and their applications. It is unlike midterm. Actually the cheatsheet was useless.<br /><br />The group project is identifying OB concepts from movies and relating them to real applications. 5-6 people per group. I think all the groups got similar scores... so getting high scores on midterm and final is important. Of course, group project is important too as it accounts for 30% of the total grade.<br /><br />For class &amp; research participation, just make sure to go to the lectures and 3 research sessions.<br /><br />Final and project grades unknown.<br />Final grade = A+",

I participated all lessons and answered questions for 1-2 times.<br /><br />Attendance is needed by doing in-class exercise. You'd better answer questions for participation points.<br /><br />Group project is easy to do. You just have to watch a movie and write report then do presentation. Nothing hard or difficult. Just describe the movie and analyse the movie with OB theories.<br /><br />For exam, it is fully open book that you can just print out all the notes and lecture slides for your own reference in the exams. There are MCs and essay questions (not very long one) BTW she might ask you to write down your own experience for some OB theories and explain why it happens, you'd better brainstorm more before you sit for the exams.<br /><br />You will have consultation for project. You can first have a draft of what you are going to do before consultation. Then you can ask for her opinions. We asked Carmen to comment on our ideas and points and she approved all the points we had and recommended us to cut some of them or it might exceed the page limit. Carmen is a professor who would give you a lot of useful and concrete advice on your group project and I think that's the reason why we are having high marks. She will tell you this one you should do and that one you should not do. We worked according to her comments and get high marks.",

Midterm and Final exam is very easy if you just pay attention in lectures. You don't need much time to do self-studying. For the project, her grading is not strict at all, we submitted and presented a half-assed project. But voila, it almost score the maximum we could get in the project. For the attendance part, you just need to speak out once in class, every class, and you get the participation point. But turned out many like me didn't even take the chance to get the easiest grades ever, but still I got a good final letter grade.",

She makes classes very interesting with activities, videos and general discussions.

The group project includes two reports and a presentation. The format of the report is given.

There are a few assignments (some required, some optional) throughout the course for credit (they're super simple and short quizzes or writing tasks). Optional assignments give you extra credit. The group project really depends on your team (it's luck because it's assigned). Different friends of mine had varied approaches when it came to the project (most commonly they split a group of 6 into three teams of 2 to work on one OB issue), but my group all worked on every OB issue together based on the formatting for the report. If you work progressively throughout the semester, the workload is manageable.",

She has a strong hk accent when she spoke in English but she explains the content clearly, and she welcomes her students to ask questions whenever they don't understand. She is always fun in class!! She tries to joke sometimes. There are also breakout room discussions (in random groups for each lesson) and each group has to submit a file on Canvas at the end of the class. We will sometimes watch videos together that makes the class less boring. Overall I like her teaching style!",

(Though I did not answer any questions) Do remember to do the research surveys else you will lose points.<br /><br />For the project part, my group worked hard but the other groups are much better, we got 2-3 points below mean:((( It is about a movie related to Organisational Behaviour. You just have to analyse the movie and then write about the related OB issues - not that hard to handle, but sadly we did not manage to score a better mark.<br /><br />There is 1 midterm and 1 final exam, for the midterm all of them are Multiple Choice questions, that you have to understand the concepts clearly before the exam; but in the final they are all in the form of long questions, you have to type it out in a Word Document and submit it on Canvas.

When we have questions, she is always happy to help us with detailed and clear explanation. The whole class loves her sooo much. :P<br /><br />Overall, I think her teaching quality is pretty nice. She has a structured ppt with bullet points and it is good for revision. I'm also quite impressed that her time management for the lesson is quite well. She can always manage to finish everything on time.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!",
            "comment_grading": "For me, grading is very nice. The midterm is all MC questions and final is short questions. Those questions are kind of straightforward. (Just some traps for the MC and you have to pay close attention to it) <br /><br />For the participation marks, you have to get it by answering questions that Carmen has asked during the lesson, and doing some group assignments in breakout room. I am not sure how many marks does answering one question worth tho.<br /><br />The project is not that difficult. It's mainly about presenting a movie using those concepts taught (stuff like that)<br /><br />Also there is a part called research participation. Just attend it and you will get full marks for that. <br />(Basically everyone scored full marks)<br /><br />Overall, the mean of the grading should be around B/ B+. A lot of my friends got A range in Carmen's class :D Good luck!!",

The main workload should be the project, just pray that you won't have free riders in your group (sadly my group has 1 so u know ...)<br /><br />For the mid-term and final, i didn't really spend time revising it. Paying attention during lessons and flipping through the notes the day before the exam will be fine.",

Like me, I encountered free-riders in my team and I need to deal with part of their jobs as well so the workload was quite heavy to me. Similar to the exams, the project examines the degree of your ability to apply OB concepts in your chosen movie while the presentation is testing your communication skills and team dynamics. Since the presentation will be spread out in 3-4 lessons, if you are arranged to present on the first day of the presentation, you might feel more pressured as it is the day of your final report deadline as well. And for the others, they might have more time to prepare for the power point and presentation. So, the workload depends.",

So I had a friend who scored higher than me in literally every aspect of the course (except for class participation probably because I was pretty much always in class and contributed A LOT to discussions), BUT she got a B and I got an A so not sure how that happened. Her grading could be slightly subjective, but i really can't tell. <br />Just another heads up this is one of those courses where a whole bunch of things add up towards your big grade. The weighting is all spread out through your coursework and final and midterm exams, so it's ok if you don't score super high in your exams because you can still make up for it with your coursework.",

Since the content was very easy to understand writing the report was not a major issue. <br />In terms of the presentation, my group spent a lot of time on it and it turned out really good. We didn't get the best grade for it tho, but I was still really happy with it. We needed to make it creative yet informative too. Remember with the presentation if your group presents first in a 9am class, chances are even if you have the best presentation ever, you won't get voted by your peers for best presentation because none of them will be there since no one shows up to a 9am class on time lol. So my group missed out on super important bonus points just because we presented first and a random group that presented last would always win it regardless of how good their presentations were. <br />Mid-term she gave us a cheat sheet so that was great even though we really didn't need it. All multiple choice<br />Final no cheat sheet and was essay-based questions, super easy one of my favorite finals to write.",

Those questions are just common sense and related to video/content she shared in the class. <br />The Prof will jot down your name and further remember your name if you answered questions. <br />Also, you can try to initiate a discussion on the canvas discussion board. I think it will help too. <br /><br />Add oil with ur project, the workload is light. Peer evaluation will take place after the presentation.<br /><br />For mid-term &amp; Final, <br />Mid term is in MC. I didn't study + have super urgent things to do. I just randomly fill in the MC sheet and left, turn out I was the lowest in class. <br /><br />As for the final exam, it includes short questions and long questions. She will give out the exam syllabus/related topic list beforehand (the last lesson). All you have to do is to research more information regarding the topic and revise them all coz you are not allowed to make cheatsheet. <br />Believe it or not, I got full marks in the final and got a B- grade at last.",
            "comment_workload": "The only workload is just the project + there are 6 ppl in one group. So it doesn't take you much time. <br /><br />If you really wanna invest your time in this course, do revise the ppt and important content. This course is all about being proactive in class and memorise things that tested in the final exam.<br /><br />I would say it is really a good course. <br />Do study hard if you wanna &quot;chok grade&quot; or get MGMT major",

Also, her PPT is very simple and easy to read with very little text, so reviewing for exams are not that hard. In addition, I feel like I already understand a lot just by listening in class.<br /><br />The class itself does not only consist of listening to her talk on and on for 1 hour. Instead, she divide it between lectures, interactive exercises, videos, mini case analysis, and discussions. You will never get bored.<br /><br />We also get to do a lot of personality tests and its always fun to know more about yourself, especially with Lucia to explain what each of the personality means and its strengths and weaknesses etc.<br /><br />Always finishes class 10-15 minutes early after taking attendance by IPRS.

A lot of it is based on concepts from psychology and sociology, so it helps if you have a background in those subjects (you might be a little bit more familiar with the terms etc).",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Farh is a really engaging professor who tries his very best to make sure his students understand the content and are coping well with the workload. He is always open to answering questions, and is very helpful. I approached him a few times with regards to the group project, and he was very helpful and even sent me some research journals related to the topic of our research paper. He is really kind and approachable, and is definitely one of the friendliest professors I've had.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading was pretty decent for the course. There is one midterm, a group project (research paper), in-class exercises, attendance, and a final exam which make up your final grade for the course. In the midterm, I got 1 SD above mean, however I don't know the marks for my final exam or report as they were not released (however, I was very satisfied with my performance on both and think I did well). In-class attendance is taken through the PRS system, and it helps to go to lecture as participation makes up around 14% of your grade. In the end, I got an A+ for this course.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was alright, as there are assigned readings before each class. Although it is not required, I recommend you do the readings as they help you to keep up with the material on the class. Also, the final exam had some questions on content which was in the assigned readings but wasn't covered explicitly in class, so I advise you to complete the readings. The majority of the workload, however, comes from the group project where you have to write a research paper on a OB topic (you are given 4 general areas, and have to choose one). If you have group mates that don't do much, good luck, because you'll need it. I highly recommend that you DON'T leave the paper until the last minute, because it takes a lot of time and effort to produce a good and thorough paper. There is also a presentation to complete based on your research paper, however it's not as tough and the professor is quite lenient with the presentation (just make it interesting and engaging and Professor Farh will like it).",

Examination II (final) is essay writing and one cheat sheet is allowed for the exam. Final is non-cumulative covering the second part of course. Group project is a disaster if you have free riders in the group, it is divided into two parts, written report (15%) and presentation (15%). Participation is basically attendance and some group activities.<br /><br />The final grade is rather disappointing tho. I scored 1.2SD higher in midterms and participated in class actively but end up only B+. I emailed Prof. Chao and the TA regarding the grade and the reason is that I did badly for my final short essays even though my marks for midterm, long essay and participation are above average.

His teaching is very structured.",

Midterm has a high mean, it was around 82% for my class.<br /><br />Assignment 40% (20% presentation, 16% report, 4% progress report: Need to select a movie and analyze the OB theories within it, and present findings. Progress report is a simple 1 page report that you submit a month into the course, then you do a presentation to the whole class, and also prepare a comprehensive report of your findings. <br />*Innovativeness and creativity will be rewarded in your presentations.<br />**Class vote at the end of each day of presentation ,and winner receives bonus marks.<br /><br />Final Exam 25%: Non cumulative exam, semi MCQ, semi essay based. Similar comment to the Midterm. <br /><br />- About the exams, it is vital that you attend classes, and take part actively in the cases and experiments. Questions about these come up very regularly in his exams, as he is an avid believer in the takeaways/conclusions, as opposed to the theories themselves.",
