Take data時哪裡需要密一點疏一點自己決定，決定前先想想你result要做什麼analysis,。這個不一定變得快就take得密一點的。這個要耐心...<br />4. 要寫Labnote<br /><br /><br />format:<br />一個Lab做兩個星期，每一個星期去兩次lab。每個lab有兩至三個sub-task，所以基本去一次lab做完一個sub-task就差不多。<br /><br />特別說一下optics。你這個lab data漂亮不漂亮基本取決于你alignment做的好不好，如果alignment差你在變換距離後可能什麼也看不到。",

Discussion(Analysis+Question answering) <br />5. Conclusion (What you have learnt, 這部分我經常忘記）<br />建議去lab前先把procedure寫完，然後隨做實驗隨寫。<br /><br />Lab summary:<br />這個基本和以前做開的lab summary 差不多<br />1. Background<br />2. Theories<br />3. Result and Discussion<br />這個result可以refer labnote的內容，不用再寫一次。<br />4. Conclusion<br /><br />Lab&nbsp;&nbsp;report:<br />這個沒什麼好說的，基本就是找一份Lab summary然後加上些圖，summary，citation之類的東西。不過占分還挺多的，修飾一下就行。",

The experiments are as follows:<br /><br />O1. Basic Optical Systems<br />O2. Application of interferometry<br />O3. Waveguides and Optical Fibers<br />O4. Application of Optical Spectroscopy<br />O5. Semiconductor Laser Diodes<br />O6. Experiential Lab: Special Topics in Optical Physics<br /><br />The experiments are fairly sophisticated and cover some interesting phenomena. You also get introduced to a whole new range of optical devices.<br /><br />Because this was an online sem, the O6 lab was reduced to something very basic that you could do by yourself at home. For e.g. investigating interference patterns in water or between two speakers. You are free to design whatever experiment you want as long as it is closely related to optics.<br /><br />You need to submit a lab notebook for each lab from O1 to O5.&nbsp;&nbsp;O3 needs an additional lab report (worth 25% of the grade!). O6 only needs a report but is comparatively longer.",

The average overall score was in the low 80s. I think you need a 90%+ for A+ and a score around mean will warrant a B+/ A- depending on the batch of students.",

However, since the sem was in online mode, we could use Word or Latex to make our notebooks for a softcopy submission instead of the usual handwritten ones so that made things a bit easier.
