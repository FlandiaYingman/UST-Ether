I'm at average in both mid-terms and final exam.<br />But the method they used during exams could be a bit inconvenient. To protect their exam papers from being leaked, the professor will share his screen so everyone can view the online exam pdf. If you need to view the questions, you have to tell him via Zoom. For this reason, I strongly suggest using snipping tools to screenshot the questions and save them somewhere else, so you can freely view any question without disturbing others (if classes continue to be conducted online).",

Different from previous MATH courses, we do not use online websites such as Webwork to hand them in. Instead, you need to included steps for every question (which costs 2 marks each), which is good. Their grading is very flexible. As long as your final answer is correct, I don't think steps really matter haha XD",

The professor is easily understandable, with his accent not being too thick.<br /><br />Lectures consists of the professor basically transferring the content of the book to the board, and the example questions he presents on the board are the same questions as seen in the book. So anyone can just read the book if they do not want to attend the lecture. However, the professor does explain step by step how he is able to solve the differential equations, and he will very helpfully and willingly answer questions after class. The professor will often add notes of his own in addition to the content on the book in order to explain concepts more clearly, so I do find going to lectures helped me a lot.<br /><br />The lessons will include the professor talking about the topic for about half a lesson, then giving students a 5 minute break, before continuing with the rest of the lesson.",

In general, you don't need a thorough understanding to perform well in the exams, as long as you know the formulas and calculation steps well.

The final lasted 2 hours with 6 questions. Both only focus on calculation, and the difficulty is only a bit harder/more tedious than the homework questions.

He never seemed to miss key points. <br /><br />He taught us how to solve a number of sample questions, which mostly appeared in the exams. He is a typical good teacher being very willing to adjust his teaching pace in accordance with our rate of “absorption”. <br /><br />He asked us at least three times a lesson whether we could catch up with what he taught, unlike many teachers who would just “teach to themselves” throughout a lesson.<br /><br />Well, perhaps because the content was a bit too difficult for me, I did miss a few lessons or sleep during some of his lessons. Still, I could catch up without significant issues.<br /><br />As for the TA, who revisited the lecture content in the weekly tutorial sessions, he might only be a good researcher because it was very hard to understand something from him. <br /><br />Some people said that the tutorial sessions were more important than the lectures, but I disagree.",

Most of the homework I handed in was below mean, except for three out of eleven.<br /><br />Yet, I managed to get C+ .<br /><br />Conclusion：Good Grade",

Actually you do not need to spend a lot of time studying for this course in order to get good grade, you just need to go over the tutorial notes and practice questions on it before the exams. Once you are pretty familiar with those questions, you would do fine because the exams would not include questions other than those on the slides. <br />10% homework<br />30% midterm mean: 65<br />60% final exam mean: 71<br />I got 87 for midterm and 100 for final, yielded an A+.",
