            "comment_teaching": "I think Prof Chan is a dedicated teacher in this field with unique teaching styles. In addition to the animated videos from his edx courses, the IPRS quizzes are like the fun reality show games which may need us to decide the answer in the limited time. Although there are some difficult formulas, Prof can highlight the important concepts. He also made the class more engaging with some background stories behind the inventions and papers related to the topics.",
            "comment_grading": "Generous, Prof said he will try not to fail us unless something serious. The important thing is that we are learning.<br /><br />IPRS exercises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%<br />Homework:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%<br />Quizzes:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30%<br />Term Project:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%",
            "comment_workload": "Compared to other PG ELEC courses, I think this course is lighter. For the IPRS and quizzes, I suggest to revise based on the Canvas videos and lecture slides. Homework questions may slightly differ from previous years, however as long as you have the concepts you will be fine. The term project requires a paper report based on the TCAD simulation and physics insights of the devices in the topics which we choose a month before the deadline. You can refer to some sample TCAD scripts in the official Silvaco Atlas website for inspiration.",
