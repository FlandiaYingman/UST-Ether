        "description": "The increasing use of the Internet and online communities in the last decade has led to an explosion of social data capturing every aspect of our daily activities. The new digital data have in turn led to the rise of Computational Social Science, an emerging field that aims to empirically study social behavior by applying computational methods, algorithms, and models on \"big data\". This course introduces the methods and ideas of computational social sciences. The course consists of lectures, projects and tutorials. Students will learn and evaluate the new possibilities and challenges that digital data have created for studying social phenomena. Students will also learn and practice essential methods that are needed to analyze digital data, from data collection to techniques and methods to analyze big data.",
