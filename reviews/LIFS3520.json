Each student will conduct the bench work for the proposal developed in the prerequisite course LIFS 3510 and hence under the same faculty supervisor as LIFS 3510. Due to the short duration, emphasis is on appreciation of the research process rather than results obtained. Approval of a faculty supervisor is required for students to enroll in the course.
