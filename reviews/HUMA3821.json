        "description": "This course concerns the major schools of Chinese Philosophy in the most formative years of the Pre-Qin period, before the unification of China in 221 BCE. Focus will be on the Confucian school beginning with Confucius, and as developed by Mencius and Xunzi, and the Daoist school as represented by Laozi and Zhuangzi. The relation between these two schools and their challengers such as the Mohists, Legalists, and Yang Zhu will be explored. Students are required to read and analyze English translations of selected passages from the Confucian and Daoist texts, discussing various interpretations.",
