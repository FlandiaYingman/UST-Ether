They don’t really provide a rubric, so make sure to ask what she’s looking for before you work on your group project/assignments/paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The quiz (basically a final) was unexpectedly a little tricky, but mainly due to time pressure and misreading the question. There were many parts to each questions, so make sure you answer all the sub-questions.",

Make sure to ask the professor if your group is heading towards the right direction as you are designing your experiment.<br /><br />Peer review paper is not too difficult too since there’s word limit to it, but I suggest you to take notes of other group’s presentation so you don’t have to waste time rewatching their presentation.",

However, the examples are not in the ppt which make us a bit difficult to understand as we need to interpret the meanings behind by ourselves. <br /><br />She is not that kind of funny professor but at least she is a local professor so you can fully understand her lecture very well. She is very nice and patient when it comes to answering our questions. I think most of us struggle in understanding the concepts as some contents are quite tricky and advanced.
