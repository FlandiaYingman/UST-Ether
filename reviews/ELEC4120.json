            "comment_content": "This is a standard networking course which covers four out of five layers of networking:<br /><br />1. Application Layer (HTTP, DNS, CDN)<br />2. Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)<br />3. Network Layer (IP, ICMP, routing)<br />4. Link Layer (CRC code, ALOHA, CSMA, MAC)<br />5. Physical Layer (Not included)<br /><br />The content are mostly some introduction and simple math calculations. It's more like a 1000-level intro course than a 4000-level course.<br /><br />The order is different from other standard networking courses. Most networking courses cover the layers top-down: from the top application layer, and move downward. In this course, we cover the network layer (in the middle) first because the professor thinks the concept of address is important. It is weird but it makes sense somehow.",
            "comment_teaching": "I truly enjoyed Prof. Lea's classes throughout the semester. He has been enthusiastic, and the content is thought-provoking. He often ask us questions to let us think more before he gives out the answer. He did a good job stimulating our interest to the topic.<br /><br />Never he read out the PowerPoint directly. But he focuses on some of the main points and do elaboration. He often tries to repeat the points if those are important. He will do some demos like using the traceroute program instead of going through lots of text.<br /><br />It is funny that he tries to draw picture using MS paint to explain things. Quite cute lol.<br /><br />One downside is the powerpoint slides and HWs are quite messy, in terms of the formatting (typesetting). Some of the slides has their orientation wrong, some figures are not aligned with the question. Once I got a question in my HW wrong because I misread the figure from another question......<br /><br />Also, the TAs make LOTS of mistake. So, be aware. I believe they are nice people tho.<br /><br />I took COMP 3511 in the same semester. It really makes a good contrast.",
            "comment_grading": "I don't know exactly the grading curve of this course. But it should be quite nice (plz refer to other reviews). If you have attended all the lectures and go through some of the sources (past HW and exams), it would be no problem to be above mean.<br /><br />What I can say is the A+ cutoff is not high compared to other courses. My performance in some of the HW are quite bad. And in the midterm, most people got full score or 38/40. I thought A+ would not be possible. <br /><br />HW: 38/39, 32/32, 35/36, 28/36, 32/32, 32/36, 26/34 (Lowest score HW will be dropped)<br />Midterm: 36/40 (Mean: 32.6, Max: 40)<br />Final: 54/58 (Mean: 37.4, Max: 56)<br />Project: completed<br />Overall: A+<br /><br />SD is not released.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload comes from the weekly/biweekly HW. Most answers are given in the tutorial in a form of 'hints', or can be copied directly from past HW. But still, it may take a bit of time complete them by yourself.<br /><br />The project is sending an encrypted e-mail to the professor. Don't worry. There is unlimited tries and the professor will help you out if you got any problems.<br /><br />The midterm and exam are open-book so you don't need to do a lot of preparation. Midterm questions comes from HW and past HW problems, so it is easy to get full unless you got the calculations wrongly. Exam questions are new, but you will find them familiar if you have attended the lectures. Most of them are points being emphasized by the professor during lecture time.<br /><br />So, go to coursehero and get every source that you can get. Attend all lectures and try to understand the content. Then, you will be good to go.",
