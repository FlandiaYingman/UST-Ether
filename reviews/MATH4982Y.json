        "description": "In this course, we shall study games of incomplete information. As a starting point, we first explore the equilibrium concepts (Bayesian Nash Equilibrium and Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium) adopted in this class of games and develop relevant theories. Next, we shall explore the application of incomplete information games including auction games, job market signaling games, capital financing etc.. To enroll this course, students are expected to have solid knowledge in game theory, basic probability theory and calculus. Students should seek instructorâ€™s approval to take this course.",
