It provides an overview of the marketplace and includes such VC topics as: (1) VC personnel and compensation; (2) deal structuring; (3) due diligence and post-investment management; (4) valuation techniques; (5) negotiating investment term sheets; (6) going public and other divestment (\"exit\") strategies. Real world examples and cases, primarily from Asia, will be used to illustrate these topics.
