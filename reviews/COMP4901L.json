A lot of Math.<br /><br />Different to COMP4901J/COMP4471, this course includes computer vision techniques that both learning and non-learning based. Most of the parts have heavy dependence on Math.<br /><br />Just like CK's other courses, the content is a direct copy of the material of other universities:<br />http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16385/<br /><br />In case the link is dead, here lists the topics:<br />1. Image filtering<br />2. Image pyramids and (some) Fourier transform<br />3. Hough transform<br />4. Corner detection<br />5. Feature descriptors and matching<br />6. 2D transformations<br />7. Image homographies<br />8. Camera models<br />9. Two-view geometry<br />10. Stereo<br />11. Structure from motion<br />12. Radiometry and reflectance<br />13. Photometric stereo and shape from shading<br />14. Introduction to recognition<br />15. Bag of words<br />16. Neural networks<br />17. Convolutional neural network<br />18. Optical flow<br />19. Alignment and tracking<br />20. Graph-based methods<br /><br />Yes, as you can see, a terribly long list of content, and there are ~200 slides in each topic.",
            "comment_teaching": "CK speaks rapidly but in a stammering way. It can be hard to understand. And eventually you will get used to it.<br /><br />The real challenge is not his English, but the content. He expects you have a strong CV sense and understand things super quickly. He did not stop at one point explaining things until clear, but skipped as long as he could.<br /><br />If you are not genius, I would recommend you spend some time preparing before the lecture.",
            "comment_grading": "72% - 6 project assignments<br />28% - Final Exam<br /><br />As we were unable to have on-campus teaching and exam in late November, it became<br />100% - 7 project assignments (with bonus)<br /><br />Intake Requirement<br />CGA cutoff: ~3.5<br />Good grades in Math courses<br />mean CGA: ~3.8<br /><br />As most of the students are already A rankers, CK gave &gt;50% A range. You'll get an A easily if you score almost full mark in all assignments and complete all bonuses.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is pretty heavy.<br /><br />You have 2 weeks for each project assignment. They usually compose of a theory part with short questions and a programming part requiring you to write several Matlab scripts. You can either form a group of 2 or work individually for project assignments. I chose to cope with them individually, and each assignment costs me ~2/3 full days.",
