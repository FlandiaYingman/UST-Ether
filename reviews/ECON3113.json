            "comment_content": "This is the first course in intermediate microeconomics. This course mainly covers demand-side stuff, which is all about utility analysis. You will see tonnes of math in this course so you have to be very familiar with math, especially multivariate differentiation, Lagrangian method, vectors and some proof techniques from math analysis (MATH2033). The prerequisite of this course will change to MATH2023 or ECON2174 in next spring semester.<br /><br />The professor will also share a lot of things or extra knowledge about the field of economics so we can be 'professional' in economics.<br /><br />Course Content:<br />1. Introduction, preference relation, axioms of preference<br />2. Utility, indifference curves<br />3. Properties of indifference curves and their proofs<br />4. Cardinal utility and ordinary utility, popular forms of utility functions<br />5. Budget constraints and utility maximization<br />6. Application of utility analysis on labor<br />--------------------- Midterm 1 ---------------------<br />7. Application of utility analysis on time preference and tax preference<br />8. Marshallian demand and Hicksian demand, properties of demand and their proofs<br />9. Substitution and income effects<br />10. Definitions of different goods, definitions of different elasticities, relations between goods and elasticities<br />11. Consumer Price Index<br />--------------------- Midterm 2 ---------------------<br />12. Consumer surplus<br />13. Uncertainty, expected utility, definitions and proofs of risk preference<br />14. Application of expected utility on insurance, moral hazard, adverse selection<br /><br />I strongly recommend MAEC students take this course together with MATH4512 as there are some overlapping.",
            "comment_teaching": "As every student of this course is from ECOF or MAEC, who are 'elites' of ECON department and SF Leung is the department head of ECON department, SF Leung is like our 'form teacher'. Not only does he teach us knowledge in this course, but he also shares a lot of extra stuff of economics and tells us about career selection or postgraduate studies.<br /><br />In terms of teaching, SF Leung was definitely superior. He always inspired us to think a lot and also to apply economics theory into real life, which I think is super important in university study. He was also able to present complicated math in a neat and tidy way. His English was also very easy to follow. However, sometimes he would 'blow water' blow too much so that he could not finish the schedule on time and had to take over the tutorial, making a three-hour lecture.<br /><br />The tutor was also good. He would try to help you solve some questions and problems arose in lectures. Every tutorial, the tutor gave out a quiz which would include in the grading of the course (even in the first week of the semester).",

Easy to get full mark.<br /><br />The exams are very long and very difficult. So make sure you prepare well before going to the exams! Usually is 50% 'IQ questions' and 50% math questions. I don't suggest you spend too much time on IQ questions which are all or nothing.<br /><br />Performance in Midterm 1<br />Mean: 49.98/80<br />Standard Deviation: 9.98<br />Performance in Midterm 2<br />Mean: 31.3/80<br />Standard Deviation: N/A<br />Performance in Final<br />Mean: 64.15/180<br />Standard Deviation: 23.59<br /><br />My performance<br />I am quite sure that I got full in lecture and tutorial participation<br />Midterm 1: 61.5/80<br />Midterm 2: 48/80 ( I accidentally miss 1 page, lost 18/80)<br />Final: 110/180<br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />The grading is definitely much better than average in UST. 但係佢係唔會派A+架= =",

Preference, Utility and Choice<br />The most important basic of this course, deriving the relationship between Choice Coherence &lt;--&gt; Complete, Transitive Preference &lt;--&gt; Utility Maximization<br />The proofs are quite mathematical oriented and complex, will not be examined. However we should know their properties.<br /><br />3. Structural Properties of Utility Functions<br />Introduce Indifference curve and those &quot;Nice&quot; properties that will be used in Utility Maximization problem later; Marginal Rate of Substitutes; Cobb-Douglas, Quasi-linear Utility functions.<br />Multivariable Calculus is required here, knowing how to compute partial derivatives is sufficient.<br /><br />4. Theory of Utility Maximization<br />Constrained Maximization Problems. Recipes for solving: First-order-condition, Lagrange method (not examined)<br /><br />5. Application of Utility Maximization<br />-Lump-Sum principle: income tax v.s. sales tax<br />-Intertemporal Consumption<br /><br />6. Demand Analysis<br />Derive Compensated Demand Curve and Regular Demand Curve from Utility Maximization Problem; Substitution Effect and Income Effect; Normal Goods, Inferior Goods, Giffen Goods<br /><br />7. Revealed Preference<br />How to tell the consumer is maximizing utility from her choice behavior.<br /><br />---Start from here the topics are more related to decision making under risk and uncertainty---<br />8. Expected Utility<br />Lotteries, Independent Axiom, v-NM utility function<br /><br />9. Risk Attitude<br />How to tell the consumer's risk attitude by the concavity of v-NM utility functions; Risk Premium;<br /><br />10. Risk Bearing<br />State-space approach for decision making under risk and uncertainty, similar to constrained maximization problem before. Extremely useful and inspiring. Cases like Asset investment/ Insurance is covered.<br /><br />---Information Asymmetry---<br />11. Modelling Information<br />Introduction to information, similar to basic probability theory.<br /><br />12. Adverse Selection<br />The possible disadvantage of Information Asymmetry. Lemon Market.<br /><br />13. Signaling<br />How to solve Information Asymmetry through signaling. Very powerful tool matching a lot of phenomenon in real world.",
            "comment_teaching": "New prof that came to UST last year.<br />Extremely good teaching.<br />Local should find his English very easy to follow (very typical HK accent)<br /><br />Perfect in terms of explanations, he will tell you the whole story in each topic with extremely strict logic (he seldom makes mistake).<br />One bad thing is you have to be extremely focused to follow his derivation. Do remember to write down some notes.<br /><br />His notes is very clean in the sense that you basically cannot get the full picture by simply reading the notes. Therefore better to attend to lecture.<br /><br />He will spend some time each lesson reviewing last lecture's material. Sometimes he repeated some key insight/derivation too much that makes the class a bit boring.<br />Always overrun the lecture by 5-10 mins, but I admire his detailed explanations :)<br /><br />TA Dominic, needless to say is the best TA (both background and teaching) in Econ department. Since lectures already giving detailed explanation, I didn't attend tutorials. But it should be good as well.",

Participation (5%)<br />This one is not the ordinary participation, you don't have to answer questions or attend lectures. If you are well-behaved in lectures, you scored full points.<br />The reason that Prof. Au set this participation is some students make a commitment with him but didn't show up eventually. Just act as an Incentives :D<br /><br />2. Problem sets (15%)<br />Grade by effort. Best 4 out of 5.<br /><br />3. Midterm Test (25%)<br />4. Final Exam (55%)<br />Both midterm and final is quite similar to problem sets. Open books and Notes (hardcopies only). The time is barely enough for each part.<br />TA Dominic is lenient in grading the questions. If you get the correct answer, you can still get full marks even missing some steps. Partial marks will be given if you show some meaningful steps.<br /><br />Also, Prof. Au gave us past-paper for practicing (the real past paper last year) which the questions format are similar to the exams this year. He also always remind us the correct strategies to achieve higher marks during exams. Like he is really hoping we can all perform well. Very nice of him.<br /><br />---Update---<br />Participation: should be full<br />Problem set: 40/40<br />Midterm: 114/120 (Mean: 82, SD:15.6, High: 114)<br />Final: 131/150 (Mean: 106.1, SD not released, High: 132)<br />Grade: A+",

I only get a B in ECON2103 and still manage to get a decent mark in midterm (I got the highest in class). You can treat this course as a completely new, real introduction to microeconomics.<br /><br />呢個就係我個人感受，我覺得係呢個course先係真正學緊Microeconomics。2103有太多嘅Details因為數學嘅問題，Instructor通常都會Skip左好多解釋，或者係有好多嘅Assumption係度搞到好多野都好唔清𥇦（我唔知道2113個情況）。所以如果真係對Econ有興趣嘅同學就算係Intro course表現唔好，可以睇一睇Intermediate level嘅Textbook睇下自己係咪真係有興趣，我都幾慶幸最後無因為2103表現比較差而無㨂到Econ。",

His organization is clear for each topic, and sometimes he uses interesting examples to facilitate understanding. It is easy to follow his pace.

I am NOT responsible for your decision.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed that the final score is not released. Still, I get an A+ in this course, given my problem sets are all full (indeed, the means are over 95%) and my midterm is somewhere between the UQ and the Highest. I personally think I did better in the final. I am quite satisfied with the letter grade.<br /><br />Some tips for exams: The exams are VERY similar to problem sets. The midterm exam is quite time-constrained, so don't spend so much time on the proofs. The final exam is more relaxing, but be prepared that (for only 1-2 questions) you might not even know what the question is asking about.",
            "comment_workload": "Personally I think it is fair for a 4-credit course. There are 8 problem sets in total, each taking 1-2 hours. In addition, several past papers are released before the exams, so it takes some time to finish the past papers. I would say understanding the contents covered by the lectures is much more important rather than merely finishing the problem sets and past papers. Perhaps some background in mathematics is helpful in this course.",
