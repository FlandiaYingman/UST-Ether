The Prof. is professional, but content always be side-tracked. [Sometimes he likes to talk about using CEPT replace primary settling. But this method will somehow affect the BOD content and result in poor biological treatment. ] <br /><br />you can consider this course to be an extended version of CIVL3420, but more complicated. (To be honest, much much complicated). you are expected to learn:<br />1) biological modeling (course content of CIEM 5420)<br />2) Life cycle analysis <br />3) innovative technology - anammox (course content from CIEM 5480)<br />4) water reuse (course content from CIEM 5480)<br /><br />um.... at least I have tried to sit these 2 classes in my year 3 period, so I think this course is acceptable. But some of my friends (who are Msc), they are somehow confused.",

(but your design need those)<br />I have to self-search the calculation of MBBR and MBR to do the project. my groupmate needs to learn how to do anaerobic digester design.<br /><br />Better self-learn. Strongly suggested to read this book:<br />&quot;Biological Wastewater treatment&quot; __ IWA.<br />If you can understand this book, then you will be fine. But if not, go and ask TA/ attend CIEM 5420/5480.",

Very complicated. you need to calculate:<br /><br />1) preliminary treatment (grit/screen)<br />2) primary treatment (laminar/&nbsp;&nbsp;salsnas filter)<br />3) secondary treatment (MBBR/MBR/AGS/Activated sludge)<br />4) Disinfection <br />5) water reuse (if needed)<br />6) sludge and side stream treatment (anammox + digestor)<br /><br />Please, check the EPD government policy and effluent standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;some area will hope to do water reuse for toilet flushing, but some wont. BTW, be well prepared with your presentation, the prof. will be very harsh when looking at your design. (Some PG student being challenged and the prof. claimed he is disappointed and cannot see any effort in their work.)",

If you have been intern in EPD, DSD or consultant in water group: ask them and learn about wastewater treatment.",
