You can definitely learn something from it, irrespective of your background in AI :D<br /><br />I'd give an A if there's some indication of the depth of each seminar. Some are targeted at laymen whereas some go very deep - very enriching but students with less background knowledge will find it very hard to follow.",

That's much lighter than ENGG2010!<br /><br />Jot some keywords during the seminar and the quizzes are no-brainers! You can also have your attentive friend do it for you.<br /><br />If you're in T2 (the video recording section), you can also choose to watch the recordings online - in RVC (meh) quality - just remember to submit a 500-word essay for each seminar for your attendance to count.",
