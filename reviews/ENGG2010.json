        "description": "This course is designed for non-freshman students in the School of Engineering to promote the awareness of the role of engineers and the impact of engineering in the society. As a continuation of ENGG 1010, students are required to attend a few seminars from a series of seminars offered by the school each year. The seminars cover areas including the ethical and environmental responsibilities as an engineer, the importance and the considerations of safety and health related issues in engineering designs and solutions, and in general the impact of engineering to the society. This course helps to provide the needed components for meeting the accreditation requirement and also helps to broaden the students' horizon in different engineering disciplines. For SENG students not in their first year of study only. Graded P or F. May be graded PP.",

There may be a scheduled seminar timetable confirmed in November!!!!! Hence, you should check your HKUST email to see whether the talk will be finalised. There are some reminders for each seminar on or before a day of its scheduled time. <br /><br />Brief summary for each seminar:<br />After a week of each seminar, you must hand in the essay;<br />During the two weeks after the deadline, TAs normally should be marking your essay;<br />After two weeks of the seminar, the results will be posted on Turnitin;<br />After three weeks of the seminar, the results will be posted on E-advising system.

You should participate in at least 3 different categories as listed above. <br /><br />I personally suggest you attend all in one semester, preventing forgotfulness and time conflict, i.e. you will pass within one semester if you do so. <br /><br />AND the lecture hall can be possibly full, and you should line up at least before 10 mins after the scheduled time of the talk!<br /><br />Otherwise, PP (permit to proceed) will be given to you!",

Some of my friends were told to rewrite! Be aware of the marking scheme!!!<br /><br />After rewriting, you have only ONE week to object!<br /><br />If you use an hour to write the best, no need to concern about anything :) Just honest saying!",

You must attend at least 1 seminar or workshop in Year 2, or else you fail.<br /><br />Speaking of content, while some seminars are pure bragging/water blowing, the content of other seminars or workshops does give you an insight of how real-life engineering world actually runs (like, how to conduct workplace safety measures in a factory or construction site, etc.).Though, they can be hampered by the course's variable teaching quality.",

Quota can run out as fast as 15 to 30 minutes. You are advised to set notification ON on you Canvas mobile phone app to get dated notice for registration.<br />*Bring your student ID, as your student ID will be scanned for attendance record.<br />*The seminars/workshops are held from 1800 to 1920. For non-resident students, consider having your dinner before the seminars/workshops, or have dinner out of the campus: canteens providing dinner after 1900 are limited.<br /><br />As per others said, the teaching quality differs for different seminars/workshops. Instructors of ENGG2010 come from different background, including professors in the HKUST (for ENV workshops), alumni, other guest speakers and ICAC community outreach officials.<br /><br />Among these instructors, I'll make a honorable mention for Professor Sauerwein responsible for ENV workshops. Apart from clear and fluent English (as native English speaker), her examples and course material used are memorable: for example she used people's perception of environmental impacts of packaging versus the actual environmental impacts. She also tried to make her workshops interactive and interesting by utilizing online chat system and PRS system, though the chat quickly fell into chaos after people used it for private chat.<br /><br />Learning motivation is low in these courses (as one can expect for P/F courses): most students tend to use the seminars/workshops to do their homework, revise, or simply get a good nap, though you are strongly recommended to take simple notes/photograph the PPT/screenshot the Zoom meeting (for online seminar) to prepare for the essays/quizzes.<br /><br />Speaking of TAs, while previously some reported that TAs are inefficient in marking our works, the TAs are more punctual in this semester. All of my essays are marked and have grades released within the promised 2 weeks, though quizzes seems to take a longer time to mark.",
            "comment_grading": "ENGG2010 adopts a pass/fail system.<br />*If you fulfill all course requirement, you pass.<br />*Or else you are given permit to proceed.<br />*For non-attendance within Year 2 or failure of requirement at the end of Year 3, you fail.<br /><br />From the high mean announced, it seems that a number of the students get full mark for the essays and quizzes, especially when considering the announced mean also include those who didn't register for the seminars/workshops.",
            "comment_workload": "After each seminar, you are required to submit a piece of reflection essay of 200 to 300 words within 1 week, though you can and may want to write more to show your understanding and prevent unnoticed off-topic part. As the essay is for reflection, writing too much on what you've learned would land you a very low mark (probably 0-1/5). Though from my experience, as long as you don't write nonsensical or plagiarized essay, you should be getting full marks for the essays.<br /><br />Workshops use quizzes instead: you need to complete an open-ended quiz with 2 questions after the workshop, in which they focus on specific course materials taught in the workshop (eg. How to conduct life-cycle assessment?): water-blowing of general course content is futile in such case.",
