Lots of things to remember and every tiny bit of information (including the Latin scientific names of fruit flies - &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, and brine shrimps - &quot;Artemia salina&quot;, how there are cultured in the medium, their growth and metamorphosis, how a nerve impulse is generated and propagated and all those sodium and potassium channel thingy, and also the calculation chi-square I've just mentioned) will be asked in the final exams.<br /><br />There are no so-called &quot;main points&quot; in his PowerPoint - EVERY little word, schematic diagram, and picture will be asked in the exam.

For those who still naively think it's a P/F course and don't really work hard for the final exam, good luck!!! Btw I needa thank those people so much coz I'm gonna have a chance to strive for a better grade. Yay~ But it's awful enough to have an A+ to F grading for a 1-credit course - it does nothing but gives a lot of stress and tension. Okay, I understand that... It's University of Stress and Tension anyway, accept it or not. Phew ~ T.T<br /><br />Another thing is that once you miss one lab session without any reason, you'll immediately be failed, unlike in previous years one lab session can be missed without any penalty. It's become much harsher than before.<br /><br />Final Exam:<br />Mean: 43.3/91<br />SD: 12.7<br /><br />But my final grade was not as bad as I thought. Some students obviously did not treat this exam seriously... I got 60/91 (1.3 SD above mean) in final.<br /><br />💯 Grade: A-",

TAs are really really nice!!!But be careful that some changes in the conc of chemicals will only be announced during briefing.<br /><br />There is some video recording and displaying on what is occurring on the briefing stage. This is one of the good point about this course. But again, the filming skills is ...... hard to explain...... Also, one of the accents of the technician who is sometimes responsible for demonstration is quite heavy and it is hard to catch what he is saying. <br /><br />Reason why I finally give B is that professor and all the technicians and TAs are really helpful!!!

Lab reports (Esp lab reports 2&amp;3 which are take-home assignment. Everytime I handed in the lab report, I was afraid that I missed any important points and kept adding staff onto the reports)<br />2. Final exams (I only study lab manual and ppt one afternoon and night before start of the exam)<br />I rmb that in the exam, no scientific name of flies is asked. But in MCs, conc of TAE (knowing how to find it is ok when going through ppt) and name of TAE was asked. I remember only 1 questions in lab procedures was asked.",

It was MC questions and fill-in-the-blanks questions. The grammar was kinda bad so I was very confused, especially in the fill-in-the-blanks part. It was super unpredictable. They ask weird questions like the scientific name of the animal you experimented on and the amount of substance you used during experiments.

I think its kinda dumb that they ask that though.<br /><br />I cannot stress how important you have to study the ppt. Study every detail because you have no idea what they're going to ask since they ask the useless info as well. Truly the most disastrous final Ive ever sat for. Im still mad.",

It's said to supplement LIFS1902, but the only part interesting reallyt is the rat dissection. And oh it's 2 people sharing a rat, so it's less fun than you'd have liked of course. The only thing useful about enzymatic assay is that you gotta know how to operate a pipetteman, which honestly a third grader can learn in 2 minutes. DNA gel electrophoresis -- concept is good since it's routinely used in research labs too, but the techniques taught are just wrong (e.g. NEVER EVER add DNA samples above the wells -- add them into the friggin wells). Oh and the resulting UV-exposed photo usually doesn't show good results, sometimes because of poor exposure by the technicians (you'll know after one or two times at research labs). Genetics is kind of boring, and scary for those who fear arthropods. Toxicity analysis is kind of brutal too, just watching those little creatures suffocating and dying in the toxic solutions.<br />What's worse, you wait and wait and wait and chat and chat and chat until you've got nothing more to chat about and the wall starts to become really interesting.",
            "comment_teaching": "Boring. Boring. Boring. It's literally just a reiteration of what's been covered in LIFS1902, with a bit more of experimental techniques perhaps. Bobby's not exactly the funniest instructor, but considering his hilarious pronunciations he fares well in that department. Plus, you've got a huge crowd gathered around the instructor's bench, which makes it extremely difficult to hear him clearly, let alone seeing what he does / demonstrates, if you're sitting at the back.",
            "comment_grading": "Pass or fail. Final is pretty damn hard actually, e.g. asking you what buffer (and the concentration too) you'd use in DNA gel. But, again, since it's just pass or fail, take it easy.",
