Most are just common sense stuff (except the chapter talking about coral and guest lecture). YES!! Guest lecture you have to study and memorize!

Her lectures are relaxing and interesting but the intensity is tooooo high!! Many many names to memorize, including examples!! And many things about those protists and invertebrates are just nonlogical!! What you need to do is just rote learning.
