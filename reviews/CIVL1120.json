        "description": "This course intends to facilitate studentâ€™s exploration in earthquake engineering through hands-on experiments. Students are grouped to design and build scaled building models using wood, glue, strings and rubber bands, which are loaded and tested on a shake table under simulated earthquake ground motion. Through the design, build and test process, students can observe the effect of different design variables and details on the test result. Students are then guided to interpret the observations, identify possible issues, explore relevant knowledge, and propose viable options for improvement. Students need to reflect what they have learned on a revised building model and contest other groups in a final competition.",

            "comment_grading": "VERY VERY POOR. Year 1 students please do not take in this course. The grade is mainly comprised of two part. One is the two seminar discussion conducted in class and the other is the result of your model building. This course was filled with Year 4 civil Students which they will use their knowledge and experience to beat you. And some of them even have competition experience so it is very difficult to excel in this course. For me, i have one seminar discussion marks below mean while other is above average. Finally i get a C+ which is totally ridiculous considering i have put a lot of efforts in this course.",
