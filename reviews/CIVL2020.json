            "comment_content": "This course has extended and acorss over two years (2020-2022) due to the changing pandemic situation and teaching arrangement of PolyU IC. It is not sure whether students from later cohort follow the same schedule and the teaching content may vary. <br /><br />Spring 2020 BIM (9 weeks during normal course hours)<br /><br />This part was delivered by Prof Jack Cheng and Ir Ng. Content ranging from basic civil engineering drawings using software including Autodesk Civil 3D, Revit, Navis-work and Dynamo. Lectures introduced both the concepts and recent technological advancement in construction computerization with the aid of BIM.&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructors demonstrated the assignments step by step, so just followed the instructions and you will be fine submitting the work. <br /><br />Please noted that Autodesk Student Version fail to support MacBook, so you better prepare a Windows computer with larger RAM to run the software. <br /><br />Summer 2020 Surveying <br />This part is over-simplified due to the pandemic. Thomas failed to arrange face to face session for students to operate the surveying tools to conduct measurement at campus. Therefore, he gave an introductory lecture covering the basic concepts and provided the necessary data for completing the graded quiz. This part only took me half an hour to complete, given the quiz asked questions comprehensively from the slides and some simple calculations. 60 points is the passing mark for this module. <br /><br />Winter 2020-21 (7 day training and lecture at PolyU IC)<br />(From 0830-around 1630 with usually one and a half hour lunch)<br /><br />This module was delayed for entire year. It was supposed to have the workshop in Jan 2020, then postponed to Summer 2020, then again postponed to Dec-Jan 2020-21. <br /><br />It consisted of 4 topics, from formwork, scaffolding, concrete and brickwork. Each part includes a lecture covering the necessary theories and applications, and a full day practical workshop with around 20 students. The lectures were conducted online with some non-graded quizzes to check students' attendance. The practical workshop provided hands on experience to work on different construction procedures, which may consume heavily your physical strength and require good workmanship. <br /><br />Remember to bring your safety shoe. You can purchase any safety shoe in Mong Kok or Sham Shui Po given there are lots of options.<br /><br />At the end of each workshop, a MC test (30%) and a module report (70%) is required to assess students performance. <br /><br />Construction Safety Training (Green Card)<br />What I heard from my peers is that the whole day training keeps delaying. If you have a very urgent reason to get a Green Card to work at sites/ internship, better pay and attend the class outside (cost only ~$200 and you immediately get the Green card once passed the MC test). UST keeps delaying the module even students are required to take compulsory internship in summer.<br /><br />Personally I received the Green Card in July 2020 for my internship, but it is better to get one as early as possible since the class openings vary due to the current work-from-home arrangements.",
            "comment_teaching": "Overall speaking, the teaching quality for all the instructors are satisfactory. <br /><br />The PolyU IC instructors are mostly friendly to demonstrate the work and give help if your group face any difficulties preparing the product. Everyone speak Cantonese so no worries if you don't understand those specific terminologies and procedures.<br /><br />Formwork and Brickwork are the most challenging tasks, cutting and mixing tool consume your energy heavily so better eat more during lunch. <br />Scaffolding is the simplest and I would say this is the fun part if you are not afraid of heights.",
            "comment_grading": "It is just a P/F course. <br />Submit all the work on time without making big mistakes then that's all. But the case in our cohort is special, it took me over two years to officially receive a Pass. (the course started since Feb 2020 and received a PASS in Mar 2022 for your information.)<br /><br />However, students should urge the department to arrange the Green Card Section for internship and confirm the release of course grade to avoid any delay towards your graduation.",
            "comment_workload": "Comparatively low workload since it is a practical course. The part conducted by Ir Ng took me just a bit more time due to the slow network and his way of delivery was sometimes too fast, he is an engineer not a regular teaching staff so please be patient if you can't follow in real time or you may prepare a dual monitor.<br /><br />The PolyU IC part required students to submit a 4-page module reports for each workshop, covering the outline, safety measures and technical content. Following the lecture notes and the actual work did in the workshop to work on the reports is not a big deal, easy to handle within an hour.<br /><br />Updates: After finishing the module technical report for each PolyU IC module, the Industrial Training Centre at UST will require you to complete another set of summary report (6-8 pages hand-write) to summarize the content of what you have learnt so far in PolyU IC. To make it simple, you can just copy and select some of the content you have previously written to complete the report. <br /><br />After completing the UST IC summary report and get all your modules done, then they will review your progress and award you a PASS.",

Winter, workshops: PolyU多數都幫得手，肯答問題，堂上亦會提考試重點。測量地底電纜嗰位除外，只有佢問你，你唔佢唔會答。有地方唔明一定要先問「組長」，「組長」都唔明就由佢透過「組長」轉達。會串人乜都唔識。<br /><br />3. Spring, Surveying: Hu, Wei Chung<br />上堂比較幽默，唔會一味講書；有時亦會因學生太眼瞓而早放。",

Winter: Safety Talk 5-6條 PRS,，<br />4次Workshops，每兩三日一個quiz (10 or 20條 MC, 40% pass)。<br />另加每次完咗workshop後一份4頁report (有template, 一星期後交)。好耐之後report會派返，要寫一份overall comment/feelings。6月中成份logbook (report*4 + overall comment) 交。<br /><br />3.Spring, Surveying: 2次lab report (一組交一份，email excel file 去TA)。第四次lecture就係Final, 16條MC。",

Winter, Workshops: lab report 要比較花心思.。重視長度，無論寫得幾好，長度唔夠/太多空位即fail。可畫圖, 但唔可以太大。 另外某位professor要求多多之餘，仲要喺report擦鞋/寫佢嗰範有幾重要之類，要十分小心。<br /><br />3. Spring, Surveying:&nbsp;&nbsp;2次lab report只需其中一人send畀TA。要喺excel打matrix，剩睇notes唔落手試做可能會有困難。做做完lab臨走前記得要攞曬所有人嘅contact, 唔係就等畀人free ride。",

These are compulsory and you must attend ALL! For the workshops, you should be assigned into groups of 8-12 or subgroups of 4. The timetable for the workshops will be sent to you before few weeks. Around 20 students taken in one classroom together! It is recommended that you buy/bring your safety shoes during workshops due to its necessity, while some students could borrow the shoes from HKPOLYU (But not guaranteed).<br /><br />1. Brickwork: dry &amp; wet mixed cement mortar &amp; cement paste by hand、L-shaped brick wall, plastering (hard part) (1st day), mosaic &amp; ceramic tiling (2nd day) <br />2. Scaffolding (1 day only): erecting &amp; dismantling aluminium mobile tower, plane frame scaffolds<br />3. Site formation: mostly lecturing for two days, which involves a lot of things we (may) have learnt, e.g. waves, statics, mechanics of materials, soil mechanics, geology; five experiments with worksheets (1st day), very boring scanning the ground cables zzzzzzzz.. (2nd day). <br />4. Formwork: make a wooden box, planning and sketching 1:1 falsework (1st day), make the falsework and the formwork (will be used later in concrete part) (2nd day)<br />5. Structural concrete: calculate and weighing the large amount of materials needed (you will be told in the workshops, and also the quantities depend on your formwork size!), mixing concrete (by tilting drum mixer), preparation for cube compression test (1st day), mixing less amount of materials by hand, slump test, cube compression test, steel cutting, bending in square form; fixing steel and the whole structures of the drawing given (hard part, and confusing!) (2nd day)<br /><br />Year 2 Spring/Summer HKUST Modules: <br /><br />For nominal lectures in Spring semester:<br />BIM (Revit, Navisworks, Dynamo...)/AutoCAD 3D Metric (10 weeks): Taught by Jack Cheng &amp; Ir Ng<br />Land Surveying (3 Weeks, but in fact you only need to attend the 3 assigned days within lecture time): Taught by Thomas Hu, while the lab part requires 4-5 students grouped to survey at the Sundial of HKUST!<br /><br />Year 2 Spring/Summer Safety Training: (It depends on which group you are assigned to, while you can take this Green Card Safety Training much earlier on campus or pay outside campus). After passing the course (try displacing an object with correct postures, understand safety helmet, safety belt..., finally examine 20MCs), you can take a easy but never be late more than 15 minutes! <br />VERY IMPORTANT: Some students are required to leave by the office when they are late by more than 30 minutes. And the weather is amber rainstorm outside. Therefore, the safety officer who gives the presentation WILL clearly and strictly follow the rule from Labour Department!<br /><br />By the way, as the prove of the BIM 30-hour training in this course, you can choose to pay $50 for the hardcopy certificate from Ir NG, and you may write it on your CV! I see no reason to not paying for that money!",
            "comment_teaching": "This &quot;Teaching&quot; Review part only concerns the Industrial Training in HKPOLYU (Winter semester):<br /><br />For the workshop time, for the original plan, it lasts from 8:30 to 17:30, however, for MOST of the workshops, they ended before 16:45, and one of the workshops finished at 15:40! Hence, it depends on your cooperation and the tutors (for site formation part, the tutor finished after 17:00 or 17:15 even though the workshop should have ended)<br /><br />For the punctuality, some students come back at 9:20, i.e. around 1 hours after original plan, they still can get their signature, as the signature is the most important parts in the workshops! However, you are suggested to try your best come back before 9am...<br /><br />There are no foreigners/mainland students in my sessions, hence the tutors speak Cantonese directly (except for the site formation part, whose tutor speaks more English than Cantonese.) <br /><br />Most tutors (except scaffolding &amp; concrete) will give you a break during teaching, and this is very good for the tiring, early (8:30) lessons! It is very important as many students can sleep more and be able to work later!<br /><br />Most tutors give tips for quizzes (except site formation), they claimed that none of the students failed because of quizzes. They also allowed quiet chatting with classmates! Hence, they are easy-going! For the teaching part, site formation tutor loved saying: HKUST students are very humble (it means you know only a little concept…Maybe he thinks everyone has taken mechanics of materials (CIVL2120))…<br /><br />All tutors are very helpful and fast paced! <br />Suggestions: do everything fast and end fast (except site formation)!<br /><br />For the schedule of the 1st day of each module (similar), intro (30 minutes, only for your 1st lesson)-teaching (0.5-1.5 hours)-working (usually stop at 12:00, but for concrete part, the tutor stopped at 11:20)-lunch (until 13:30)-teaching (0.5-1.5 hours)-working-end.<br /><br />For the schedule of the 2nd day of each module (similar, except scaffolding), teaching (0.5-1.5 hours)-working (usually stop at 12:00, but for concrete part, even 2nd&nbsp;&nbsp;day, the tutor also stopped at 11:20)-lunch (until 13:30)-teaching (0.5-1.5 hours)-working (1-2 hours)-quiz (for site formation, the questions are quite hard due to the lengthy ppt...; for concrete, scaffolding &amp; formwork parts, there are only 10 questions, while other modules should have 20 questions!).",
            "comment_grading": "Only Pass or Fail. 4 modules mentioned in the &quot;Content&quot; MUST ALL PASS! <br /><br />P.S. You will receive PP for spring semester, since you still need to write a full report (reflection, but seems more like an essay) for the industrial training before year 3 fall!<br /><br />For the winter safety training &amp; industrial training:<br /><br />Safety talk (The speaker said some students failed the questions, and they had to retake (I am not sure whether it is real…))<br />For the following, you may have different time sequences for the workshops! Remember, better bring your safety shoes. Most of them (except formwork) will require safety helmet that is given to you, I suggest you request for a (safety) mask for some modules! <br /><br />Attendance (MUST), Reports (70%), Quiz (30%):<br />For the attendance problem (despite being sick or any reason), some attend very late and they have to take another half-day of the same module. If you miss the whole day, you have to attend any day of the same module. Due to the necessity of full attendance, if you are very unlucky, you may have to attend the NEXT year industrial training for the missing module and rewrite the report!",
            "comment_workload": "Winter industrial training part:<br />I give the workload &quot;C&quot; because of its early time lesson.<br />I will update the grading for spring semester later!<br /><br />Every week after the workshop module, one 4-page report (with template) should be submitted to U103 in HKPOLYU (NOT HKUST)! They count the spacing and the words, hence filling most of the space is required (you may use drawing/photos, but not too much!)<br /><br />For the logbook, you are required to submit on or before 15-9-2019. More details regarding to it will be updated later!<br /><br />One of the tutors (concrete) is strict/harsh regarding to writing report. He said that he would give an “A” for those answering most of the questions in the template (in the intro part, i.e. 1st day). But some of students fill in all the reports and he give “C” due to contents written not broad enough (e.g. only write concrete and missing reinforcement), he said he would have given “F” for those students if he is really strict. For other modules, the content is less important, just fill in all the lines with words and photos.<br /><br />For the spring HKUST Modules (Drawing &amp; Surveying):<br />We have normal timetable &amp; it is necessary to attend every tutorial (since there will be in-class quizzes)<br />We have to attend the tutorials every Tuesday &amp; Thursday! Hence, it is just like a 2-3 credit course.",
