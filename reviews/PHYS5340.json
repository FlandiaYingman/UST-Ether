        "description": "Introduction to theoretical methods for quantum many-body systems. Perturbative methods, like Green's functions and diagrammatics, will be introduced. Topics in response theory and quantum magnetism will be covered. More modern, entanglement-based approaches, like tensor networks, will also be discussed.",
