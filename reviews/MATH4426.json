R and its package for survival analysis will be used in the course. But don't expect you can learn R deeply in the course. <br /><br />Similar to many other courses in Math Department, the course lacks of real-life application. The data used are not real-life data so they cannot give you any inspiration.<br /><br />Most of the exam questions are computation. If you can understand how to use the equations, you can get a good result the exam.",

Computation and plotting graphs by using R<br /><br />Both exams are open-book so you do not need to memorize the equations but you need to know how to use them.",

In this semester, there are only 15 people join this course and I don't know why.<br /><br />Content:<br />Definitions you have to know: <br />1. Censored data and Uncensored data<br />2. Survival Probability and Hazard Rate<br />3. KM Estimation and NA Estimation<br />4. Parametric Distribution and Non-parametric Distribution<br />5. Testing: MME, MLE, ...<br />6. Grouped data and or ungrouped data<br />7. Models'<br /><br />Actually, there are totally eight chapters and the difficulty is increasing.",

HW (20%), Midterm (30%), Final Exam (50%)<br />B. HW(20%), Midterm (0%), Final Exam (80%)<br /><br />So, if once you cannot get a good result in midterm, you can work hard in the final.<br /><br />Graded by curve so good luck.",
