Did all the homeworks but didn't get good grades in them (dk if it matters), scored 94/100 in midterm (mean 58) and 95/100 in final (mean 48) and got A+ in the end. <br />One thing to note is that there were around 10 people scoring more than 95 in midterm despite the low mean, so I think the grading is very good.",
