            "comment_content": "Note that the syllabus is changed this year. In a nutshell, the mathematical stuff is no longer required, but there will be more technical stuff contextually detailed.<br /><br />The course contents are separately taught by four professors, mainly Ng Yee Fai and Lin Nian. To be personal, the syllabus is broad, but without systematic organization. (And I think many things in this course are not Year-1 level at all. Although the professors are just attempting to give a brief account on those things, they are still hard to comprehend.)<br /><br />Here is basically what we have to learn in each chapter. The level of difficulty of each chapter (from my point of view) for a physics beginner is also indicated.<br /><br />Ng Yee Fai part:<br />1. Energy ⭐⭐⭐<br />- Mechanical Energy (Potential Energy, Kinetic Energy, Work-Energy Theorem)<br />- Conservation of Energy<br />- Sources of Energy (Solar, Wind, Tidal, Geothermal, Hydrogen, Plasma)<br />- Nuclear Power (Fission, Fusion, Nuclear Reactors, Mass-Energy Equivalence)<br /><br />This chapter is a bit difficult when it comes to plasma and nuclear power, which constitute around half of the chapter.<br /><br />2. Daily Applications (A) ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Thermodynamics<br />Application 1: Heat Engine (e.g. Internal Combustion Engine)<br />Application 2: Heat Pumps (e.g. Refrigerator and Air-con)<br /><br />- Electromagnetism<br />。Electric charge (Applications: Photocopiers, laser printers, 3d printers)<br />。Capacitors (Applications: RAM, Touch Screens, Supercapacitor bus)<br />。Electromagnetic Induction (Applications: Transformers, Inductive Charging, Electric Guitar, Motors, Generators, Hybrid Automobiles, Maglev)<br /><br />As a physics beginner, I took several days to at least understand what all the text in the slides of this chapter is talking about. Not easy at all.<br /><br />3. Daily Applications (B) ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Mechanics<br />。Acceleration (Application: MEMS)<br />。Oscillation (Application: Electronic Clocks)<br /><br />- Optics<br />。Polarization (Application: 3D-Viewing, LCD)<br /><br />- Modern Physics<br />。Photoelectric effect (Application: CCD)<br />。Molecules and Condensed Matters (Application: LED, OLED)<br />。Atoms <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Laser (Application: Holography)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Atomic clocks (Application: GPS)<br /><br />Same as the previous chapter, I took many efforts to understand what the fuck is going on.<br /><br />4. Medical Applications⭐⭐⭐<br />- Waves<br />。Sound waves (Application: Ultrasound Imaging)<br /><br />- Optics<br />。Fiber optics (Application: Endoscopy)<br /><br />- Modern Physics<br />。Laser (Application: LASIK, PRK)<br />。X-ray (Application: X-ray Imaging, CAT)<br />。Pair Annihilation (Application: PET)<br />。NMR (Application: MRI)<br /><br />As time passed by, the chapters of Ng Yee Fai part became easier. For this chapter, X-ray, pair annihilation and NMR are the more difficult parts, comprising a large portion of the chapter. But at least, way easier to understand compared to daily applications!<br /><br />5. Disasters⭐⭐⭐<br />- Stellar Impact (e.g. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, the Cretaceous extinction, The Chelyabinsk Asteroid, The Yunnan Fireball, A/2017 U1)<br /><br />- Earthquake (Seismic waves, Earth's internal layers, earthquake causes, magnitude scales)<br /><br />- Nuclear weapons<br />。Atomic bombs (Little Boy, The Gadget, Fat Man)<br />。Hydrogen Bomb (Fusion Bomb)<br />。Aftermath of nuclear explosions<br /><br />- Nuclear Reactor Accidents (The Three Mile Island Accident, The Chernobyl Accident, The Fukushima Accident)<br /><br />Largely related to the chapter of Energy (the first chapter listed). The earthquake and nuclear weapon parts are relatively difficult, composing a large part of this chapter.<br /><br />6. Environmental Issues ⭐⭐<br />a. Solar Radiation<br />b. Greenhouse Effect<br />c. The Keeling Curve<br />d. Global Warming<br />e. Carbon footprint<br /><br />The easiest chapter, throughout the WHOLE COURSE, because they are mainly senior level Geography stuff, with less details.<br /><br />Each chapter has a slide of around 80-100 pages. Some of the pages are just video, pictures and demonstrations, but most of them will be wordy contextual details.<br /><br />Lin Nian part:<br />1. Introduction⭐<br />Shit intro.<br /><br />2. New Material and Physics ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /><br />Current Materials<br />- Silicon<br />(Application: PN-junction diode, PNP-junction transistor)<br />- Carbon (Graphite and Graphene)<br />(Application: Flexible display, graphene nanoribbons, carbon nanotube)<br /><br />Future Materials<br />- Metamaterials (Invisible cloaking, negative refractive index)<br />- Quantum materials (Quantum hall effect)<br /><br />Supplement: Superconductors<br /><br />3. Microscopy and Nanotechnology⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /><br />Microscopy<br />- History<br />- Properties of light (EM wave, diffraction)<br />- X-ray crystallography <br />- Double-slit experiment<br />- Scanning Electron Microscopy<br />- Transmission Electron Microscopy<br />- Quantum tunneling effects (Application: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy)<br />- Atomic force microscopy<br /><br />Nanotech<br />- Definition<br />- Damascus<br />- Properties at nanometer scale (subatomic scale)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Gold<br />- Quantum confinement<br />- Application: sunscreens<br />- Quantum Dot displays<br />- Nano-fabrication (Lithography: E-beam, Focused Ion beam, Molecular beam epitaxy)<br /><br />4. Information Technology and Physics ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Magnetic data storage<br />。Magnetism (Spin, Curie Temperature, Magnetic domains, etc.)<br />。Data Storage (GMR, TMR, MTJ)<br /><br />- Quantum computer<br />。Uncertainty Principle<br />。Particle and Wave Duality<br />。Superposition<br />。Qubit<br />。Advantages of quantum computer<br /><br />- Quantum communication<br />。quantum entanglement<br /><br />5. Future and Unsolved Problems⭐<br />Quantum gravity, particle masses, quantum measurement, turbulence, dark energy, dark matter, complexity, matter-antimatter asymmetry, friction, arrow of time<br /><br />Just some brief introduction to the above unsolved problems and ending of the course.<br /><br />I had many question marks on my head whenever I took a seat in Lin Nian's lecture. I could not even understand his notes. Of course they are more concise than Ng Yee Fai's, but the notes gave no explanation (just some random combinations of description, pictures and mathematical equations).<br /><br />&quot;Ahhhhhh..... Mathematics is intrinsically fucking beautiful......&quot;<br /><br />====GUEST LECTURES====<br /><br />Liu Tao: Elementary Particles and Standard Model<br />?????????????????????????????????????????????<br /><br />Wang Yi: Universe and Cosmology<br />I can say I know what is going on, but I cannot say so either.......<br /><br />Two documentaries:<br />- The Big Bang Machine<br />- Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking<br /><br />Long documentaries. I think I do not really love physics (or science). I found the documentaries uninteresting, but sure, way more understandable than the NOTES of the guest lectures.",
            "comment_teaching": "I don't know why, but I just couldn't help sleeping in the lectures. The lectures, objectively speaking, are not really boring. Yeah, I still fell asleep during the lectures, very often.<br /><br />I also found myself unable to follow what the professors were teaching. But for Ng Yee Fai, I could still drop down some notes and then try to understand afterwards. While for Lin Nian, well, I couldn't find any main points from his speaking.<br /><br />(Oh, I coincidentally discovered that Lin Nian is / was in charge of PHYS 1314 and the course reviews there have more comments about him, the first two of which are indeed accurate..)<br /><br />Tutorial: Ng Ka Long<br />Pure wastage of time. But you still have to attend the tutorial, because it counts towards your final grade. I should have swapped to other sessions.",
            "comment_grading": "30% Tutorial Attendance<br /><br />70% Final Exam<br />- 75 MC questions in 3 hours<br /><br />The questions are just asking what the notes and tutorial questions are telling you, but you definitely cannot answer if you don't do the revision. (基本上就系，識就識，唔識就唔識。有溫同無溫嘅分別。)<br /><br />Most people could finish the paper within 45 minutes (or even 30). Maybe the professors should have asked 200 questions, say.<br /><br />No statistics are provided. The grading should be not bad (Ng Yee Fai said that he normally would give out B+).",
            "comment_workload": "As a guy who didn't take DSE physics before, it is a strenuous task to understand and REMEMBER the stuff on the notes. This requires constant efforts throughout the semester.<br /><br />But if you are not intended to do well in this course, then the workload is very light, because you can just go for tutorial and final exam. And this column should be an 'A' for you.",

He is a patient and friendly professor who is willing to explain the concepts to you one by one. <br />He likes to show students YouTube videos and demos to demonstrate Physics concepts. And I think they do help as the YouTube videos generally summarized all the things covered in the lesson.<br />Although Prof. Lin's accent is a little bit strong, you will get used to it easily. And tbh, you can understand him if you follow him closely. <br /><br />I also did attend a few of Prof. Li's lessons for reference. He is very good at explaining the concepts and he would elaborate much more. He will go through much more of the basic Physics concepts which I think it's very useful in helping people without a Physics background to understand. <br />He's also nice and friendly.<br /><br />In summary, both professors are awesome. If you want to have a better understanding of the core concepts, go for Prof. Li. If you just want to understand the facts, go for Prof. Lin.",

Some MCs are covered in tutorials <br /> <br />If you want a nice grade, be a good student. Attend all lectures and tutorials and REVISE. <br /><br />Since I really suck at Physics, I will revise the lecture materials after taught.

Like don't leave them aside or else you will be in HUGE trouble(especially you're bad in PHY).<br /> <br />Since the materials provided in the lectures are really brief and the profs won't dwell into the details and core concepts, sometimes it's quite difficult to understand the lectures. <br /><br />Have faith in yourself, hard work pays off!",

Before the next lesson, try to understand all the concepts of physics theory.

Open notes, open discussion, open Google. So scoring high in this shall not be a problem. One of the worst tutorial will not be counted.<br />3. Final Exam (60%)<br />- This year there is in total 90 MC to be done in 90 mins<br />- Most of the MC are just factual recall, do not involve in any maths.<br />- around 30 MC are from the IPRS questions, tutorials and sample exam provided to you.

Then, the rest are more or less related to memorization of the details.<br /><br />I would say if you have any kind of physics background or know some stories about the advancement of physics(ex. Einstein, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, etc) it would be helpful especially for understanding &quot;information technology and physics&quot; and &quot;various daily applications&quot; part. <br /><br />However, if you don't know a lot about physics that's okay you can catch up it's not that hard.",

He will definitely answer your questions.",

After about half an hour in the first lesson, I know that I must swap to any other lecturers. So, I was taught by NG for the rest of the lessons.<br /><br />NG managed a good interaction with his students in the chatroom. He will response some fun comments and make us less boring in the lessons.<br /><br />However, there are so many things we have to learn in this course and making the whole teaching become boring. There are only limited relations between lectures. The things you learn in the last lecture have no use in this lecture and so on. So, the professor always spend time to explain things in detail for every lecture. When the professor try to explain somethings, there are so many terms you never heard before and you don't know how it works. For the first time, you may feel confused. After several time, you will lose your mood to focus in the lecture.<br /><br />It maybe my problem only... So, at least, I think NG is better if you really want to learn some physics stuffs in this course as he can explain to you in detail.

Energy ⭐⭐⭐<br />- Mechanical Energy (Potential Energy, Kinetic Energy, Work-Energy Theorem)<br />- Conservation of Energy<br />- Sources of Energy (Solar, Wind, Tidal, Geothermal, Hydrogen, Plasma)<br />- Nuclear Power (Fission, Fusion, Nuclear Reactors, Mass-Energy Equivalence)<br /><br />This chapter is a bit difficult when it comes to plasma and nuclear power, which constitute around half of the chapter.<br /><br />2. Daily Applications (A) ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Thermodynamics<br />Application 1: Heat Engine (e.g. Internal Combustion Engine)<br />Application 2: Heat Pumps (e.g. Refrigerator and Air-con)<br /><br />- Electromagnetism<br />。Electric charge (Applications: Photocopiers, laser printers, 3d printers)<br />。Capacitors (Applications: RAM, Touch Screens, Supercapacitor bus)<br />。Electromagnetic Induction (Applications: Transformers, Inductive Charging, Electric Guitar, Motors, Generators, Hybrid Automobiles, Maglev)<br /><br />As a physics beginner, I took several days to at least understand what all the text in the slides of this chapter is talking about. Not easy at all.<br /><br />3. Daily Applications (B) ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Mechanics<br />。Acceleration (Application: MEMS)<br />。Oscillation (Application: Electronic Clocks)<br /><br />- Optics<br />。Polarization (Application: 3D-Viewing, LCD)<br /><br />- Modern Physics<br />。Photoelectric effect (Application: CCD)<br />。Molecules and Condensed Matters (Application: LED, OLED)<br />。Atoms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Laser (Application: Holography)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Atomic clocks (Application: GPS)<br /><br />Same as the previous chapter, I took many efforts to understand what the fuck is going on.<br /><br />4. Medical Applications⭐⭐⭐<br />- Waves<br />。Sound waves (Application: Ultrasound Imaging)<br /><br />- Optics<br />。Fiber optics (Application: Endoscopy)<br /><br />- Modern Physics<br />。Laser (Application: LASIK, PRK)<br />。X-ray (Application: X-ray Imaging, CAT)<br />。Pair Annihilation (Application: PET)<br />。NMR (Application: MRI)<br /><br />As time passed by, the chapters of Ng Yee Fai part became easier. For this chapter, X-ray, pair annihilation and NMR are the more difficult parts, comprising a large portion of the chapter. But at least, way easier to understand compared to daily applications!<br /><br />5. Disasters<br />- Stellar Impact (e.g. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, the Cretaceous extinction, The Chelyabinsk Asteroid, The Yunnan Fireball, A/2017 U1)<br /><br />- Earthquake (Seismic waves, Earth's internal layers, earthquake causes, magnitude scales)<br /><br />- Nuclear weapons<br />。Atomic bombs (Little Boy, The Gadget, Fat Man)<br />。Hydrogen Bomb (Fusion Bomb)<br />。Aftermath of nuclear explosions<br /><br />- Nuclear Reactor Accidents (The Three Mile Island Accident, The Chernobyl Accident, The Fukushima Accident)<br /><br />Largely related to the chapter of Energy (the first chapter listed). The earthquake and nuclear weapon parts are relatively difficult, composing a large part of this chapter.<br /><br />6. Environmental Issues <br />a. Solar Radiation<br />b. Greenhouse Effect<br />c. The Keeling Curve<br />d. Global Warming<br />e. Carbon footprint<br /><br />The easiest chapter, throughout the WHOLE COURSE, because they are mainly senior level Geography stuff, with less details.",

Since this is a introductory course, he had to skip many contents such as mathematical proofs and give everything a brief introduction, and he explained the concepts well, as these are often associated with concrete examples instead on abstract theories. I still found the materials somewhat interesting as the applications sounds familiar (such as GPS, computers, clocks, Air conditioners, power plants).",

However, since I remembered most of the key words, I still managed to marginally finished all the questions before the deadline.

He spoke in a more organised manner that was easy to follow and provided detailed and organised notes. TBH, with his notes I could skip all the lectures and still managed to prepare the final well enough. <br /><br />LIN has a bad English accent that was kinda hard to follow, his way of teaching was quite messy as well.

            "comment_content": "1. Energy ⭐⭐⭐<br />- Mechanical Energy (Potential Energy, Kinetic Energy, Work-Energy Theorem)<br />- Conservation of Energy<br />- Sources of Energy (Solar, Wind, Tidal, Geothermal, Hydrogen, Plasma)<br />- Nuclear Power (Fission, Fusion, Nuclear Reactors, Mass-Energy Equivalence)<br /><br />This chapter is a bit difficult when it comes to plasma and nuclear power, which constitute around half of the chapter.<br /><br />2. Daily Applications (A) ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Thermodynamics<br />Application 1: Heat Engine (e.g. Internal Combustion Engine)<br />Application 2: Heat Pumps (e.g. Refrigerator and Air-con)<br /><br />- Electromagnetism<br />。Electric charge (Applications: Photocopiers, laser printers, 3d printers)<br />。Capacitors (Applications: RAM, Touch Screens, Supercapacitor bus)<br />。Electromagnetic Induction (Applications: Transformers, Inductive Charging, Electric Guitar, Motors, Generators, Hybrid Automobiles, Maglev)<br /><br />As a physics beginner, I took several days to at least understand what all the text in the slides of this chapter is talking about. Not easy at all.<br /><br />3. Daily Applications (B) ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Mechanics<br />。Acceleration (Application: MEMS)<br />。Oscillation (Application: Electronic Clocks)<br /><br />- Optics<br />。Polarization (Application: 3D-Viewing, LCD)<br /><br />- Modern Physics<br />。Photoelectric effect (Application: CCD)<br />。Molecules and Condensed Matters (Application: LED, OLED)<br />。Atoms <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Laser (Application: Holography)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Atomic clocks (Application: GPS)<br /><br />Same as the previous chapter, I took many efforts to understand what the fuck is going on.<br /><br />4. Medical Applications⭐⭐⭐<br />- Waves<br />。Sound waves (Application: Ultrasound Imaging)<br /><br />- Optics<br />。Fiber optics (Application: Endoscopy)<br /><br />- Modern Physics<br />。Laser (Application: LASIK, PRK)<br />。X-ray (Application: X-ray Imaging, CAT)<br />。Pair Annihilation (Application: PET)<br />。NMR (Application: MRI)<br /><br />As time passed by, the chapters of Ng Yee Fai part became easier. For this chapter, X-ray, pair annihilation and NMR are the more difficult parts, comprising a large portion of the chapter. But at least, way easier to understand compared to daily applications!<br /><br />5. Disasters⭐⭐⭐<br />- Stellar Impact (e.g. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, the Cretaceous extinction, The Chelyabinsk Asteroid, The Yunnan Fireball, A/2017 U1)<br /><br />- Earthquake (Seismic waves, Earth's internal layers, earthquake causes, magnitude scales)<br /><br />- Nuclear weapons<br />。Atomic bombs (Little Boy, The Gadget, Fat Man)<br />。Hydrogen Bomb (Fusion Bomb)<br />。Aftermath of nuclear explosions<br /><br />- Nuclear Reactor Accidents (The Three Mile Island Accident, The Chernobyl Accident, The Fukushima Accident)<br /><br />Largely related to the chapter of Energy (the first chapter listed). The earthquake and nuclear weapon parts are relatively difficult, composing a large part of this chapter.<br /><br />6. Environmental Issues ⭐⭐<br />a. Solar Radiation<br />b. Greenhouse Effect<br />c. The Keeling Curve<br />d. Global Warming<br />e. Carbon footprint<br /><br />The easiest chapter, throughout the WHOLE COURSE, because they are mainly senior level Geography stuff, with less details.<br /><br />Each chapter has a slide of around 80-100 pages. Some of the pages are just video, pictures and demonstrations, but most of them will be wordy contextual details.<br /><br />Lin Nian part:<br />1. Introduction⭐<br />Shit intro.<br /><br />2. New Material and Physics ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /><br />Current Materials<br />- Silicon<br />(Application: PN-junction diode, PNP-junction transistor)<br />- Carbon (Graphite and Graphene)<br />(Application: Flexible display, graphene nanoribbons, carbon nanotube)<br /><br />Future Materials<br />- Metamaterials (Invisible cloaking, negative refractive index)<br />- Quantum materials (Quantum hall effect)<br /><br />Supplement: Superconductors<br /><br />3. Microscopy and Nanotechnology⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /><br />Microscopy<br />- History<br />- Properties of light (EM wave, diffraction)<br />- X-ray crystallography <br />- Double-slit experiment<br />- Scanning Electron Microscopy<br />- Transmission Electron Microscopy<br />- Quantum tunneling effects (Application: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy)<br />- Atomic force microscopy<br /><br />Nanotech<br />- Definition<br />- Damascus<br />- Properties at nanometer scale (subatomic scale)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Gold<br />- Quantum confinement<br />- Application: sunscreens<br />- Quantum Dot displays<br />- Nano-fabrication (Lithography: E-beam, Focused Ion beam, Molecular beam epitaxy)<br /><br />4. Information Technology and Physics ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />- Magnetic data storage<br />。Magnetism (Spin, Curie Temperature, Magnetic domains, etc.)<br />。Data Storage (GMR, TMR, MTJ)<br /><br />- Quantum computer<br />。Uncertainty Principle<br />。Particle and Wave Duality<br />。Superposition<br />。Qubit<br />。Advantages of quantum computer<br /><br />- Quantum communication<br />。quantum entanglement<br /><br />5. Future and Unsolved Problems⭐<br />Quantum gravity, particle masses, quantum measurement, turbulence, dark energy, dark matter, complexity, matter-antimatter asymmetry, friction, arrow of time<br /><br />Just some brief introduction to the above unsolved problems and ending of the course.<br /><br />I had many question marks on my head whenever I took a seat in Lin Nian's lecture. I could not even understand his notes. Of course they are more concise than Ng Yee Fai's, but the notes gave no explanation (just some random combinations of description, pictures and mathematical equations).<br /><br />&quot;Ahhhhhh..... Mathematics is intrinsically fucking beautiful......&quot;<br /><br />====GUEST LECTURES====<br /><br />Liu Tao: Elementary Particles and Standard Model<br />?????????????????????????????????????????????<br /><br />Wang Yi: Universe and Cosmology<br />I can say I know what is going on, but I cannot say so either.......<br /><br />Two documentaries:<br />- The Big Bang Machine<br />- Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking<br /><br />Long documentaries. I think I do not really love physics (or science). I found the documentaries uninteresting, but sure, way more understandable than the NOTES of the guest lectures.",

The lecture consists of you doing 10 multiple choice questions for 30 minutes, and you would finish them by like 5 minutes. Or you can choose to not do them at all because right after those 30 minutes, the TA gives you all the answers!
