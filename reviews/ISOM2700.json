Before the midterm the course content is basically some fundamental concepts and a few formulae to apply in the queuing model part, so it should be manageable for most students. The difficulty increases after the midterm cuz it involves identifying the situation and applying the same formula (especially the newsvendor formula and the critical fractile thingy) in seemingly very different contexts. Make sure you grasp the concept well and know how to apply appropriate formulae based on the situation given.<br /><br />But overall this course is pretty easy to handle if you've attended all the lessons and paid some effort in understanding the materials. It's recommended that you've taken the statistics course (ISOM2500) before you register this course to help you better understand the lecture materials. The Excel skills she teaches is optional, but you may wanna learn a bit of them cuz they're so damn useful. (You have to know how to read the Excel sensitivity analysis tho)",

Though at first, she looked like a student doing a presentation in front of the class lol, her teaching became better after a few lessons. The lecture materials are very well made, clean and easy to follow. She goes through complicated concepts one-by-one and explains them step-by-step. I have no difficulty catching up the course content.",

His online lectures are super useful as he will provide more details and skills for a certain concept or calculation. Make sure you study all online lectures if you are in his class.

Means we only have to write theories in the cheatsheet.

One thing that shocked me the most is that I am able to get his response via email within 20 mins every time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, he puts a huge effort in teaching. You could definitely feel his passion if you were his students. His PPT is clear and to-the-point which is easy for me to comprehend. He also controls the pace of his teaching well. More on that, his pronunciation is clear and he is good at explaining concepts. Stupid people like me are able to understand what’s going on during the lecture. One thing that I love the most is that he will finish one PPT per lecture, and never splitting one PPT between 2 lectures. So every lecture will always start with a new topic. It is extremely friendly for students like me who will never revisit the learnt material after class:). However, no attendance is taken in his lesson and lecture recordings are uploaded on canvas punctually. Around 70% of students skipped his lesson. It is sad to see as Prof Shen really prepared a lot for his lecture.<br /><br />In order to help us to prepare well for the exams, he posts a lot of practice questions of every chapter on Canvas and the question type is similar to what appeared in the exam. <br /><br />Note: Every Monday he will hold a one hour consultation session online for us to ask questions. <br /><br />He is a humble person who always ask for feedback about his lesson. (He really listened what we said and made improvement!!!)<br /> <br />The TA Jing is also very responsive and polite. In paper checking session, she will explain to us EVERY question that we got wrong in detail, even if I didn’t ask her.

Perfectly manageable and reading and taking some time to understand the slides and you will do fine in this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "The slides are basically sufficient for your exam and the professor posts recordings on Canvas but based off my experience, reading the slides will be sufficient and attending the lectures themselves will not be necessary. However, you may be able to benefit from the lectures as the professor will explain some practical questions in class that students find hard to understand and some of them are questions that will show up in your homework. The professor can be quite eccentric but is flexible to comment and is willing to change his teaching activities based on demand.",
            "comment_grading": "Since every assignment and exams are basically MCs, there is not really much room for the professor to give you looser grading or whatever. However, the professor will give you written detailed explanations on homework and has a review session for the midterm.(None for the final, which is a norm for UST). Therefore, the grading is reasonable and there is nothing special about it and you can always understand which part did you mess up in your homework or exam afterwards.",
            "comment_workload": "For exams, the professors give you sufficient material in your homework and practice problems to help you prepare for them. Basically start revising a few days before exam and revise a topic a day and do one set of practice questions. That basically only takes at most two hours( a conservative estimate) and you will be fine in your exams. As for homework, the professor literally only set a one hour limit for your homework so there is no need to worry that you need to spend hours on homework as there is simply no such possibility. However, the homework can be quite challenging and that one hour will be barely enough for you to do all your tasks.",

The videos such as flight arrangement or foresting are just repeating what Professor said in the lecture. Sometimes, they speak a little slow and consist of little accents, so I recommend playing the lecture video at 2x speed.<br /><br />They are very helpful in answering student questions.

For a student who has basically no business background like me, Prof.Gurumurthi's class could not only be an introductory course for OM, but also a good introductory to the business world.<br /><br />CHOOSE HIM!!!

The final score was hidden but I guess I was above mean and my overall grade was A.<br /><br />The grade distribution was said to be<br />A10% -20%<br />B25% -40% <br />C35% -45%<br />D5% -10%<br />F0% -5%<br />but the professor was really nice and I think the A range consists of at least 20%.",

There is a fair balance between the quantitative and qualitative aspects of operations management.

Interesting course if you want to know more about operations management.",

He also likes to raise questions, just not many students answering XD.<br />For each topic, he would have the pre-lecture ppt at first and uploaded the notes-taken post ppt afterwards. Therefore, for the students who missed his lessons can have the detailed notes and steps. <br />Before the mid-term exam, he did not post the lecture videos online. As some students requested, he posted the lecture videos for our mid term revision one week before the exam. Afterwards, he did a survey with us and most of us wanted to have the uploaded lecture videos, so he made the change that every video would be uploaded after each lesson. I am not sure whether he will do the same for the next semester, but he is very willing to help the students, he also provided more extra exercises for the class upon requests.",

            "comment_content": "Last year, Ronald tried out the Blended Learning system. He said in class, that he made a fatal mistake. That was, the project system he implemented. It made his SFQ going down from ~90% to ~50%, and triggered a course review from the department.<br /><br />This year, he greatly reduced the number of games (3 this year). It was no longer a workload, but an event to rescue student's grade. He remade some videos online, they looked neat and tidy. He spent more time in class to teach, this kept students' learning in progress. On top of all these, he removed the project. <br /><br />The contents itself did not change much.",

It is also clear that he is really familiar with the stuff.<br />He can't pronounce Japanese terms properly, although he seemed like them very much.<br /><br />He is patient and willing to answer questions. If you cannot organise your question well, he is happy to explain the whole thing in Cantonese.",

I don't know why, but Ronald's PRS will have 99% students answering the correct answer, the bar chart shows one straight bar and one or two lonely students (that's me)<br /><br />You Need to revise for this course.",

Examples of such processes include auto manufacturing process, servicing customers in restaurants/coffee shops, healthcare services offered by hospitals, online marketplaces, sharing-economy platforms or airlines offering connections between different cities. These businesses/organizations are primarily concerned about: (1) creating value through products/services, which in turn generates demand; and (2) satisfying the demand in an “efficient’’ fashion. In this course, we will address the latter issue in a systematic fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />(course description from SPRING 2018 course syllabus) <br /><br />Personally, the content is very interesting for me since it's very practicable. I think that the content is useful for business student from any department.",

            "comment_teaching": "His teaching is good, quite clear but sometimes he might even not able to answer students' questions. That's pretty weird but it would not affect your exam performance. And he likes to write something extra on the lesson which hasn't shown on his powerpoint but I think these are something additional. I did not copy them and I still understand all of his contents. So don't be worry about it. But if you want to understand more about operation management deeply, for sure I encourage you to take notes on his lessons.",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is fair. And since the midterm (35%) and the final exam (45%) are all just MC questions and this course mainly talks about applying formulas to calculate like the number of customers waiting in line or how much inventory do we need to order, if you can get an answer more or less the same as the MC choices provided to you, you can still get the answer by choosing the closest one. However, if you are not that type who are good at MC, be careful of it.<br /><br />His grading also base on other aspects such as participation 5%(randomly taking attendance) and the homework assignment 15%. But I would say that these 20% is quite easy to get as long as you really do your homework and take attendance (actually you may even ask your friend to check whether that lesson have to take attendance or not and you go to lesson when there is attendance taking on that day, but attendance taking will be available for the first 15mins only!!!).",
            "comment_workload": "I would say his workload is quite heavy compared to other courses. Even though there isn't any group work, but sometimes he gave out assignments in a very short period. For example, assignment 2 was due on Mar 9 but assignment 3 was due on Mar 16. And then assignment 4 was due on Apr 11 while assignment 5 was due on Apr 20. It might be a little bit harsh. But luckily no more group projects or presentations are needed.",

He used quite a lot of business cases to illustrate the specific topic after finishing his ppt. He also delivered clear lectures, that made his lecture easy to follow.<br /><br />Even though you might get all key points from his ppt, his lectures were really useful for better understandings and make your life much easier before the exams.",

Everything in the exam had been taught. Calculation taught during class time had similar difficulty as in the exam. Calculation exercises uploaded to canvas were quite useful.<br /> <br />I scored above mean (SD not provided) for both exams, below mean for participation and I am very satisfied with my grade.",

So... :P<br /><br />Exams were not cumulative and the notes were quite easily to follow, it shouldn't be a big deal to study for the 2 exams as long as you understand the lecture notes (and attend the class).",

The group project is also quite simple, as it's based on identifying and solving the bottleneck of an everyday process (max. 3 pages). You also need to create a video presentation for your group project.<br /><br />It is important to read all the cases before class though, especially if you want to participate during class when the professor asks case-related questions. <br /><br />For revision, going through the lecture slides and case studies should be enough to gain a complete understanding of what's required for the exam.",

Final + Midterm account for 50%.<br />The final and midterm were easy, since he only tested you the materials he taught. <br />Besides lecture notes, all of the case studies were also included in the final and midterm. However, don't worry, they are quite intuitive. <br /><br />2. Class Participation (15%)<br />I think class participation plays a major role if you want to get A-range for this course. You should always try to contribute some ideas during the lectures to get the participation marks, since other people should get quite the same scores as yours in terms of attendance, case paper, and group project.<br /><br />No one really knows how he distribute the participation marks. Neither the professor nor the TA record the students' names when the students participated in class discussion. <br /><br />For me, I moderately participated and contributed in the discussion. At last, the class participation mark I received was quite satisfactory. Perhaps, it was because only a few students really took part in the discussion. So, it's your call guysss<br /><br />3. Class Attendance (10%)<br /><br />4. Group Case Discussion Paper (15% - 5 case)<br />All of the groups get 100 for all of the cases (except once, one of the group got 75). The objective of case discussions was only to encourage students to read the case before the class. <br /><br />5. Group Project (10% - Video Presentation + Report)",
            "comment_workload": "Average workload.<br /><br />There are:<br />1. 5 case discussions, with maximum 2 pages each. (Group)<br /><br />2. Group project at the end of the course (Video Presentation 15 minutes + Report 4 pages). Basically, the group project aims to let you identify what problems are there in a particular company or shop of your choice, and then ask you to improve or solve the problem. You can easily incorporate the knowledge you learn in the course to do finish the group project. <br /><br />3. In total, there are around 10 case studies that you should read before the lectures. I highly recommend you to read the cases he provided because they are directly related to the lectures. <br />He will always discuss the case in class, and ask some questions about it. He also encourage student to participate during discussion.",

Submit the work on time - and remember quality of work also matters. <br />4.

Not if you've worked out a way to cooperate with your teammates: the case studies are groupwork and you can assign one question to each of the 5 members if there are 5 questions in the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the video is just 3 minutes or so, which means it's not very substantial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat it as a vocal summary of your paper - which isn't a big deal either if you start gathering ideas earlier on.",

I don't really understand and like this kind of course, where they don't even allow you to check your answers and mistakes, where some students just want to understand their mistakes and are not just chasing for extra marks.<br /><br />Quoted from the Announcements:<br />&quot;We have checked the answer and error rate for each exam question thoroughly and didn't find any major issue. Since we already adjusted the cutoff points with a much larger margin than usual for assigning grades, there is really no reason for anyone to try to argue about the correctness or interpretation of some individual answers. Therefore, paper checking is not encouraged.<br /><br />Likewise, even if you are at the very border of the cutoff point of another higher grade, we won't consider making further adjustment as everyone has already received one or two sub-letter grade better than what you expect if a regular grading scheme is applied.&quot;",

The only issue would be his what it feels like demeaning reaction to when you get an answer wrong. In addition, in comparison to what I have heard from another class, he focuses more on the mathematics side of the course, whereas for the other class it is mainly group work and case studies.<br />NOTE THAT IF YOU ARE IN HIS CLASS, ATTEND HIS CLASSES BECAUSE HE LIKES TO REMOVE THINGS IN THE POWER POINT AND ONLY STATE IT TO THOSE PRESENT IN CLASS.",

For studying for midterms and exams, understand concepts.
