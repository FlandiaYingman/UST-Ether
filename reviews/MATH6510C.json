        "description": "This course is directed to those students who are interested in pricing theory of financial derivatives. The course starts with the first principles in financial economics, like the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and risk neutral valuation principle. The Black-Scholes-Merton framework and martingale pricing approach are introduced. Pricing models of path dependent derivatives with embedded barrier features, lookback features and Asian averaging features are presented. Pricing formulations of popularly traded structured products, like accumulators, dynamic fund protection, variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, are discussed. Students should have taken several probability and statistics courses at the undergraduate level. No prior knowledge in stochastic calculus and finance is required. Students should seek the course instructor’s approval to take this course.",

            "comment_teaching": "Warning: Kyk speak Mandarin in class.<br /><br />As the only local student (who cannot speak Mandarin), it is a torture to attend the lectures.<br /><br />The lecture notes is not very well organized (as usual see RMBI 4210), and Kyk tends to jump between pages during the lecture. So, it is better to revisit the materials after class and try to understand it by yourself.<br /><br />I would say lecture only gives you the insight, and students are required to digest the materials after class.",

If you just want to pass the course, it is sufficient to memorize the main points in the lecture notes and some related problem set questions. However, if you want to learn from the materials, I suggest you to derive all the formulae in the lecture notes once (which is quite time consuming and I spent 2 weeks doing so when I study Topic 4-7 for final exam)<br /><br />Although there is no compulsory assignment, it is suggested to read through the problem set before the exam because some of the exam questions are similar to the questions in problem set.",
