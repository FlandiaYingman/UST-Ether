        "description": "This course aims at introducing students to modern concepts of light and art, and to lead them to realize a light installation using artificial light sources. Students will learn to experiment with light and shadow, and will explore artistic spatial concepts to engage the audience in their artworks and/or create site-and purpose-specific installations on the UST campus. The light sources used in this course will be mainly found and ready-made products available in Hong Kong on a budget. The students will be encouraged to work in small groups to be able to complete larger and more complex installations. Upon the completion of the course the students will have learnt to make use of common products and physical phenomena to create an unconventional artistic experience.",
