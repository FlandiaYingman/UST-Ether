            "comment_content": "An introductory course to anthropology. It starts with a brief introduction to the anthropological &quot;mindset&quot;, then moves to how we can analyze cultures in different dimensions. The way Prof Liu approaches anthropology seems quite different from the previous professor - instead of focusing on historical and socio-political issues, she digs into minor stuff around our daily lives we've usually taken for granted, and drills very deeply into specific examples. These really challenge what we have in mind and rewind our &quot;it-has-to-be-like-this&quot; way of thinking. Overall this is one of the very few courses in UST that can help us &quot;unlearn&quot; things and become open-minded towards things that just don't work as we think.<br /><br />Course Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs): (quoted from the course syllabus)<br />1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand basic terms, concepts, and theories in cultural anthropology about human culture<br />and society.<br />2Ô∏è‚É£ Develop an appreciation of cultural diversity and understand the meanings of different<br />cultural practices in their socio-cultural contexts.<br />3Ô∏è‚É£ Develop ethnographic research skills for collecting field data on human culture and society.<br /><br />Like what is said in other reviews, the content could be interesting, but could also be boring to those who aren't really into HUMA courses - I think most of us only take this course to fulfill the common core requirements. It's indeed worth a try if you wanna taste a new perspective of thinking about things in our daily lives, but think twice before registering this course if what you want is only easy good grade. It'll be hard if you can't grasp what the point of discussion is.<br /><br />Course outline<br />üî∑ Introducing Anthropological Ways of Thinking<br />üî∑ Concept of Culture<br />üî∑ Space<br />üî∑ Time<br />üî∑ Languages<br />üî∑ Relations and Relatedness Cultures<br />üî∑ Identity<br />üî∑ Bodies<br />üî∑ Food<br />üî∑ Clothes<br />üî∑ Emotions<br />üî∑ Rituals",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Liu really inspires us in her lectures. She illustrates numerous examples that deviate from our daily experience to showcase the beauty of cultural diversity. She also engages us in the tutorial discussion - but it ends up with endless chitchatting in our group LOL.<br /><br />No laptops, no phones, no chatting on her lectures.",

            "comment_workload": "IMHO quite heavy for a 1000-level course.<br /><br />There are a total of 9 tutorial assignments out of which 8 will be taken into the calculation of your grade. It's really a lot compared to other courses. The professor said it should be a piece of cake for us - but I don't think it is. The thing is that the assignments are due BEFORE the related content is even taught. I can't get the point of doing so. Maybe the tutorial assignments are intended to prepare us for the lectures - but as it turns out most of us get confused when doing the assignments.<br /><br />There are assigned readings every lecture flooded with difficult vocab and complicated sentence structures that will puzzle you. I'm a year-3 student and I gave up after reading a couple of them - but the prof said this course was designed for year-1 students üòµ. Attached is one of the assigned readings. Have a look.<br /><br />The norm violation project is a tough one. We're required to ideate and conduct a norm-violating social experiment, write a 6-page ethnographic essay on our observations and analyze the situation from an anthropological perspective. But we are never taught how to write a good ethnographical essay and we have little idea of what is exactly expected in the writing. Though the TAs have given us some advice on the writing, I believe most of us still remain puzzled.<br /><br />The final is a take-home exam with 4 short questions and 2 long essays based on the lectures and the assigned readings. We are given 3 days to complete it. Attached are the take-home exam questions. Take a look.<br /><br />(Since it's a take-home exam directly available on Canvas I think it's fine to post it here.)",

It provides a way of seeing the world and the place(s) of humanity in it that <br />emphasizes holism, experiential learning, and comparison. Anthropology is as concerned with <br />understanding the differences between and within groups of people as it is with the similarities <br />that make all of us equally human. Moreover, it offers a perspective on difference that allows us <br />to see how some differences have been historically infused with power, resulting not just in <br />difference, but deep-seated inequalities. This course introduces students to the core questions, <br />conversations, and concepts that have driven anthropological research and whose discussions have <br />provided valuable insight into the human experience.",

The assignments do not take a long time to do; the maximum time limit for the short film was 3 minutes and you only have to write around 1000 words for the final essay. The deadline for the final essay was set after the final exam period, so you could finish your exams then write the essay afterwards.",
