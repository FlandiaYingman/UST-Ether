        "description": "This course covers game-theoretic works on communication. It maintains a healthy balance between classic/core papers and more recent papers, and between theory papers and experimental papers. Some of the topics covered is sender-receiver games, mediated communication, psychological aspects of communication, and game theory at the intersection of economics and linguistics. The goal is to stimulate original (theoretical and/or experimental) research in one of these areas.",
