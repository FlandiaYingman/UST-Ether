        "description": "[Alternate code(s): CIVL 4100E] The primary aim of this course is to convey fundamental scientific knowledge of the Earth’s climate system, to develop the technical skill for climate modeling and analysis, and to understand the relationship between the impact of climate change and strategies to manage associated risks. Emphasis will be placed on the “practical exercise” for the simulation of future climate in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases using the web-based global climate model (EdGCM) with a user-friendly interface that can be run on laptop or desktop computer. Through this practice, students will learn full scientific processes related to climate modeling such as experimental design, running simulation, data analysis, and interpretation of results. On this foundation, the latter half of the course will be shifted to the topics for the identification and assessment of the risks from climate extremes. Eventually, students will have familiarity with climate modeling techniques and better sense to grapple with a myriad of complex climate issues.",

            "comment_content": "I feel like this course deserves much more attention, at least for those who are interested in climate science/climate change (I'm talking to you CIVL/ENVS/EVMT/PHYS people).<br /><br />The content's straightforward and practical, or in one sentence, &quot;using climate models to predict the future climate under anthropogenic influences and assess the risks associated with such climatological changes.&quot;<br /><br />PART I: Climate Modeling<br />- basics of computer modeling, I mean the REALLY basic concepts of computing (how rate of change is treated in computers, resolution, computing time)<br />- the 7 governing equations of climate models (from Conservation of Momentum to Ideal Gas Law) - don't be scared by their mathematical forms, you won't actually use them for calculations (but you'll need to understand the physical meaning of the equations and their corresponding variables)<br />- types of climate models<br />- and the best part, how to use a climate model (it's a greatly simplified one for educational purposes tho) to predict the future climate under climate change <br /><br />PART II: Risk Assessment<br />- what risks are (according to IPCC)<br />- types of extreme weather under climate change - heat waves, cold spells, extreme precipitation, drought, sea level rise and tropical cyclones<br />- and, assessing risks of course<br /><br />FYI the department is thinking of making this course a common core course in the future, not sure how this will work out tho.",
            "comment_teaching": "Well, Prof. Im has a pretty heavy Korean accent, but she puts in great effort each lecture to make sure everyone is on the same page with her. <br /><br />Personally, I only understood 50% of what she said in the first lecture, but I could fully understand her English after 2 weeks.<br /><br />Apart from the accent, her teaching is great. She explains difficult concepts from fluid dynamics very clearly in an easily understandable fashion. She asks students randomly to check if they really understand important concepts, and she reviews them again in the next lecture.",
            "comment_grading": "Not sure about the statistics, but Prof. Im claimed (in her heavy korean accent of course) &quot;Don't worry, I'll give good grades to everyone&quot;.<br /><br />Grading Scheme:<br />2 quizzes, 10% each<br />1 report on climate modeling, 30%<br />1 report on risk assessment, 10%<br />1 final exam, 40%<br /><br />I got the highest score in both quizzes (they were extremely easy, I think the mean was 90+% for both), did not receive any information on the reports/final, final grade A+.",
            "comment_workload": "Quiz: super easy, just need a bit of memorization (questions are literally just copied from the slides)<br /><br />Reports: these are going to take you some time. You have way too much data available, so you have to skillfully select the ones you need and make sense out of them. They are pretty interesting if you like the contents of this course.<br /><br />Final: again, Prof. Im legit goes through the questions in her review lecture, just go to class",
