        "description": "This course focuses on how companies identify, evaluate, and capture decision analytic opportunities to create value. Basic analytic methods as well as real corporate cases studies will be covered. The analytical methods include ways to use data to develop insights and predictive capabilities using machine learning, data mining, and forecasting techniques. Some aspects of the use of optimization methods to support decision-making in the presence of a large number of alternatives and business constraints will be covered. The concepts learned in this class should help students identify opportunities in which decision analytics can be used to improve performance and support important decisions.",

Contents are quite interesting and this course focus more on concept stuffs so if you are interested in machine learning and you are good in remembering things, then you can easily get good grad in this course.<br /><br />The regression part is very similar to what we've learned in IEDA2540, so if you want to do some restudy of this course, i suggest you can revised the linear regression. <br />I remembered it is required course for DA students, and actually this course is quite useful and good to include this into our major requirement.",
            "comment_teaching": "Idk because i skipped all lesson by knowing its prof Zhang.<br />The lab also very boring. TA just following the notes without explaining. Labs are just teaching you how to write the code by calling the libraries in python. So if you are good at python for machine learning or you are fast learner, then its ok for you not to attend the lab.",
            "comment_grading": "For me, I think it is quite good. Be really careful in exam, no computation too. Concepts and the relationships between diff methods are important. <br /><br />My semester was online teaching, so the final exam is done on caverns and the format is MCs. <br />My final: 42/55 <br />project : full <br />got A",
            "comment_workload": "Some coding assignments. Just coping the lab notes is ok. &lt;1 hour per hw. No computation questions in assignment.<br /><br />30% project, 40% final, homework, lab and quiz 30%<br />Projects are 4 in 1 group, required written report with graphs or charts, slides for presentation, corresponding codes for your project, and finally a 12 minutes video presentation. <br /><br />The best thing of this course is that it doesn't have MT!!",
