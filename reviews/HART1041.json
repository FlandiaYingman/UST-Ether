            "comment_content": "One of the best course and surely the most interesting course I have taken in HKUST. Very different from any other course. Cover different singing techniques and body gestures, staging and performance. But the accapella part is removed due to limit of time. In the second half, requires much time to watch others' performance instead of individual teaching.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor can tackle each person's weak point and provide guidance on how to improve them. Very useful if you really want to improve singing in this course. Patrick is nice and makes you feel confident when performing.",

Including staging and props.<br />Performance Review (15%) : Not much instructions given on this but it wasn't hard.<br />Final Performance (40%) : We didn't do accapella, just sing another song/same song from midterm. So it wasn't heavy workload.<br />No homework! which is good!",
