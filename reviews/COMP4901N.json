        "description": "Cyber-attacks mounted by malicious attackers have been creating significant damage to various companies and individuals around the globe in the recent years; cybersecurity is now a high priority consideration for the major businesses worldwide. To deepen the practical knowledge in fighting against the cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity competitions are being organized every year by various institutions and organizations. This course prepares interested students with the practical knowledge for taking part in cybersecurity contests. The course will be offered as a 0-credit course in the Fall semester. Enrolled students will learn the common topics in the first 5 weeks of the Fall, getting trained in fundamental knowledge of cybersecurity.  Then they will divide into two tracks in the remainder of the Fall. One track will be concentrating on topics like binary analysis, reverse engineering, the other track will be concentrating on topics like web exploitation, cryptography, computer forensics, and other miscellaneous topics. Graded P or F.",

You can even ask your homework if you really can't solve it, they will give you hints too. ;)<br /><br />While actually, you can chat anything in the Discord group.

            "comment_grading": "Good grading, just P/F.<br /><br />50% - Attendance<br />50% - Track A in-class exercises and homework<br />50% - Track B in-class exercises and homework<br /><br />So technically, the maximum score that you could get is 150%, where 60% would be a pass. By getting a full score in attendance and doing some in-class exercises (In-class exercise will be demonstrated in-class so you could get the flag by copying it), you must get a P grade so it's very difficult to get an F.<br /><br />However, if you aim for a more advanced course - COMP4901O, you will have to get a better performance in order to be invited to join the more advanced course.",
            "comment_workload": "To be honest, the only workload would be doing the homework. The homework is not difficult if you could understand the contents taught in the class. It just requires a lot of time to think/guess (and Google. Yes, trust me, Google is your BEST friend) the correct approach to hack the machine and get the flag.<br /><br />For me, I usually start to do the homework immediately after the class. Sometimes I finish the homework by doing it few hours continuously, while sometimes I need to take more time so that I will have to spend time doing it half of a day in the next day. Great to spend time if you feel boring (like if you feel all the courses in UST are easy for you) or if your parents ask you why you seem to be having lots of free time in UST.<br /><br />To conclude, try harder, Try Harder, TRY HARDER, then you'll find the flag : D",

            "comment_content": "(Note: This course is being rebranded as COMP2633.)<br /><br />If you're an escapist and loathe some of the more annoying classes of UST (looking at you math3033), then this course is just right for you... maybe. If you, like me previously, have never touched the field of cybersecurity before and you're even the tiniest bit interested, this course is for you.<br /><br />This is the first in a series of three courses (COMP4901N/O/P, now rebranded as COMP2633/3633/4633). So if you do well in this course, you'll get to advance and learn/experience potentially more. Since this course is introductory, content goes for more breadth and less depth.<br /><br />After the first couple weeks, you'll be asked to select either Track A (pwn/binary/reverse) or Track B (web/crypto/misc)‚Äìmore on these below. Just keep in mind that the tracks are merely a formality. You can cherry pick whatever challenge and topic you want: e.g. maybe you like playing reverse and crypto but hate pwn and web.<br /><br />Everything in this course (CTFs in general, actually) is rather hands-on. So if you rather hack something than learn whatever a second derivative telescoping triplosive Bodeman-Weiestrass clopen set is... then just clicky click the enrol button.<br /><br />To give you an idea what topics are available:<br /><br /> - pwn/binary: study assembly, compiler/processor nuances<br /> - reverse: discover what an app is doing under the hood<br /> - web: study web browsers, php, frameworks<br /> - crypto: break ciphers, do meth, get high<br /> - misc: image/audio/disk/packet nuances and other fun little things",
            "comment_teaching": "Taught by students, for students.<br /><br />Similar structure to Robotics Team. You enter as a trainee. You get filtered (selected). You get filtered some more. Finally you ascend into the upper echelons and gain the opportunity to preach your wisdom to the next generation of lost sheep.<br /><br />I'd say the teaching was mostly good? Some were quite good, while some were ungood. But overall, I'd say at the same level, or even better than a lot of professors.<br /><br />The best teacher, however, is experience. Get your hands dirty, run the scripts, and hack away as you escape from the reality of UST.",
            "comment_grading": "Reasonable grading. Submit attendance flags. Do your homework. Profit.<br /><br />Assuming people don't cheat and share flags (which you shouldn't), then there is a strong correlation between your effort and your grade.<br /><br />I won't talk too much about stats here. Not much has changed so you can just check the older reviews for details.",
            "comment_workload": "This is quite variable as it depends on experience, knowledge, which track(s) you choose, the support you receive from the seniors, and most of all... endurance. How much are you willing to suffer to find the flags?<br /><br />If you have experience with the web and networking, you may find the web challenges easier to comprehend.<br /><br />If you have experience with assembly, you may find the pwn/binary/reverse challenges easier to crack. Having taken COMP2611, I found these challenges were generally easier to navigate.<br /><br />Regardless, you're here to learn. If you want to rank high and advance to COMP4901O (now COMP3633), you'll need to sacrifice quite a bit of time. If all you want is to pass, you just need to submit attendance flags (which are basically free); but IMHO you would just be wasting your time.<br /><br />But eh, just have fun.",
