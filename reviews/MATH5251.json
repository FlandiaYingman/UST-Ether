            "comment_content": "The major reference book for the course is &quot;Algebraic Geometry&quot; by R. Hartshorne. The content of the course covers Chapter 1, and first five sections of Chapter 2 in Hartshorne. The other reference books include &quot;Introduction to Commutative Algebra&quot; by Atiyah and Macdonald.<br /><br />I think although the course suggests MATH 5111 (Advanced Algebra I) as background, the most important prerequisite of the course is commutative algebra. The course kind of assume the results from commutative algebra, and apply the results frequently. If you would like to take the course, I think you should probably read and do some exercises in the book before enrolling in the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "I think the professor taught quite well. The professor has explained the concepts clearly, and often provide some analogue (or similar examples) of the new concept which is just introduced. The&nbsp;&nbsp;professor talked about the motivations of introducing a new concept before started talking about it, which is quite important for me as it provides reasons / incentive to study something.<br /><br />The pace of teaching is quite fast for me, three hours lecture with two breaks between. Although attendance is not required for the course, it is recommended to attend each lesson as he covers a lot of content each lesson, it is easy to fall behind if you are not attending the lesson.<br /><br />The professor is quite friendly and welcome questions from students, although normally there is only one student who is asking questions. As there are a lot of concepts (and definitions), the professor actually encouraged us to ask questions to avoid misunderstanding.",
            "comment_grading": "The only assessment in the course this year is the final exam, in which you have to do one homework problem in three hours and submit the solution. The usual practice back then is to present your solution to the professor, but it is changed due to COVID. The examination problem for everyone is different. Professor would draw two questions out of the box, and you have to do one of them. The level of difficulty differs a lot, some can be done in one line, and some requires pages of proof.<br /><br />I am lucky to have a question that is moderately easy, and the grade is quite satisfactory for me. My friend, who is enrolled in the same course, got a decent grade also. Although there is no data on the distribution of the grade, I think the grading for the course is quite good.",
            "comment_workload": "The professor assigns homework problems after each section. It is recommended that you should do homework after it is released, instead of accumulating them (like me) and do it towards the end of semester. Firstly, the difficulty of the homework varies for each section, and for some sections it is very difficult for me. I did not have the time to complete all the assigned homework questions eventually. Secondly, doing the questions review what you have learnt in the lectures. Otherwise, it is likely to fall behind.<br /><br />If you know some commutative algebra beforehand, the workload should be lighter as you do not have to go over the Commutative Algebra book.",
