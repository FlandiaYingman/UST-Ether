Depends if you think any workload for a 0-credit course is too much workload, I guess.<br /><br />Everything's clearly laid out for you during the first compulsory lecture though, and supposedly your peer mentor will remind you of anything you need to do, so nothing to stress too much over.<br /><br />For the PDS hours, you can either attend introductory engineering talks (1.5hr each usually) or attend one workshop of 3 hours (3D printing, laser cutting, etc.). Just remember to sign up in advance if you want to attend the workshops since there is a limited quota.<br /><br />Honestly, the only complaint I have about the workload is that the time block for this course takes up every week for the whole semester despite the minimal workload. So even though you actually only show up once or twice during the allotted time (advising and workshops are held at other times, and talks may be held on a day that wasn't allotted to you), it stops you from registering for other courses that are set at the same time, especially tutorials.",
