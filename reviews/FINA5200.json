        "description": "The course will analyze asset management through the lens of risk --- including defining risk, diversification, hedge, leverage, and risk premium --- in the context of bonds, stocks, derivatives, and alternative investments. The course serves as an introduction to capital markets, discusses basic concepts in these markets that anyone who wants to work in asset management should know (though these concepts are not easy and technical tools are sometimes required), and lays the foundation for taking more advanced courses.",
