            "comment_content": "Most stuff based on his own experiences. If you wanna leave a good impression, research on famous/blockbuster drugs and Pharma companies and answer questions in class and he will remember you. Participation was highly emphasized by him but the grade actually wasn't affected by it that much, maybe just a sub-grade. Exam was very easy (for open book), but the content depends on what the groups projects were about. Do your project well (basically a shorter and more free/imaginative version of your capstone) -- &quot;invent&quot; and/or commercialize a biotech product/ analyse a biotech company (latter not that preferred by him) that he likes. Relax, for project you can receive a lot of help from him.",
            "comment_teaching": "After like 2 weeks of lessons, the rest of the lectures were for group project presentations and career talk by alumni/company people. You have to present your ideas, draft and final product.",
            "comment_grading": "Fair enough I guess. Got A- after completing all stuff with little participation in class (he did not remember my name). Exam is only around 20% and is very easy to get full marks. Participation counted around 10-20%. Seems marks of&nbsp;&nbsp;different projects were close too, so do make an impression. He likes talking about drugs and most groups chose to do drugs, but some sort of water purification system and bio-lamp were done too.",
            "comment_workload": "Basically just the project. He does expect you to know what you are designing well, e.g. the technology you choose, how feasible it is, how do you convince investors, clinical trials you plan to do... In our term, only the presentation was compulsory (graded together with professor Wong Yung Hou). Written report was optional but highly encouraged.",
