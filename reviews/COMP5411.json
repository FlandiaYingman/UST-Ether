            "comment_content": "The course is divided into two parts: Geometry and Rendering. They are completely independent with their own instructors, assessments and exams.<br /><br />For the most part, the geometry section is interesting and challenging. It contains quite a bit of linear algebra and other math concepts, so be sure to pay attention to those parts. The exam will focus on the math and pros and cons of the techniques introduced in class.<br /><br />The topic list is:<br />(1) Transformation and viewing<br />(2) Mesh representation<br />(3) Bezier and Bspline curves and surfaces<br />(4) Mesh smoothing<br />(5) QEM Simplification<br />(6) Space-based deformation<br />(7) Surface-based deformation<br />(8) Skeleton extraction by mesh contraction<br />+ extra topics not covered in the exam<br /><br />Understanding the mathematical basis as well as the consequences is a must to get a good grade. I found the geometry exam rather difficult.<br /><br />Comparatively, the rendering part is far less math-focused and a lot more concept-focused. The most important part is to get an intuitive understanding of the concepts and why they are defined that way.<br /><br />The topic list is:<br />(1) Graphics pipeline and vertex processing<br />(2) Rasterization<br />(3) Pixel processing<br />(4) Shadows<br />(5) WebGL<br />(6) Geometry LOD (Level of detail)<br />(7) Shader LOD<br />(8) Geometry shaders and stream out<br />(9) GPGPU<br /><br />Make sure you internalize the definitions of all the new vocabulary in the rendering part.",
            "comment_teaching": "Both Chiew Lan and Pedro are fairly good. There is use of the whiteboard to explain some concepts, and the powerpoints have some cool step-by-step slides and videos. However, the class is not very interactive in general, so just expect some standard UST-style lecturing.<br /><br />There is no attendance taken, so going to lecture is optional.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />For geometry:<br />Written Homework: 20%<br />- These are problem set-like questions that test mainly the mathematical foundations of some of the topics.<br /><br />Programming Assignments: 20%<br />- You are given a code skeleton and are asked to implement some of the functions in it using math formulas or pseudocode covered in lecture or in the homework supplemental slides.<br /><br />Exam: 60%<br />- I thought this was really hard, and it was much more math-heavy than I anticipated. Be prepared for exam questions that test your ability to extend existing lecture concepts, and review the key pros and cons of each model within each topic.<br /><br />For rendering:<br />Project: 60%<br />- This involves creating a graphics project using with custom shaders. It can be as difficult as you want it to be. It consists of creating a proposal, a presentation, and a final product.<br /><br />Exam: 40%<br />- The exam is short and tests mainly conceptual understanding. Be sure to memorize the Phong illumination equation!!<br /><br />Overall ~80% -&gt; A",
            "comment_workload": "The geometry part is somewhat heavy in workload. The problem sets take just a short amount of time. The programming assignments are also generally straightforward, but take a while to complete (about 6 or 7 hours to fully debug, and I am fairly good at coding if I say so myself), so don't put it off until the last minute.<br /><br />The rendering part is comparatively light in workload, although it depends on what project you are proposing. A very complicated project could potentially score more points at the cost of needing to put in a lot more work. So the workload is heavy only if you want it to be. If you've taken COMP 4451 (Game Programming) before, this section is a piece of cake.",

            "comment_content": "This course comprises two parts: the first half (till Oct. 20) is about geometry, and the rest is about rendering.<br />The topics in the geometry part include:<br />1. Mesh representation<br />2. Parametric surfaces, focusing on BÃ©zier curves.<br />3. Subdivision surfaces, including the Catmull-Clark subdivision, loop subdivision, and Doo-Sabin subdivision.<br />4. Remeshing<br />5. Surface-based deformation<br />6. Space-based deformation<br /><br />The rendering part focuses on rasterization-based rendering techniques, and slightly touches on ray tracing and GPGPU. Topics include:<br />1. Basic rendering pipeline stages, including rasterization, vertex shader, and pixel shader.<br />2. Texturing<br />3. Stencil testing and deferred shading.<br />4. Shadows<br />5. Acceleration techniques, including progressive mesh, caching, and shader LOD<br />6. Advanced rendering pipeline stages, including Geometry shader and Tesselation shader.<br />7. GPGPU (not enough time to finish)<br /><br />The rendering part is more difficult than I previously expected. Some parts of the geometry lectures may seem hard at first, but actually, the math behind is quite simple.",
            "comment_teaching": "The speaking volume of Prof. Tai is so low that It's difficult to hear what she's saying if you sit in the middle or back of the classroom. But she's doing pretty good at explaining the content.<br /><br />Prof. Sander is super kind to students, and his way of teaching is extremely good. The content of his lectures is interesting and also useful to learn.<br /><br />The most exciting part about the rendering part is the project. Prof. Sander gave a lot of freedom in selecting project topics, as long as they are focused on rendering. You can see a lot of interesting projects from your classmates. There are two dedicated classes, one for the proposal presentation, and the other for the final presentation. The two presentations are arranged to be engaging. You can type your questions in the chat box on Zoom, but you must be physically in the classroom and watch the others' presentations in person.",

Most projects are really interesting based on the final presentation.)<br /><br />Overall 93% --&gt; A+.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload at the geometry part is quite low. There are two programming assignments (actually 3 assignments because there's Assignment 0 that asks you to set up the environment and write several lines of code). The two assignments are lightweight in workload. The pseudo-code is almost given to you in the slides. Only tens of lines of code for each assignment.<br /><br />The workload in the rendering part entirely depends on you, as there is only one project. The typical workload is 500~1000 lines of code.",
