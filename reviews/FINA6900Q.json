        "description": "This course aims to help the participants understand a number of special topics in financial markets and bank intermediation. The first topic discusses the financial system, different types of financial markets and rationale for bank intermediation. The underlying reasons for bank intermediation include payment mechanism, liquidity provision, maturity and denomination transformation, risk transformation, economy of scale and asymmetric information. The next topic examines financial market microstructure including trading, traders and trade facilitators, different trading systems, types of orders, block trades and odd lots, regulated short selling, security margin trading, liquidity, and impacts of algorithmic trading and FinTech. The first two topics lay a good foundation to understand the CFA examination Level 1 curriculum in Market Organization and Structure (Equity). The third topic is related to recent cases of financial shenanigans in financial markets in terms of accounting tricks and financial gimmicks. These tricks and gimmicks are illustrated through a number of case studies. The final topic examines the issue of renminbi internationalization. Participants will join forces to understand this last topic through their own research, presentations and reports.",
