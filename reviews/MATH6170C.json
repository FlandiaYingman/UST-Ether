        "description": "The course covers the general cubic equation, the Weierstrass model and reduction mod p. Mordell's Theorem on finite generation of rational points of elliptic curves and its proof: Heights and descent.  Lattices and Weierstrass parametrization. Endomorphism structure and Complex multiplication. Constructing L-functions for elliptic curves. The construction of modular functions and forms. The j-function and singular moduli. Special values of L-functions. Some knowledge about algebraic geometry and complex analysis will be helpful. Students without course prerequisite should seek approval from the course instructor to take the course.",
