        "name": "Cultures and Values: Language, Communication and Society",
        "description": "Languages are considered complex repositories of cultures, where meanings are created and articulated, verbally and non-verbally, about the artefacts, norms, beliefs, and values of cultures. Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

Most of them are abstract.<br /><br />The project requires us to study a cultural site (not related to the Chinese culture) in Hong Kong. You will organize a site visit with ur team, and if possible, an interview with the people there. You need to jump out of the comfort zone which I really dont like. :(<br /><br />If your English is not excellent, do not go for this course.",

I would say light.<br />The project is conduct via the online whiteboard website &quot;Miro&quot; which is extremely un-userfriendly. <br /><br />Again the main difficulty is to jump out of the comfort zone, at least for me.",

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

I was quite active.<br />No idea what I got for the essay, but again I think I did a good job.<br />There's no reason why you wouldn't get all 20% for the writing workshops. <br /><br />I got an A. Not bad.",
            "comment_workload": "More workload than I had initially anticipated, but to be fair it was still totally reasonable.<br />I recommend completing all the Canvas &quot;quizzes&quot; (for the workshops) within the first week. It was time-consuming to complete all the quizzes in one go, but the good thing was that you can redo the quizzes until you get all the right answers. Plus, it was very satisfying to know that I had already gotten a lot of stuff done early on.<br />You should take a look at the essay topic options within the first few weeks and try to do some basic research to get a headstart. No need to worry too much about it though. <br />It is important to keep your essay concise and packed with information as there's a word limit (ours was 1100 words). <br />I talked to my assigned instructor regularly (as expected) to review my draft essay and overall progress. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is to listen to your instructor's feedback and improve your essay accordingly. Your ultimate goal should be to get good grades for your essay, and in order to achieve that it's necessary to follow the requirements at all times, even if it implies that you lose control over how you want your essay to be. <br />There will be 3 online (Canvas) discussions on assigned topics. Be sure to read the scoring criteria for such discussions.<br />For the lecture quiz, you'll have to go over all the notes and assigned readings to get good grades.",

It is good that Cathy includes useful examples and case studies whenever she illustrates important concepts.<br /><br />It is particularly interesting that Nineteen Eighty-Four is reviewed and analyzed from a socio-linguistic perspective. In the past, I would only appreciate it as a literary masterpiece that satires totalitarianism. So I would say this course really inspires me to interpret the novel from a new angle.",
            "comment_teaching": "It is not difficult to follow Cathy's lecture since her English is fluent and her explanation is clear enough. However, at some point you will find the lecture boring because of her bombarding you with lots of information. She might get lost of what she is presenting and tends to speak faster and faster. I suggest you to skip the lecture and watch the video instead if you realize the lecture is no longer inspiring.",
            "comment_grading": "60% of the score remains unknown. You will never know which part(s) you flunked out when your final grade sucks.<br /><br />Due to the suspension of classes, quiz 2 was cancelled and quiz 1 was double counted. The good thing is that Cathy allowed students who performed unsatisfactorily in quiz 1 to sign up the timed online quiz 2, and both quizzes will be counted. I only got 13/16 in quiz 1 (mean is 12.7, while max is 17 becoz of a bonus question) so I decided to take the online quiz. The quiz was extremely hard, in that almost every question refers to the exact wordings of one particular ppt slide, and the time allowed was very tight. Fortunately, I still managed to get full score in the quiz.<br /><br />Grading is pretty good overall. I have studied some other 2000-level HUMA before and ended up a B. In this course, comparatively, I could get an A. After all, the quality of your term essay remains the determining factor of your final grade. Though, if you desire an A+, you should aim at full score for both quizzes. With the same quality of term essay, what differentiates an A+ from an A is the subtle difference in quiz results.",
            "comment_workload": "While Cathy emphasizes there is no need to memorize the ppt slides, there is no harm to recite them, especially if you desire an A/A+. Getting one additional score is always preferred, right?<br /><br />For the term essay, my advise is to choose an essay prompt that you are familiar with. Before you start writing the essay, spend a reasonable amount of time to study the related reading materials. Never mind if your instructor gives you negative feedback. As long as you could make your essay from &quot;horrible&quot; to less horrible, your final grade will be perfectly fine. For me, the feedback on my draft essay was quite positive, except there is a minor problem in my rebuttal.",

If you are a person that likes to go broad instead of deep (like me), then this class will be interesting as you do learn a lot of things on different aspects.",

Her powerpoints are extremely rich in content (as compared to really simple slides for HUMA1000B), so you definitely learn a lot, though it will take you some time to memorise the facts for quiz.<br /><br />Pan also likes to ask questions, she even walks around in LT-A to invite students to answer her.<br /><br />The whole class needs to attend tutorials, but not all classes are taught by the same tutor. My tutor is John, and he is extremely nice and kind. He goes slow in class and gives us a lot of discussion time. And he is SUPER responsive when I ask for essay comments. But one advice to all HUMA1000 students: be sure to ASK questions, don't just sit in front of the tutor and expect him to tell you what's wrong. You got to ask really explicit questions that will help you get your answer.",

Finally I got an A. The trick to getting a better score for the essay part is respond to the tutor's comments. Apparently one grading criteria is improvement - so if your draft essay is &quot;horrible&quot;, but you managed to go to &quot;less horrible&quot; for your final essay, you will still get points for that.",

Quite short and easy to do. Just don't forget to do them.<br /><br />Essay isn't too tough if you pace out your work without deadline fighting. You get the three essay questions at the beginning of the course so you can decide which one to write about and think of what to write in advance.<br /><br />There are readings before class (which is extremely lengthy). If you choose to read it, you're workload would be really huge. But I only read the readings for the first week, and didn't read the rest. Still managed to get a nice grade for the course in the end. But reading it will definitely allow you to learn more.",

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and ‘othering’; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

            "comment_content": "The content is quite interesting compared to other courses.<br /><br />When we study human language, we are approaching what some might call the “human essence,” the distinctive qualities of mind that are, so far as we know, unique to man.<br /><br />- Noam Chomsky<br /><br />Languages are considered complex repositories of cultures, where meanings are created and articulated, verbally and non-verbally, about the artefacts, norms, beliefs, and values of cultures[1]. Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and ‘othering’; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.<br /><br />[1] See, for instance, Sorrells, K., 2016.",
