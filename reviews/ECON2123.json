And the difficulty of Macroeconomics should be a little bit higher than Microeconomics. As 2103 is mostly common sense. 2123 is getting tough starting from medium-run model. And since Short-run model (ISLM) is used for BOTH medium-run and open economy and it was also the only topic tested in midterm, make sure you understand the content before midterm well.",

Like how interest rate affect output (GDP), how government policies affect the economy and the relationship between output and price level with the aid of model. (needless to say: way more complicated than micro, much more factors to consider)<br /><br />Course outline<br />Part 1: Introduction to macroeconomics&nbsp;&nbsp;CH. 1-2 <br />- Introduce the concept of GDP, inflation, unemployment<br /><br />Part 2: The short run closed economy (IS-LM model) CH. 3-5<br />- talk about the goods and financial market, combining both market together to construct the IS-LM model. Apply the IS-LM model to predict and explain effects of fiscal and monetary policy, both separately and together.<br /><br />**basically these first 2 parts takes up almost half of the course, make sure you fully understand these 2 part as these concept are very important for the remaining part<br /><br />Part 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short run open economy (IS-LM-UIP model)<br />- considering trade, export and import to talk about part 2 again, while introducing new concepts like real depreciation, interest parity condition, flexible/fixed exchange rate<br /><br />Part 4: The medium run (AS-AD Model) CH. 6-7<br />- Discuss about the labor market, then the AS-AD model, and then AS-AD together with the IS-LM model<br /><br />Part 5: The long run (Solow model) CH 10-12.1<br />- interactions between output and capital. effects of saving rate on capital, output, and consumption. balanced growth...etc<br /><br />for me part 3 and 5 are the hardest, but many found part 4 the hardest. (maybe I dont have DSE econ so it confuse me less when new concepts that deviated from the dse syllabus are introduced)",

And I think she is able to explain the concept very very well. I dont have DSE econ and I still manage to catch up and understand most of the things during lesson. she at least tries to make the lesson more interactive by asking questions (you guess it: it ended up in silence almost every time). <br /><br />&quot;Do you understand the logic behind this?&quot;<br />&quot;Be sure that you are able to tell you grandpa and grandma about this concept&quot;<br /><br />you will probably hear these sentences every time you attend lesson. I guess she really wants to make sure that everyone understand everything she said lol. attending her lesson will be useful (at least for me). I attend every lesson before the long run part. I skipped most of the lesson in the long run part and I ended up spending most of my time revising this part for the final. <br /><br />She will use iprs to test if the class really understand everything (will talk about that on the &quot;grading&quot; part)<br /><br />overall, a very good professor, I give her a 9/10.<br /><br />TA - Jeremy <br />ok la - i personally found that the tutorial materials are much harder than the lecture material. He explaining things so fast but I totally understand that, cause he need to cram 3-hour lecture into 1-hour tutorial",

If you participate at least 9 of them you get full mark for this component. it doesn't matter if your answer is correct or not, even if the answer is wrong you will get the mark<br /><br />Problem set&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 in total, 3% each, people say she don't check the problem set, you will get the mark as long as you submit something. I didn't submit blank sheet or &quot;hea do&quot; the hw so I don't know if the above statement is right or wrong. trust me, do the problem seriously, it helps you with the concept. <br /><br />3 Quizzes&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />all 3 are an open book quizzes, do 20 questions in 30 minutes. You just do the quiz on canvas during lesson (btw no talking and discussion during the quiz). mean for all 3 quizzes are 15 over 20<br /><br />Mini project<br />you get to decide whether or not to do the project. If you do it, you will automatically switch to scheme 2 and you gain free 10%. 3 people each group, each group research on a certain topics/news on macroeconomics and present them after lesson. you will get 10% even if you just read from script or provide poor content. So I strongly encourage you to do this project. Its a free 10% to you. please register as soon as possible if you want to do the project cause there are only limited slot for the project<br /><br />Cumulative final exam<br />Way harder than the quizzes, it has MC, short question, and long question.<br />MC part: same difficulty as the quizzes <br />Short question: it ask you to fill in the blanks (decrease/increase/no change) first. then ask you to provide explanation in the the bottom. Something like this:<br /><br />&quot;suppose tax cut caused saving rate to decrease, In the long run, output ____________ (decrease/increase/no change) <br />explain:&quot;<br /><br />fill in the blanks isnt the hard part, explaining them is. you need to use diagram/flowchart to explain the concept really well to get full credit i guess<br /><br />long question: 2 questions in total. 1 quantitative one (need to do some algebra) and 1 drawing diagrams (no calculation needed)<br />the quantitative question is similar to the problem set. slightly easier (爆出黎D式冇problem set咁核突) then you need to explain the concept again about the equation<br />for the drawing diagram question, it was confusing af. she give you condition that will shift both AS and AD curve and ask you to use variables to explain whether it is a good policy or not. my diagram ended up full of lines.<br /><br /><br />Participation: 5/5<br />Problem Sets: 15/15<br />Quizzes: 29.25/30<br />Mini Project: 10/10<br />Final: 103/120 (Mean: 71.33/120, SD: 23.95)<br />Overall: 93.58%&nbsp;&nbsp;A+<br /><br />my first A+ in my university life :') so grateful",

You can expect to have the 'theoretical knowledge' of how the macro-economy works, but indeed it is very theoretical, and you could learn a lot more and much faster through Investopedia, YouTube etc. which actually gives real-life knowledge to understand the economy.<br /><br />If you're planning to take this as a Common Core, be sure to look at the in-depth Syllabus before hand to make sure you would like to study these topics in-depth, theoretically (not very interesting, in my opinion). As I said, online resources would be more helpful if you're looking to gain understanding on the economy, i.e. Ray Dalio: How the Economic Machine Works - an in-depth 30min video on YouTube about the general workings of the macro economy.<br /><br />Syllabus Outline:<br />=========================<br />Introduction (Chapters 1-2)<br />- Economy in the short run<br /><br />The Goods Market (Chapter 3)<br />- Financial Markets I (Chapter 4)<br />- Goods and Financial Markets: The IS-LM model (Chapter 5)<br /><br />Economy in the medium run<br />- The Labor Market (Chapter 7)<br />- Putting All Markets together (Chapter 7 of the 6th edition of the book)<br /><br />Open Economy<br />- Openness in Goods and Financial Markets (Chapter 17)<br />- The Goods Market in an Open Economy (Chapter 18)<br />- Output, the Interest Rate, and the Exchange Rate (Chapter 19)<br />- Exchange Rate Regime (Chapter 20*)<br /><br />Economic Growth*<br />- Facts of Growth (Chapter 10*)<br />- Saving, Capital Accumulation, and Output (Chapter 11*)<br />- Technological Progress and Growth (Chapter 12*)",

For the sake of your GPA, don't.<br /><br />The whole semester was a clown-fest, I will just list some important highlights of this Professor:<br />- Rescheduled the Midterm exam 5-6 times. Sent an email every time he changed the time. My inbox was filled with useless shit from him. His tone in his emails, obviously tells us that he is changing the time of the midterm every time a student sends him a message telling him there is a clash in the student's schedule. Why not wait until all the students with clashes email you, THEN make an appropriate, once-only change to the midterm date &amp; time?<br />- The midterm exam, was a blatant copy of the questions in HW1 (literally, the questions are the same, except a few changes (i.e. answer is opposite of the ones in HW1, or just a change of some wordings, but generally the same answer), and all MC questions were about contents in the Tutorial, with NOTHING from the Lecture Slides. Luckily I joined the tutorials, but I gave prayers for those who didn't.<br />- After the midterm, he decided to just record his lectures and post them on Canvas, meaning no live classes on Zoom. His live classes will be for 'Q&amp;A sessions'. This is acceptable since the semester was online and no one joins his lectures anyways. But oh dear, you can't get anything good out of this dude. The quality of his posted videos are max 540p, like you know, the quality of YouTube videos in 2007 - and not even considering the fact that there is a black box on a corner of his recorded videos.<br />- I kid you not, the day before the Final (at 12:30pm the next day), we had a Q&amp;A session at 8:30pm, meaning there is only one more night before the Final Exam. A student asked whether the questions would be similar to the midterm, whether he would just blatantly copy the questions in the homework and tutorials, but in&nbsp;&nbsp;a nice tone, perhaps not to aggravate the Professor who seemingly started the Zoom Q&amp;A with an 'I hate my life, mid-life crisis' face. He paused for 2 seconds before answering, and I quote, &quot;I have no clue what will be in the Final Exam because I haven't made the questions.&quot; Dead silence hung in the air. Some students with their camera open seemed to let off a little smirk. Let me tell you, it was hilarious as fuck, I laughed my ass off. 16 hours before the Final and the Professor has the audacity to tell the whole class, nonchalantly, that he HAS NOT STARTED PREPARING for the final exam?<br /><br />You can search this Professor up, he spent over a decade teaching at HKU, and this is his first semester in HKUST. For some reason he decided to move from HKU to HKUST... If I could make a wish come true, you know what it would be.",

I really tried hard to spend half of the semester to get used to his english but in veil, and realized that I should not have wasted my time to attend classes. It is just a waste of time.<br /><br />He did not explain well. Everything is just a mess. He just read out everything and then bullshit. Grammar is wrong, accent is strong. You just won't know what he is saying. <br /><br />The TA Ding Dong also has accent but at least he is really passionate in teaching. He answers your emails in less than 30minutes and he is willing to give extra hours for tutorials or additional teaching. He also gives out Starbucks coupons every tutorial lesson to attract us to class. Even if there is no incentives, it is quite worthy to attend too because he teaches wayyyyyyyy better than the professor with much thorough explanation.",

Many students will do the quizzes together and discuss answers but I do not suggest this because it wastes time and it is cheating!<br /><br />5) Final Exam (Closed Book)<br />The final is cumulative, so you need to study the whole course again! Long run is not included in the quizzes, therefore it counts more in the final exam.<br /><br />Don't spend too much time on one question! Because it has 15MC, 5-6 SQ and 2LQ.

Open economy<br /><br />To be honest, the concepts are not easy to understand, and revision outside lecture time is a must if you want to get a satisfaction grade. Even though I attend all the lectures, I cannot understand all the contents during lesson so need to spare some time after lesson in order to know what the professor said. Also, there are many equations that needed to be memorized which cheat-sheet is not allowed during both mid-term and exam. However, online quizzes will be posted when each topic have been taught. Make sure u finish them before the mid-term and final as some of them will be tested again. The &quot;Recap questions&quot; that professor showed during lesson would also be tested also, and try not to skip lessons as they are not included in the lecture slides given.<br /><br />However, personally, the contents of macroeconomics is more interesting than those in microeconomics.",

In QUIZLET, someone posted per chapter-questions and some of them appear in the midterm. I was saved.<br /><br />- Finals: … the mean is low and I totally get way. The final is definitely more difficult than the Midterm, with the essay and all that. MAKE SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE MEDIUM-TERM AND LONG-TERM MECHANISMS. One or two of the questions are applied knowledge so you have to do deeper thinking <br /><br />I got above mean for both so hehe. Just don't underestimate this course and cram. Being comfortable with the mechanisms is the key ( --&gt; how the demand other formula is formed is pretty intuitive after you understand the high-level thinking).

We were expected to memorize the equations and how they are derived (an equation sheet is given for the exams but it's unhelpful).",
            "comment_teaching": "Marc is more of a researcher than a professor. All of the reviews mention his accent, which I don't think is a big deal. The main issues lie in his teaching style, PowerPoint slides, and personality. <br /><br />Marc uses the Socratic method--the professor asks questions and calls on students to answer them instead of actually teaching on his own. After a month, only 8 students showed up to class because they realized it was a waste of time. When you ask him questions in class, he turns them onto the students to answer and never answers the question himself, so it can be hard to learn. If a student contradicts his teaching style, then he gets all defensive. Attendance isn't mandatory, but the lecture slides are intentionally left blank and he constantly contradicts the textbook, so don't plan to solely self-study. <br /><br />Marc isn't a bad person, he's just too caught up on his goal of being a difficult professor. When students tried to review their midterm with him, he told them that failure is a part of life that they need to get used to. Also, he said that he exams are graded on correctness but the exact answer that he is looking for (meaning you can have the correct answer, but you get 0 points). <br /><br />Every single person in my class despised his harshness and teaching style, so I was shocked to see the amount of positive reviews. Maybe he teaches more similar to how Eastern students learn rather than Western students. So if you are from Europe or the US, then I would seriously take another professor because the culture shock will be insane. <br /><br />I'm not bitter about my grade or Marc in any way, I just believe he is one of the worst professors at UST due to his teaching and testing policies and wished somebody had warned me about taking his course beforehand. This class literally made me start therapy, so please save yourself.",
            "comment_grading": "Honestly, the final grading for this course is really good (60% is like a B) but it's due to the insane curve. I got a B+, but thought I was going to get a D for most of the semester. <br /><br />The midterm and final exams are impossible to score above a 70% (the average on both was 50% with a s.d of about 14). The exams don't measure your knowledge of the subject and he frequently asks questions that were never discussed in class. The tests were the most disappointing aspects of the course because you couldn't showcase your knowledge. (I got a 5 on AP Macro, attended every lecture and tutorial, studied over 100 hours for the midterm exam, got a 90% on the practice exams, and my midterm grade was well below the average of 50%). <br /><br />Insider Tip: he loves making the answers to long mathematical derivations &quot;None of the Above&quot; or &quot;Not Enough Information is Given&quot;.",
            "comment_workload": "The graded workload isn't too much. The homework takes about 3-5 hours to complete, but it's impossible to do it alone. There's weekly reading which is extremely helpful to understand what is going on in class. <br /><br />However, the amount of studying that this course requires is insane and most students paid tutors to help them.

            "comment_content": "The content covers the fundamentals of macroeconomics, explaining the four components of AD then formulating the relationship between IS-LM and how it derives the AD curve. After the midterm, he covers AS and includes the factors that derive it such as the labor market, market for physical capital. Of course, these are just the main topics covered and there is more.<br /><br />Personally as someone who took IB Econ HL, I found myself relearning most of the content and found the course more quantitative and theoretical compared to the IB since there is a lot more focus on diagrammatical analysis (Not sure about DSE but I would assume it to be similar)<br /><br />The course content slightly differs from the textbook since his lecture slides are his own interpretations of Macro theories. Unless you are struggling to understand certain concepts, I wouldn't advise using textbooks to revise and instead, I would focus more on his slides and handouts. <br /><br />If you don't have a background in econ i.e. taking econ in high school/middle-school , it might be a bit harder for you to fully grasp the concepts (Well it depends but generally, having a bit of economic intuition is beneficial)",
            "comment_teaching": "His lecture slides are quite confusing since half of them are mathematical proofs of economic frameworks which won't be tested on the exam. This makes it hard to make notes.<br /><br />In addition, he provides some video recordings explaining certain theories which aren't on the lecture slides. Therefore, you can't just rely on the lecture slides to revise and you need to look at everything he's posted on canvas e.g. video recordings, extra slides he didn't go through during class, mark-schemes of Diagram applications not shown in the lecture slides etc...<br /><br />Furthermore, there were some topics that appeared on the lecture slides but weren't tested, especially the last topic on opened economy (IS-LM-BP Model). I was only informed about this in class as he did not make a public announcement.<br /><br />The TA notes and lecture notes are quite different since Professor Chi Wah uses his own interpretations and theories instead of textbook concepts. Aside for the midterm, I would advise you to only rely on the lecture slides to revise for the final exam. TA notes are redundant after the midterm because concepts taught by the TA slightly differs from the lecture slides and Chi Wah writes the exam papers.",

Completely. <br /><br />Yuen Chi Wa uses his own annotations that is different from your textbook. So you need to memorize what the annotations mean before you start learning, otherwise it will be a mess. <br /><br />His lecture notes is a mess. He loves to use symbols and calculations to show how good he is, but it is difficult for students to learn, compared to drawing graphs. You will not understand his lecture notes without attending his class. <br /><br />His midterm is the exact copy of the HW1. Didn't change anything. So anyone who have studied the case in HW1 gets almost full mark.<br /><br />He mentioned before final that, the open economy will only be tested in MC format because it is quite difficult. We assume there is only 10 questions, same as the midterm and last year's final, but eventually there are 20. Fuck my life.<br /><br />He held 2 Q&amp;A zoom sessions before the final, but he seemed very impatient and grouchy in the whole session. He kept urging the students who asked questions to refer to the lecture notes. So what is the point of the Q&amp;A sessions?&nbsp;&nbsp;He always has bad attitude and discourages students to learn better.",

So it does not take a lot of time, you can even group up to three people and work together.<br /><br />I did not spend a lot of time in the midterm and final, but I think it still take some time for you to understand the concepts especially if you did not attend the classes. However, the exams does not require you to understand those. You just need to memorize most of the cases and scenarios discussed in class, you can prepare cheat sheet as well. Easy.",

Closed economy will be examined first, followed by open economy in the short run. We will then move on to the labor market and put all three markets together to derive the AS-AD model in the medium run. Lastly, if time permits, we will further examine key aspects of economic growth in the long run. Altogether, the theoretical framework presented in this course will enable you to predict and analyze the impacts of government fiscal and monetary policies on the economy.

She can teach one slide about like fiscal policy for half an hour. She draws stuff (in great detail) onto paper and uploads them as handwritten notes. Sh also teaches much extra stuff that she thinks is interesting. She is a great teacher overall, given you have the heart to learn. <br /><br />On the other hand, it is more difficult to follow her class, as if you mess up with the logic, you cannot easily catch up. She teaches the first few classes in a horrible manner (no one knows what she is doing). She also cannot finish the syllabus (did not teach the whole long run) because she spent so much time elaborating on open market.<br /><br />Jenny uses calculus. Get prepared.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />FeiDing teaches very well in a different way. She explains concepts first, i.e. the big picture, and then moves on to explain some details. She does not go as detailed as Jenny. Instead, she explains in a more newcomer-friendly way and tries to get around tough contents. <br /><br />She often skips contents. Central bank money, J-curve, liquidity trap... are not in FeiDing's class but in Jenny's class. I think they are useful though...<br /><br />Anyways, this is a common core! I grabbed one of my friends in Jenny's class who suffered and he felt refreshed after FeiDing's class. <br /><br />By the way, FeiDing, Jenny and LuYang from econ3123 uses similar ppt, with different layouts (econ3123 will have different contents starting from chp6).

Not engaging whatsoever, she answers her own questions. I recall one lecture where she spent over 40 minutes talking about various currencies, and holding them up/passing it around for people to see.<br /><br />Additionally, what is taught in the class is the most basic version of the concepts. The homework is advanced, while the exam, well, let's just say, there's not much you can do. I went for a paper checking session after the exam, only to find out that the grading scheme was completely different to what she taught in class.<br /><br />Horrible experience to say the least.",

That said, though, if you are a quant person you would probably like his teaching style.<br /><br />While there are comments saying that his teaching is disorganised, I personally think that it was actually structured logically. He introduced the components of AD (goods market &amp; loanable funds market) for the first half of the course, and moved on to the components of AS (labor and capital markets) for the remaining half.<br /><br />One thing, though: he encouraged people to ask questions but he roasted them 90% of the time. My interpretation is that he doesn't like it when people:<br />1) ask something that is already on lecture slides<br />2) blabber for a whole damn minute and still couldn't get to the point - make up your mind before you ask<br />3) accuse him of not explaining something well enough or doubting the legitimacy of his teaching/materials<br /><br />So yea, make sure you know what you are asking.",

So after reviewing these cases, the professor decided to go through and re-graded all the papers by herself in order to be fair to all students.

I would watch the video in x1.5 instead of going to lectures, whenever I needed to go to lectures.<br /><br />Explanation<br />— His ppt is a bit too brief so it's hard to understand the concepts thoroughly just by reading his ppt. Therefore he emphasised that you NEED to read the textbook. I would say reading the textbook is the main source of concepts because it's really well written; lectures are just reinforcement. Notice though that he might include tested contents in ppt that are not in the textbook, so reading ppt is also crucial.<br />— In lectures, he briefly explains the ppt. Most value of the lectures lies in he answering students' questions, which clarifies a lot of students' common misunderstanding<br /><br />Resource<br />— 2 midterm practice (I guess they're past papers) <br />— 1 final practice paper (final paper from last year)<br /><br />Others<br />— there is no stupid project or other tedious stuff, which is really good for your learning<br />— does not take attendance and no participation, which is really good",

            "comment_grading": "I think it’s pretty decent.<br />There are two grading schemes. Grading depends on the highest between two.<br />Scheme 1:<br />Zoom Participation 7%<br />Problem Sets 4x2% each = 8%<br />Quizzes 3x10% each = 30%<br />Mini Project = 10%<br />Final = 45%<br />Scheme 2:<br />Zoom Participation = 7%<br />Problem Sets = 4x2% each = 8%<br />Quizzes = Best2x15% each = 30%<br />Mini Project = 0%<br />Final = 55%<br /><br />Basically, you will get a full in participation if you participate in 90% of classes (around 20). If you can’t meet this requirement, your mark will drop to 4% immediately. Prs are not counted in participation marks, so no worry if you accidentally fall asleep in class.<br />Problem Sets are marked based on efforts. So just try your best to answer all questions with steps will score you a full in PS.<br />Mini Project is a must must complete item in FeiDing’s class. Once you finish your presentation, a 10% full will be given unless you have a really poor poor performance. But the slots are limited, you will have to register a place in the first week and there’s around 57 places in one section. Be quick and a 10% will be automatically be in your pocket. If you choose to register mini project, I think your grading system will basically be Scheme 1.<br />Quizzes are in normal difficulty. All mc questions, but time is quite constrained. 25 minutes for 20 questions. So better revise more although it’s an open book quiz. Mean is around 80% (the last one&nbsp;&nbsp;is around 73) and I got slightly above mean in three quizzes. Only slightly.<br />Final is much more difficult. It’s cumulative and majority of the questions are from part 4, especially in long questions. Time is very limited again, 100 minutes for a lot of questions. So you really have to be quick. But the mean is relatively low. It’s only 103.75/240, not a half even. Just try your best to revise all lecture materials, and finish problem sets as well as practice paper in your own and you will be fine in the exam.<br />FYI<br />Quizzes - 25%/30% (Mean 23.3%)<br />Final - +1.45 s.d. <br />Just above 80% and it’s already an A grade. Pretty decent.<br />Most importantly, I only got a lv2 in DSE Economics, so just revise and practise and it would be fine.",
            "comment_workload": "I wouldn’t say it’s light, given that there are 4 problem sets, 3 quizzes and 1 final. But I think the time allowed for assignments is more than enough and you have a lot of time to revise before exams. So overall, it’s still appropriate in terms of workload.",
