        "description": "Fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence, robotic devices are envisioned to become an ubiquitous part of daily life. New technologies such as wireless communication, voice and visual understanding, and machine learning will enable the development of biologically-inspired cognitive humanoid robots. This course will give students with little or no technical background an enriched understanding about robots and how they will change society. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human-machine society will be identified and discussed. The learning process will be facilitated through demonstrative sessions, where students can observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of autonomous robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will focus on a specific social, business or technology issue based on their personal background and interest. Through experimentation with robot kits, they will identify and explore ways robotics and automation might impact our quality of life.",

(I REPEAT AGAIN: DONT TAKE THIS COURSE!!!)<br /><br />The professor required us to buy the textbook but he just used some articles to let us do the synopsis (2 homework). I think it is a waste of money because I supposed he would discuss the content with us, but he didn't.<br /><br />Midterm is a report and you can do it at home. The format is like IES which means you need to follow the guiding questions. You need to find the references on your own because the lectures can't help you at all.<br /><br />The biggest irony is that you learn nothing about mechanical engineering, but your ability for reading comprehension and rephrasing will be improved significantly after finishing the homework. That's why I said this course should be called LANG1903 instead of MECH 1903.<br /><br /> For the final, it is a group project, which is making a 'robot' by VEX kits.

The aim of the robot is up to you. Lots of freedom. You don't need to make the robot moving by itself. Just do some simple prototype is okay.",
