            "comment_content": "You will love this course if and only if you love programming in C++.<br /><br />This course is a paradise for those who love programming, especially in C++. This course provides almost all knowledge about basic C++ programming, from basic procedural programming to advanced OO design (e.g abstract classes, templates). On the other hand, it is tedious for those who have less programming experience or little interest in programming. There are tons of material covered in a single semester: 21 sets of slides not counting the extras.<br /><br />The course materials are extremely well prepared. They explain the concepts clearly. There are lots of examples provided and Desmond will cover some extra ones in class. The materials suffice for those aiming for a satisfactory understanding and good enough score in exams. I personally found that not enough and I spent lots of time reading cppreference.com . <br /><br />IMO, this course should be renamed to &quot;Honors C++ Programming and Applications in Data Structures&quot;. It's more about the OO programming in C++ instead of introducing the OO paradigm.",
            "comment_teaching": "Desmond, I know you will read the comments here.<br />I just want to say. You are a really cool guy indeed.<br /><br />Desmond spent lots of time covering the little details and some fun corner cases. It is understandable that not everything can be covered in class and many cases are missing. :P Nevertheless, it really motivates me to dig deep into the C++ standards and appreciate the beauty of C++. Why the language is designed in a way that this case causes an error but not another?<br /><br />I remember Desmond told me about the g++ compiler not following the standard. One of them is about defining templated operator both in-class and out-of-class (and the operator is called). I thought, is it really the case? Although I did not find out the standard incompliance, I found a really interesting thing. g++ warns about not compliant to ISO C++ standard if the non-templated operator is defined both in-class and out-of-class, but it is not the case when the operator is templated. The latter case is indeed compliant to standard! That is a function template overloading, which the in-class definition is more specialized than the out-of-class one, so it won't be ambiguous when the operator is called. :O<br />(Maybe I will later write a little snippet and attach it here, but I believe no one would be interested :P)<br /><br />Desmond is famous for his timely reply of emails and interesting teaching style, so I won't repeat too much in this review. He also explains the concepts clearly with easy to understand examples. But most importantly, he is really good at maintaining a good learning atmosphere so you want to constantly learn more.<br /><br />tl;dr Desmond AA AAA! (in Desmond tone)<br /><br />Also, I would like to thank Bing Yen, who is the TA of my lab session. He is a nice guy to talk with! He did his undergrad in UST and is a quite knowledgeable person. You can discuss nearly anything about 2012H or even about some of your other courses. He prepared the materials quite well, and the tasks are interesting (like the chess in PA4, you can play chess with him too!). Most importantly, he gives good grades :P<br /><br />I didn't get in touch very often with the other two TAs and the materials (assignments &amp; graders) are not prepared that well. I believe they are both nice guys. I want to thank Guangneng who patiently listen to my explanations and give me back 2 points in exam checking despite I wrote long and messy codes for the LCA.",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is really bad because I deserve more than an A+.<br />Anyway, the scheme is extremely lenient among most UST course. It is definitely a good GPA saver.<br /><br />The assessment consist of 4 components:<br />Programming Assignments (PA) 4*7% = 28 %<br />Programming Project (PP) 12%<br />Labs 10%<br />Midterm 20%<br />Final 30%<br />(I will leave the details in workload review)<br /><br />You can get full scores in labs, assignments and programming project as long as you pay effort. The quantity is high but not the difficulty. There are tons of bonus that guarantee you a full score if you work hard. The midterm is not that difficult considering this is an honor course. The exam is pretty tricky though (just tricky, still doable), you have to be really careful to get a good score.<br /><br />My score:<br />PA1 - 91.54/100 (Mean: 93.8)<br />PA2 - 110/100 (Mean: 87.8)<br />PA3 - 84/75 (Mean: 70.3)<br />PA3 (doc) - 25/25 (Mean: 24.4)<br />PA4 - 115/100 (Mean: 95.9)<br />PA subtotal: 425.54/400 =&gt; 28/28 (capped at 28%)<br />PP: 100/100 (Mean: 88.7) =&gt; 12/12<br />Labs: 28/24 =&gt; 10/10 (capped at 10%)<br />Midterm: 92.5/100 (Mean: 74.4, SD: ~12.9, Max: 97) =&gt; 18.5/20<br />Final: 87.75/100 (Mean: 67.1, SD: ~14.46, Max: 87.75) =&gt; 26.325/30<br />Overall: 94.825/100 =&gt; A+<br /><br />My score statistic is not really that useful for judging the grading scheme, but I heard from my friends that they got really good grades despite their bad performance in exam/midterm.<br /><br />One of them got about half sd below mean in midterm and mean in final. Got an A-. One of them got about ~75 in final (10+ person got 80+), still got an A+. For reference, attached is the score distribution of midterm and final.<br /><br />btw, I got 90+ in my midterm. Desmond, where is my 5.0?<br />&quot;Ninety something is more than an A+. We should give you 5.0. ...... 講真㗎喎 你唔駛攞90幾分先攞A+㗎 你攞90幾分可以俾5分你㗎啦 我直頭要捽咗你個CGPA寫個5字落去&quot;<br />(Extracted from 16 Oct 2018 Lecture, Desmond was talking about the mean score of previous 2012 midterm exams)<br /><br />I really need this 5.0...... I failed badly in other courses :C",
            "comment_workload": "Just a fair warning: if you don't fully enjoy programming, you will hate the workload (and the whole course). <br /><br />I would rate the workload A if this course changed to 8 credits. <br /><br />For me, a relatively experienced programmer in competitive programming (I have used C++ as my primary programming language for 4 years) and a team member of HKUST programming team, the workload is just at the right level, barely manageable in other words. I have to spend lots of time in this course despite my good programming background. <br /><br />There are a total of 4 PAs, 1 PP and 8 Labs. Labs won't take much of your time (~1 hr workload each) but the assignment and the project are quite heavy.<br /><br />The first PA is sudoku, a very easy and standard recursion task. It takes only a few hours to finish but I didn't pay attention to the handling of small case alphabets and got below mean......<br /><br />PA2 is about a weird doubly link list stock system (it is quite like persistent data structures). I tried to speedrun PA2, it took me about 7.5 hours of continuous work. Even more time is used for writing test cases and stress testing to debug the program. I also found the bug in the demo program which I spent some time typing up emails explaining to Desmond and TAs about the situation. <br />(I believe stress testing and writing test cases are overkill, the grader grades on simple cases anyway)<br /><br />PA3 was released near midterm, it's a pipes game. I finished the programming part fairly quickly but the documentation part was a nightmare. I spent about one to two days time (not including breaks) to type up a 23 pages (about 5k words) report explaining everything in the program, glad Desmond extended the deadline by 2 days.<br /><br />PA4 is chess. It took me about 13 hours to complete the program and an extra 5 hours for the full 10 points bonus. Although it took much longer than PA2, working on this is way more fun and less frustrating as you can test play it while coding.<br /><br />Regarding the project, you have to form a team of 2-3 ppl and propose a topic by yourself. The workload depends on how far you want to accomplish. You don't need to work really hard to get a good score, it is more like your personal aim instead of grades. I spent hours and hours on the project because I enjoy working on it. You can look at the commit history for details. But really, I hate documenting it...... I spent two days seating at LC working from 9 to 9 writing docs for each function using doxygen.<br /><br />In case anyone is interested in our project, here's the link:<br />https://github.com/STommydx/photo-editing-software<br /><br />Although the project got graded, I sometimes will work on fixing some bugs or on some new minor features (just for fun). So, feel free to report bugs or even open PRs ;)<br /><br />Protip: Image Processing is a good topic if graded by Desmond (he said he would give 20 points bonus!)<br />(利申: graded by Bing Yen but not Desmond)<br /><br />Aside from lecture and time spent on labs and assignment, I also spent a lot of time reading cppreference.com and testing extra programs by myself. I didn't count how much time I spent. Just a reference, most of the links of the C++ language in cppreference are deep blue after the semester. <br /><br />The workload is demanding but rewarding. I did learn a lot while I went through all the assignment and project madness. <br /><br />Just a final note, I wrote up many snippets to help myself (and my friends) to clear the concepts. I thought I better not waste it and post it here :)<br /><br />C++ Exercise (covers a lot of tricky cases not mentioned in lecture):<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1788807<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1788814<br /><br />Arrays &amp; Function parameters (extends from a case Desmond mentioned in lecture):<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1776698<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1776751<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1776862<br /><br />Constructing Binary Trees with Pre-order &amp; In-order Traversal using BST (a weird but interesting solution for lab 8):<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1784383<br /><br />Lambda closure type (have you ever thought of the type of lambda? can they be copied?):<br />https://gitlab.com/snippets/1776478",

His slides are god awful — incomprehensible, ancient, with errors all over.<br /><br />More egregious is his utter lack of concern for the effectiveness of any aspect of the course. Quan only gives lectures. Labs are out of his purview. Assignments are out of his purview. Exams are out of his purview. In fact, he hadn't laid eyes on the midterm paper before we were done with midterm. This inevitably led to a total disconnect between teaching, and testing — we were grossly unequipped to do well in the exams, whose purpose seems to be to differentiate those that are proficient C++ programmers from those that aren't.

Additionally, if you wish to do the bonus tasks, you will often spend more time on them than the core tasks.<br /><br />Despite this, I think the workload is smaller than Desmond's 2012H, but only by a small margin. It's still the insane workload you expect from this course.<br /><br />If future iterations of 2012H are like this, my suggestion is to do the PAs as soon as they're released, which is 2.5 weeks before they are due. This way, you won't have to stress about them the day they are due, and gives you some leeway in case of unforseen events or if the PA is unexpectedly difficult. (I'm looking at you, PA9...)<br /><br />Moreover, you have to look at it contextually... COMP2012H is usually taken by CS students in their Year 2 fall semester. In this semester, they will also take a linear algebra course, COMP2711(H), and LANG2030(H). These courses are also difficult for many students. Together with 2012H, it makes for an extremely high-workload semester.",

Also, he is quite approachable both before and after class, so ask questions if you have any.<br /><br />The TA team in general is quite good as well. Although some of the assignment descriptions or the sample program may have issues, they responded to them promptly. They are also quick to reply emails (especially when you need to appeal PA multiple times due to compilation errors) and are active on Piazza. <br /><br />Overall, the entire teaching team is enthusiastic in teaching and answering any queries you might have.<br /><br />Note: Lab sections are taught by TAs to cover additional topics, unlike COMP 2011/2012's labs which take attendance.

I doubt more than 10 students finished the paper in the tight time limit.<br /><br />Update: The teaching team added 10 marks per person for the final exam for &quot;effort&quot;, but still no one had a score above 100.

Mean is B while UQ is A+, which makes me wonder how the grades in the middle are given. <br /><br />Note that the mean is ~6 total marks below median, similar to the gap from median to UQ.<br /><br />It has been confirmed that around 50% of the class got an A range.",

Weekly programming assignments are challenging to complete (although there are 2.5 weeks per assignment, the assignments are released weekly, and you really do not want to be behind schedule for them). Not to mention the bonus that you might want to work on.<br /><br />Ask yourself these questions before taking this course: <br />Is it necessary for you/ interesting for you, or are you simply here for the grades? Note that you can take COMP 2011 in Year 1 Spring and COMP 2012 in Year 2 Fall to satisfy the same requirements at the same time for COMP/CPEG/COSC (and if you can do well in this course, you can likely do well enough to get A ranges in both COMP 2011 and COMP 2012). The grading you get here might be lenient, but not as good as 8 credits of As.<br /><br />Do you have prior programming experience (preferably in an OOP language)? It is almost mandatory for you to have some, as COMP 1021 is definitely not sufficient for you to survive in this course (unless you are a genius).<br /><br />Are you motivated enough to work *extra* hard throughout the semester? The workload is not trivial and you are advised to do every programming assignment when it's released. Do not deadline fight these or you will definitely be in trouble. Also, consider taking a reduced credit load (&lt;= 15 credits). I took 18 credits this semester and the workload is immense. Taking COMP 2011 and COMP 2012 means that you can have more time to strengthen your foundations and have a better experience overall.<br /><br />I'm not trying to dissuade you from trying this course - quite the contrary.

It is also one of the few courses with a genuinely interesting lab session, as you learn command line as well as how to use emacs, two skills that I am still using regularly in other courses to streamline my workflow. Great allround course.",

The exams can be a little tricky, but if you have done the assignments fully you will have most likely faced the same situations that are shown in the exam.",

These will take significant planning and because the assignments build on each other, you might find that halfway through assignment 5 you have a major design bug from assignment 1, causing you to have to rewrite major parts of the code. If you are not that interested in programming or are already taking a heavy workload, you should really check wether you can commit to this or not.",

He demonstrated the concepts with examples in detail and kindly reminded us the important parts (prof: &quot;If I were you, I would circle it and draw three stars around this keyword!&quot;). Also, he is very talkative, easy-going, and a great listener to students' needs. Extension of deadlines is negotiable. He did a great job in creating an interactive and comfortable learning atmosphere in spite of our lectures conducted via Zoom. He encourages us to rethink the purpose of every line of code and logic behind the usage of data structures when approaching a problem.<br /><br />I was amazed by his enthusiasm from his welcoming emails (3 emails about additional C++ concepts on average per week). He is very responsive to emails and questions during classes. Just write him emails or interrupt him politely during class to clear your doubts if you have any. <br /><br />For the TAs, Bing Yen and Peter have been really responsive to email/meeting requests as well. Sometimes, the task description of lab and assignments are not that clear but make sure you ASK THEM ASAP!<br /><br />From group projects, students also get to learn a lot not only from the talented/hard-working peers but also practical usages of C++!",
            "comment_grading": "Prof. said roughly 50% of students get A range and he rarely gives a C range.<br /><br />Do the past papers at least 1 week before the exam. Learning resources are abundant but they require time to digest.<br /><br />Review the concepts right after class/on the same day, and start working on lab. Don't be ddl fighters!",
            "comment_workload": "Tremendously heavy, more than I expected, probably because all the reviews here were written by students who have already learned OOP/are talented/are passionate about programming. <br /><br />I recommend students learn C++ in advance. (I regret that I did not spent more weeks during my summer to finish up all the online C++ lecture videos of Stanfxxd CS106B...) Also, I advise that students should know their learning capacity well. Otherwise, students might end up struggling like me: <br /><br />- PAs: <br />I spent at least 1.5 weeks on average to finish PA1, 2, 3. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish PA4. <br />- Labs:<br />I spent at least 3 days on average to finalize each lab submission. Minimum time spent to submit one lab is 5 hours. Lab works were easier when the semester was coming to an end.<br />- The 3 holidays (National Day of PROC, the day following the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double 9th) are my saviors. Otherwise, I might beg for deadline extension for every hw submission...<br /><br />Honestly, as a student who studies in a non-CS major and is probably not talented enough to take this course without prior OOP coding experience, I think COMP2011 + COMP2012 probably would be better in terms of the learning experience. <br /><br />Of course there are people who are talented enough to pick up concepts easily without prior experience in OOP programming, but just make sure you know your strengths and limits before taking this course.

I spent over 1 week to debug my program, even then I still couldn't get full mark. There are many hidden test cases which will fuck up your program. However, this PA is a good training to your intuition in data structures and algorithms. (You were taught an algorithm for solving the minesweeper game, and you need to translate the algorithm into C++ language).<br /><br />PA2: proof assistant<br />Even today I still don't understand what the fuck is happening in this assignment. Basically you need to write a program that prove logical expressions (the one you learn in COMP2711). It uses some abstract data structures to manage the input/output. I am very bad at math and just follow the instructions and somehow I was able to finish this assignment.<br /><br />PA3: a mini turn based game<br />This one is quite straight forward, you just make use of OOP techniques and write a mini game. The test cases are pretty obvious and intuitive, therefore many people get full mark in this assignment.<br /><br />PA4: GUI version of PA3<br />Self-learn Qt and then turn your PA3 into a GUI version. At first it was difficult (learning Qt from scratch), but after picking up the basics, you will finish it in no time. (I spent first 3-4 days looking at the documentations, got confused (finish 10%). When I realize what was happening, I spent 1-2 days to finish the whole program(finish remaining 90%))<br /><br />The group project is about making a program with GUI (games or minitools or anything you like). Desmond said that the project is not competitive (everyone got decent grade). Depending on what you are trying to make, the project may take 3 days to 2 weeks+ to finish.",

            "comment_teaching": "Desmond is an epic guy; he tries to be funny in class to keep you awake, and he will not be annoyed if you send him many emails to ask things. He is very passionate about teaching. He will even reply to emails on weekends. And he will prepare many supplementary notes on his website, which are very useful for revision. The last time I met someone this passionate about teaching was in secondary school.<br /><br />He talks a bit slow, thought, so for the latter half of the semester I skipped his lessons and watched the videos at 2x speed, which is more efficient (for me), since I can't focus during the real time lessons anyway and would start playing with my phone or something. (sorry, Desmond!)<br /><br />Definitely take this course just to know Desmond. He is the most epic professor you will ever see in UST. Even though taking both COMP2011 and COMP2012 would be better for your GPA (if you can get A in COMP2012H you can probably get A in 2011 and 12), I recommend taking this course just for the epic learning experience.<br /><br />The TAs, Bingyen and Peter, are also epic. They will respond to your emails promptly.<br /><br />Bingyen is very lenient with grade appeals. For my PA1 I originally got 0 marks because I implemented a very stupid loop which takes 3 minutes to complete and caused the grading system to timeout. Since technically it should work, Bingyen approved it and I got 14/20. Then, I completely rewrote part of my code to get another 4 marks, and Bingyen approved my appeal again, bringing my score up to 18/20. Even though I did spend a lot of time fixing my code and&nbsp;&nbsp;I stuck to my original approach instead of copying from the solution, Bingyen is pretty epic for approving my appeal.<br /><br />Peter is also epic, one time I was struggling with a lab and I emailed him for help, and he told me to send him my code and he immediately pointed out the mistake.<br /><br />So, the whole teaching team is very nice and professional, I would give them A++!!!!",

But I think my score should be close to the A+ cut-off, so it was a close call. I thought I was going to get an A, so I mind-blown when I received an email from Desmond saying I got an A+. Yes, he sends you an email telling you what grade you got, which shows how epic he is.<br /><br />I though I screwed up my finals for sure. I had 3 essays to finish during the last week of lessons and we only had 3 days of study leave, so I ended up with only 2.5 days to study for the finals.<br /><br />I also made some dumb mistakes during the finals, like spelling val as value, capitalization, etc. which costed me at least 5 marks. I also forgot to insert one value in the question about AVL tree which costed me 6 marks. The canvas exam was a bit awkward. 2 of the the questions gave you a header file and asked you to implement the functions. You had to keep scrolling up to see the main question then scroll down to the test boxes. It would have been a good idea to write down the details of the given classes like the data members on a piece of paper so you don't need to keep scrolling up and down.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not very epic. It is two 4 credit courses squeezed into one. Taking more than 10 credits with COMP2012H (so 15 credits in total for the semester) is a huge mistake, as I found out. I took 18 credits and nearly worked myself to death. I was walking up 8am and working until 11pm every day for the entire semester.<br /><br />The labs took me around 6 hours each, and the PAs took around a couple days to a whole week to finish. If you are an epic genius you may spend less time.<br /><br />PA1 (minesweeper solver) was a nightmare. I spent more than a week on it. I also decided to be a smart ass and used loop instead of recursion, which resulted in my program timing out (see above) and a lot of trouble with fixing my code and appealing. Don't be a smart ass like me. Recursion is good, recursion is very healthy for your sanity.<br /><br />PA2 (proof assistant) was slightly better. I made a careless mistake which caused my program to fail for a special test case and costed me some points though. So, try to consider all the test cases.<br /><br />PA3 and 4 (turn based war game) were better. There were no insane special test cases you need to consider. If your program produces the correct output then you're done. However, the amount of coding to be done is massive, so I still spent a couple days on each.<br /><br />The group project gave me PTSD. I unintentionally kind of free-rided it. My groupmates started working on it 2 weeks before the deadline without telling me. After finishing PA4 I decided to start working on it (it was 1 week before the deadline) and I found the code 50% completed. So I freaked out and was worried that I was going be considered a free-rider and get a mark penalty. Well, I tried my best to contribute in the last week and we eventually got a ~95%, so I can't complain.<br /><br />Edit: you can find one of my groupmate's review here. I'm the bad teammate that he mentioned who proposed features when the deadline is near. Well, according to his review he got an A and I got an A+, so who is laughing now? *evil cackle*",

You should finish the lab exercise before attending the lab as you may require some more time in some lab exercises.<br />For the programming assignment, that would take a bit more time, but normally you can code it in 1~2 afternoon and debug it in 1 afternoon (about 1~2 FULL day) if you know what you are doing and have the energy to do it. Do not wait until the last moment.<br />The workload of the project really depends on your requirements, your topic, and your groupmates. Find good teammates, fix your requirements, and you should be good to go.",

Hash performance<br /><br />Of course these are only the go-to topics, and there are a lot of stuff that goes between, like &quot;order of construction and destruction&quot;, or &quot;rvalue reference and move semantics&quot;. So as you can imagine, the course content is dense with little room to breathe (for beginners). That said, the &quot;H&quot; in the course code meant that the course has a certain expectation.<br /><br />Also, did you know that you can just log in to https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012h with a valid CSD account to see for yourself, even if you aren't enrolled? I used to find that amusing.<br /><br />Anyway, if you could write *correct* C and debug by yourself, and have the patience to read through all 100+ answers on a Stack Overflow question to sieve for the gold, chances are that maybe the course materials wouldn't be that alien after all. Maybe it would make sense. Maybe you would even find enlightenment in learning how things actually work.",
            "comment_teaching": "Honestly, I didn't really go to lectures that much, because I already knew most of the stuff written on the lecture notes, thanks to Stack Overflow. But Gary's teaching is definitely not bad. I didn't feel that bored listening to his lecture despite having already known most of stuff, so there's that.<br /><br />During breaks, a lot of students came up to ask him questions, and he seemed passionate to answer, and particularly didn't mind indulging himself into confusing warnings and errors thrown by the compiler.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is different than COMP2011 and COMP2012, so it's difficult to judge. The graded test cases are all hidden and the visible ones do not count towards the score, so even though the all weekly assignments weighted 65%, it still takes effort and is not very possible to get full marks (unless you exhaust all input possibilities or prove your code is correct with math, idk). The final weighted 35% and imo is also hella difficult. Bonus might provide &quot;fine grade adjustments&quot; but I never know what it meant. My guess is you will probably get A range if you hit mean or above.",
            "comment_workload": "This is a course that worths 5 credits, so go figure. The weekly assignments are a massive burden: even if I know how to do it, it still takes a lot of time for me to debug and sanity check. Plus, no one writes completely correct code straight from the start. The tasks are naturally time-consuming.<br /><br />But what is even more burdening are the people that finish the assignment within the starting day and actively ask the lecturer for more difficult work, in turn for extra bonus. I guess this course not only takes a toll on your free time, but also on your mental wellbeing.",

I could feel that he really wants to teach us something useful, and is willing to help us in learning.<br /><br />Although this course covers materials of 2 courses, the teaching speed is actually moderate. Demond spends much time on reviewing previous lectures and teaching code examples. What makes it possible to cover all the materials is time (discussed in the workload section).<br /><br />What I like most about Desmond is that he is always there to help. He would stay for 30-60 minutes after each lecture answering questions and always reply emails with most detailed explanation. <br />Besides, he sends quite a lot of emails to further elaborate topics in classes, usually with code examples. So you can definitely learn much more as you want to.",
            "comment_grading": "I hesitated on this section but finally gave an A, because the grading is actually very fine, as promised by Desmond - I got an A- with a overall grade slightly below mean, which means that over half of the students are in A range.<br /><br />What makes me hesitate is that people in this course are all experts with A or above grades in introductory programming courses, so everyone deserves a good grade. And the grading scheme is also kind of unsatisfactory. Almost everyone gets nearly full marks in PAs and labs, and the group project grades have a very small SD, but the final exam is quite difficult and super tight in time. Therefore, your overall grade almost merely depends on your final exam, although it only counts 36% of the total grade.",

However, since we only have 8 lab tasks, almost all the rest labs are used to deliver lectures. Moreover, Desmond just loves his job TOO much and is always willing to offer additional classes. We've got 5 or 6 additional lectures this semester, each of THREE hours.<br /><br />Apart from lectures, we also have 8 lab tasks - each costs you several hours, 4 PAs - each can take up 1-3 days and even more on debugging, and a group project - takes around 1 week if you do want to be good.<br /><br />However, somehow, I still found the workload to be moderate because I really enjoyed the PAs and the project. Therefore, take this course only if you are really interested in programming, or you certainly get frustrated.",

This course adopts absolute grading!!<br />Grading is good since the course adopts absolute grading. Also, Desmond promised us that he will try not to give C-range or below.

The first few labs are quite interesting as they are making a game. But for the later ones, it gets more boring since they are just data structure manipulations.<br /><br />For PAs, it is expected to be harder than labs. You may want to take more time and focus on more on them. For later PAs, you may take even more time since you have to make use of GUI programming. In this course, we use Qt for GUI programming.<br /><br />For the group project, this is pretty much depending on your teammates. Even though your teammates should be good at programming since you need A/A+ in COMP introduction courses, there can be some bad teammates, too. Remember, never propose and add more features to your project a few days before the deadline!",

Some basic data structures, some are relatively difficult to learn, but still, Desmond will explain everything clearly to you.<br /><br />Topics Covered:<br />- Introduction to computer programming<br />- Fundamentals of C++: data types, variables, operators<br />- Flow controls<br />- Arrays<br />- Functions, scope, and recursion<br />- File I/O<br />- Pointers<br />- lvalue references<br />- Structures<br />- Class, object construction, iniitalization, and destruction<br />- Inheritance and polymorphism<br />- Generic programming<br />- Standard Template Library (STL)<br />- Static data members and member functions<br />- rvalue references and move semantics (excluded in exam)<br />- Linked lists<br />- Stack and queue<br />- Binary search tree<br />- AVL tree<br />- Hashing",

            "comment_workload": "Oh, that's really heavy. This is 5-credit course and everyone is excellent, so that they perhaps made everything harder.<br /><br />Labs are relatively easier, but some of them still have long codes and you need to FULLY UNDERSTAND the requirement and know exactly what you need to do, which is really really really important!<br /><br />Assignments include long codes and are really difficult. <br />PA1 is about using recursion to build and solve Minesweeper game. 0.5~1 weeks required.<br />PA2 is a mini-tool for prove(sth. in COMP2711) and this one is really difficult and tricky, as you'll encounter countless memory leakage, and it takes a long time for you to understand each instructions' meanings, as the description is not clear, you need to try on demo program yourself. 2~2.5 weeks required.<br />PA3 is a game, relatively easy, aiming at letting you get familiar with OOP. 0.5~1 weeks required.<br />PA4 is PA3's game with GUI. This one is difficult as well, as nothing about Qt is taught during class, so that you need to read documents and do google on your own. GUI is nothing like what you've done with C++ before, so you need to work hard. 1.5~2 weeks required.<br /><br />For the group project, you need to submit a proposal first and it'll be assessed by teaching team, after which you'll receive feedback of your idea.<br />The program of group project is a hard time. Get prepared to spend days and night on programming and debugging it. After submitting your code, your group need to do a presentation and explain your usage of OOP/Datastructures and your game's features to Desmond, Bing Yen and Jingyang.<br /><br />Final exam is difficult and the time is not enough. All you can do is fully understand what Desmond taught during class and understand all labs. Problems cover OOP, Data Structures, in lecture slides and labs. NO COMP2011 knowledge has been tested directly in final exam this time. (But there was before)",

The stuff after pointer is a bit more complicated, but it is nothing you can't understand as long as you pay attention in lectures and do review properly.<br /><br />Really glad to have met a group of peers who are enthusiastic about programming and hungry to learn more. Sometimes I was surprised by what they asked during or after classes, which pushed me to think deeper and harder. The experience was so great that I would say this course is worth taking even if I got a C.",

But for the final exam, I got about mean+1.3sd, and got A+ at the end. There was no midterm this semester. <br /><br />One thing to notice. We used ZINC, an automatic grading system, for submitting and grading labs and PAs this semester. Usually, each task had several test cases, and for each test, it is either full mark or zero. For PA2 I made a mistake for one single task and failed 7 tests, costing me 20+ marks. So it won't hurt to be really careful and check every task thoroughly(maybe by writing and running your own test cases) before the latest submission.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is quite heavy since it squeezes the content for two courses in one. If you haven't learned c++ before like me, think of it as an 8 credits course. I spent around half a day for each lab. For PAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;it really depends. You could fill the skeleton code in one or two days and spend twice the time debugging (for PA2, I spent a whole week). It is a great idea not to take too many tough courses during the same semester and start doing each PA as early as you can.",

Actually the workload for each PA is quite varied, I spent 3 days for the first PA, and spent a week to check with the demo program(they offer demo program so that you can check with the IO). PA2 is the worst PA, because you need to use recursion and check memory leak. And most of ppl fk up with this PA(the mean is 7x%). The remaining two is easy, I just spent half of a day to finish:)<br /><br />Project: If you don’t have prior experience on GUI Programming / doing programming project, I will recommend you to learn QT and do it early, otherwise you will deadline fight for that. For project presentation, I think they expected to be overran, but I will suggest you don’t bullshit to much on your product demo, demonstrating OOP skills and data structure are the most important thing.<br /><br />Final Exam: Start revision early and make sure you understand how to implement those data structure. I’m sure that some of you have experiences on programming, so you may feel easy for COMP2011 content. But the exam is not just asking you OOP skills, but also data structure. And you may be required to implement any data structure during the exam. And those questions are tricky so make sure you do all past paper especially COMP2012 and COMP2012H.",

But still, it took me about 3 full days to finsh and debug this PA. I think people who didn't know git might suffered more. You can also tell from the mean that this PA had the lowest mean score due to its difficulty. Also this PA had a bonus part which was to consider the 2nd parent when finding LCA. Anyway, you may refer to https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012h/assignments/PA2/Description/ if you are interested in the details of this PA. The idea was that the maximum possible points you may get from this PA was 110/100, or 8.8/8 in terms of the overall grade. and the extra 0.8% will be added to your total PA scores. But the maximum PA score you may get is 32% (4*8%) This arrangement helped me make up for the mistake I made in PA1)<br /><br />Programming assignment - PA3\t8%<br />mean: 86.48/100<br />me: 100/100<br /><br />Programming assignment - PA4\t8%<br />mean: 95.41/100<br />me: 100/100<br /><br />Programming project - PP\t24%<br />mean: 94.03/100 sd:8.05<br />my group: 96.25/100<br />(We didn't use many fancy datastructures and got plenty of mark deduction in that part.)<br /><br />Laboratory exercises\t8%<br />The scheme is max(lab1,lab2) * 2% + max(lab3,lab4)*2% + max (lab5,lab6)*2% + max(lab7,lab8) * 2%. So you only need to do full marks in four labs. I don't have statistics for the scores, but I believe everyone gets full marks since there are no hidden test cases like PAs. <br /><br />Final examination\t36%<br />mean: 65.87/100<br />me: 71/100<br />the score distribution can be found at https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012h/ &quot;Exam&quot; section<br />(&quot;The final exam is not something easy to deal with!&quot;, said Desmond during lecture. And indeed he didn't lie. The questions were very tricky especially the T/F questions, I did terrible at those:(. Make sure you pay attention to all edge cases mentioned in the lectures)<br /><br />overall: approximately ~88.6%<br />grade : A<br />I do know someone who was 0.9% overall higher than me got an A+. ( I guess I was cutoff by the &quot;natrual cutoff&quot;) :&lt;<br /><br />I tried to estimate my grade right after the exam score were releases according to previous reviews that come with statistics, and I think the cut off this year is very close to 2020-2021 Fall",
