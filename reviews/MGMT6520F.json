        "description": "Scenario planning is a method of identifying risks that emerge from ‘weak signal events’ that occur almost as much as strong predictions. The course objectives will be to develop an overview of business opportunities created by the implementation of scenario planning in a range of different industry sectors and assess the appropriateness of using scenario planning compared with other longer term strategic and leadership concepts. The course will place emphasis on pragmatic, innovative and experiential methods of teaching whilst also highlighting the array of perspectives and approaches that exist within scenario planning.",
