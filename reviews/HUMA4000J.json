        "description": "This course aims to provide an opportunity for students to conduct independent research - either individually or in small groups of 2-3 - on an issue of identity relating to oneself or the community at large. This course may be a continuation for students who have taken HUMA2280 or HUMA3200 previously and desire to conduct more in-depth research project on an issue related to identity, be it racial, cultural, ethnic, gender, social, political, or personal. Throughout the course, comprehensive guidance will be provided on reviewing key academic theories and concepts on identity studies, conducting fieldwork, analyzing research findings and drawing conclusions. Key figures or leaders of identity studies or politics will be invited to speak to students and provide additional comments and advice on the students' projects. Students who have taken other higher-level HUMA courses, are familiar with topics of global identity studies, or have had previous experiences with conducting a term research project in the field of humanities or social science may also enroll upon the instructor's permission.",
