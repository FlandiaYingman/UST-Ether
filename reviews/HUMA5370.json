        "name": "Animation Theories",
        "description": "Animation existed as optical toys long before the birth of cinema, but it was not until the digital age that animation experienced its explosive boom. Recently animation theories began to emerge as a new field of research, offering critical interventions in film studies and even challenging our conventional views of the world. This course explores various theoretical issues in animation studies, such as movement, stasis, affect, automation and agency, TV serialization, digitality, media mix, sound, authorship and spectatorship, animals, race, gender, cuteness, animism and environment. Animated films made in China, Japan, and other parts of the world will be analyzed as case studies.",
