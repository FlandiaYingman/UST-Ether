        "description": "This course provides an overview of the various forms of popular culture in East Asia and focuses on the question of how the rise of East Asian popular culture reflects the desire for \"modernity\" and \"modernization\" in each East Asian country and affects the interactions among them. Numerous popular cultural forms - music, film, TV drama, manga/anime, novels, entertainment, food, fashion and design - in Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan will be examined. The increasing global fascination of or craze for East Asian popular culture and how such East Asian \"soft power\" has inspired and transformed the global aesthetics and popular imagination or understanding of East Asia will also be discussed.",

            "comment_teaching": "好注重參與，聲稱自己完sem會記得80%人名，參與度唔高的同學grade都唔會好（其實認真溫notes，認真做group project就唔會低分）。把聲唔係幾好聽，所以都冇認真上。不過一定要上堂，因為ppt會好後期先up上canvas（真係就final先up，想溫都冇得溫）同埋有d slides上堂講ppt唔比（通常係片果d）",

            "comment_workload": "唔算大。雖然成日有pop up quiz，但通常都係上wiki睇完簡介就答倒（考content唔考分析，主要想知你有冇睇）。Mid－term彈性好大，好多題essay任揀幾題做。可以淨係溫你熟悉的topics。最大workload應該係group project。重點係要有心，有人拍片有人畫漫畫。同埋唔好free ride。",
