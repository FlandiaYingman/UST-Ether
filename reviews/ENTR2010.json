Students can choose their own area of interest to study, and they can also explore and further develop their interested area with their mentor. While there will be group meetings every two weeks, students are required to explore and participate in entrepreneurship activities on their own. The instructor will help students consolidate their experiences. Instructor's approval is required for course enrollment. Graded P or F.",
