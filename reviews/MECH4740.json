The course will have three important objectives: (1) to teach the basic theories and fundamentals of numerical methods; (2) to help the students to acquire skills to implement these methods for computer solution; and finally (3) to provide an environment where the students can familiarize themselves with many today's popular commercial software systems, such as MATLAB, and their use in the solution of engineering problems.",

            "comment_content": "This course focuses on the classical numerical methods commonly used in engineering applications. This course is one of the MECH electives in engineering design option. I chose this course according to my interest, though I didn't declare the design option. If you are interested in CAD or conducting research in mechanical engineering, this is one of the must-take courses.<br /><br />The course content mainly follows the textbook called &quot;Numerical Methods for Engineers&quot; by S.C. Chapra and R.P. Canale. There are a total of 30 chapters to be covered in this course, so not all contents are covered in depth. However, the breadth of this course is enough as an introduction course to numerical methods. It covers from different kinds of computation errors, root finding, solving systems of equations, optimization before midterm, to curve fitting, numerical integration and differentiation, and solving ODE and PDE numerically. The final exam is non-cumulative.<br /><br />This course mainly focuses on the understanding of the operations and limitations of different numerical methods, thus the motivation on the improvements. There are only little problems in homeworks and exams directly related to computation and the use of calculators. <br /><br />To me, as a math lover, this should be one of my most favorite MECH course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Being an expert in designing algorithms for computer-aided design, Prof. Tang can clearly point out the essence of different numerical methods, which is important in showing the motivation of different kinds of algorithms. He is patient in answering the problems raised by students after class. You can also see his enthusiasm in his teaching. He always repeats on some important points, making sure that everyone can follow him, but this makes the lecture a bit boring. Sometimes it seems that he is not preparing well for some classes. At the end of semester, as he was not available in some lectures, he rushed through the last 2 chapters in 1 single lecture. But those contents were tested a lot in the final exam, so be aware of that.<br /><br />Our TA (Zhaoyu) is also a good guy. He is always willing to help in your project and labs. He also replies emails fast.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework&nbsp;&nbsp;5% (easy score)<br />Lab projects&nbsp;&nbsp;15%<br />Mid-term exam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40%<br />Final exam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40%<br /><br />For the homework, as long as you have done the questions, you have marks, no matter you do them correct or not.<br /><br />For the labs, we need to use MATLAB to implement the algorithms. It first starts with the basics, then go to the implementation part. Most of the labs are easy, except one, which is extremely difficult that no one can do that. The TA is (somehow) forced to release the solution. <br /><br />There is a final project which is also counted in the 15% labs mark. Not very difficult, but you may need to ask your TA to guide you through it. You need to show him the demo and upload your code to Canvas.<br /><br />The midterm exam is divided into 2 1.5-hour sessions during lecture hours. It allows 3 A4 (6 pages) cheatsheets. However I only made 5 pages as there is not much content. For the final exam, it is an open-computer exam, but Wifi not allowed. You can prepare some MATLAB codes first if you have MATLAB installed in your computer. As I have mentioned, both exams focuses on concepts rather than computations. You don't need to afraid of doing a lot of computations and iterations during the exams. Making sure that you know how those algorithms work is adequate.<br /><br />My result:<br />Homework: full (easy as I have submitted all of them)<br />Lab projects: full (also easy)<br />Midterm: 84/100 <br />(other statistics unknown as this mark is not shown on Canvas. We get our papers individually at almost the end of a lecture. There is one question quite controversial, and TA said that we may have some marks raised, so this is not the exact mark)<br />Final: unknown (but I should be doing ok, maybe I can get 90 or above over 100)<br /><br />Grade: A+<br /><br />I don't know what exactly happened as the grading criteria are quite in a black box. However, prof said that this course adopts absolute grading that above 80 secures A range. I think the cut off may have been slightly adjusted.",
            "comment_workload": "Not much. But make sure that you do all the homeworks by yourself, not just directly copying from the solutions. As long as you pay attention in class, as prof always repeats the content, I can almost understand the contents at once (no need to study much after lecture). Most of the workload is on preparing the cheatsheets for the midterm. I used a week to prepare this and this makes me revise thoroughly for the midterm exam. For the final exam, there is a final review pdf file about what exactly the final exam covers. Just scan through the lecture notes and you are fine in the final exam.",
