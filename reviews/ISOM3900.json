Sometimes she left out some blanks in the slide and you needed to jot down the answers in class, but you can still catch up with the lecture recordings. <br />She also gave us a lot of practice problems for us to complete outside class.<br />You can always reach her easily outside class.

Just stick to what you have learnt in class. Done in group basis so better find some responsible groupmates.<br /><br />Term Project: Choose 1 of the 6 topics and apply the course concepts and tools (Excel). The most tedious part is finding sufficient and appropriate data for calculation. Calculation part should not be very challenging. Record a &lt;25-min presentation video (Showing ppt slides with your narration in the video) and upload to Canvas at last. No live presentation is required. <br /><br />Final Exam: Open-book. 8 questions to be completed within 2 hours, which is quite demanding. I'm sure no one can finish the entire exam. I don't think the questions are tricky but do pay attention to what the number represents (especially for calculation in game theory). The practice problems are helpful for you to prepare the exam.

            "comment_content": "The content of this course is learning different tools for decision making. The course is clearly divided into 3 sessions. The first part is Decision Making Under Uncertainty. It is kind of a review of decision tree, LP model and Markov Process, which are relatively easy to understand. The second part is Strategic and Interactive Decision Making, which is mainly about Game Theory. It is still not very hard since Man Yu teaches us to use shortcut to get the solutions. The third part is Statistical Decision Making. This is the most sophisticated part in the course because some statistical knowledge are required. Yet, the good news is you don't really need a 100% understanding to the concept as long as you are familiar with the way to answer questions.<br /><br />Other than the prerequisite of ISOM2500 and ISOM2700, I believe taking ISOM3710 in advance also helps since Data Analysis and Solver functions in excel are used in this course.",

Although she may overrun sometimes, she lets students go and she will stay behind for further questions.

You only need to work with your groupmates and submit 1 answer per group. <br /><br />For the team project, you can either choose to think of a decision problem and apply the tools learnt from the course, or further investigate in the tools learnt or new tools. You may need some extra research to support your ideas.<br /><br />The final exam is open-book and open-note, while it is quite difficult and with inadequate time to complete. We got 120 minutes to answer 9 questions. Most questions are with long background information and sub-questions, and some questions are tricky and really require deep understanding of the concepts.",

            "comment_teaching": "I quite like the professor! He prepared his presentations well. There was no textbooks. Just jot down whatever he said and took the time to understand the lecture materials, and I think you should do pretty well on the exams. Don't be afraid to ask! Both the professor &amp; the TA should be plenty helpful.",

I got very lucky that two of my groupmates are practically experts in Python and R, so that helps a lot, they basically carry the group :&quot;) But if you don't get as lucky as I am, just consult to the TA a lot to make sure that you are heading in the right direction",
