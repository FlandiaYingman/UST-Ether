        "description": "This course examines the economic situations of low and middle-income economies, considering many important topics in the field of development economics. It addresses questions such as what factors help explain why some countries are rich and others poor and whether economic policies can affect these factors. We will study key aspects of life for poor households in the developing world, such as inequality, gender and the intra-household division of resources, education, child labor, health, savings and credit, institutions and globalization. Students will also study recent research in the field and examine empirical evidence on these topics. Prior knowledge in introductory economics and basic statistics is beneficial.",
