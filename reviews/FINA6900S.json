        "description": "Real estate is an important industry in Asia Pacific with long term potential given continued urbanization, increasing wealth and strong economic growth. Financing is an important decision factor determining returns for developers and investors in real estate. For banks, real estate financing is an important business given the relatively large size of the industry. This course focuses on how real estate financing is undertaken and the key considerations for the borrower and the lender. This is achieved through a master case study which runs through the duration of the course and evolves as different aspects of real estate financing are discussed. The course will focus on the key steps in a transaction life-cycle and require participants to prepare basic cashflow models, approval memos and termsheets including presenting them. Some additional case studies around hedging will cover specific considerations around cross border real estate investments which is a big focus for global real estate investors.",
