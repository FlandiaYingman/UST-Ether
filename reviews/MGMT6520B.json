        "description": "This entrepreneurship course will address the central organizational issues involved in founding and leading new business ventures. The topics covered will include accelerating idea generation, assembling cofounders and initial team, attracting investors, managing board of directors, and selling to large customers. A deeper understanding of these issues is likely to increase the odds of success for entrepreneurs, as well those who intend to work with startups as investors or employees. In addition to the traditional classroom discussion, this course will use role plays and live case studies, possibly involve a site visit and a simulation, and will draw upon the latest research on entrepreneurship.",
