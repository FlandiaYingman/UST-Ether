            "comment_workload": "It really comes down to the quality of your group-mates.<br />After every lessons, students have to answer some questions on that day and the professor will mark it.<br />There are missions to be done with social web platforms, some article-reading-plus-question-answering and tiny workload of research periodically but those were extremely easy tasks.<br />The written report only requires something like 5 pages with font-size 12.",
