        "description": "This is an independent course on rough path analysis and its applications to SPDEs based on the book “A Course on Rough Paths; With an Introduction to Regularity Structures” by Peter K. Friz and Martin Hairer. The main focus will be the space of rough paths, Brownian motion as a rough path, integration against rough paths, stochastic integration and Ito’s formula, Doob-Meyer type decomposition for rough paths, operations on controlled rough paths, solutions to rough differential equations, stochastic differential equations, Gaussian rough paths, and so on. Students should seek instructor's approval to take this course.",
