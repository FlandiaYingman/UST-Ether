        "description": "Cloud computing realizes the long-held ambition of big data processing. By pooling a huge number of commodity servers into a large cluster, cloud computing allows big data applications, such as web search and social networks, to scale out to thousands of nodes, accommodating their ever-growing computing demands in spite of the stalling processor speed. Building computer systems at such a large scale poses a number of challenges on system design, implementation, and management. In this course, we will examine advanced research topics in Cloud systems, data processing frameworks, and networking. Example topics include the architecture of Cloud datacenters and networks, state-of-the-art data processing frameworks, Cloud workload characteristics, resource management and scheduling, and the storage systems. The course will be paper reading-based coupled with open-ended course projects.",
