        "description": "This course is designed to expose students with a broad survey of the important issues in the study of comparative politics. It will provide students with a set of commonly used concepts in understanding politics around the world and teach students the statistical skills to compare different political systems with quantitative data. The course is organized around major problems and concepts in comparative politics rather than around particular countries. The topics include comparative methodology, public policy, political economy, political communication, democracy and authoritarianism, ideology and political culture, nationalism and nation-state, revolution and social movement, political participation and representation, and political institutions. These concepts and themes will help students master more advanced topics in future courses.",

Professor will teach some extra knowledge about the topic in textbook. Both all reading content required and some video indicated by prof will be tested in the quizzes.<br />Quizzes are not cumulated by some successive concepts should be remembered in order to score good grade for following quizzes. (For example, which country is democracy tested in quiz2 wouldn't be tested in quiz3 but the concept of democracy should be known after you learned that in class.)<br />Since prof has Chinese background and his own researches about Chinese politics (Mainland China), he taught some specific knowledge about Chinese politics, which is a gift for Mainlanders.<br />Overall, content is good enough for those who liikes politics.",
            "comment_teaching": "The course is recorded and you just need to finish it before the ddl of hw. Prof Tang is very kind and patient to explain every concept clearly with vivid examples. Also, review sessions were provided for the last three quizzes. He replied emails and answered my questions clearly. For the recorded classes, since Prof Tang spoke slowly(which is very funny, at least I think so), you can understand the content with 1.5x.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading of the quizzes is based on a curve. The highest score for each quiz will be treated as 15%. A make up <br />quiz is only allowed if the student presents a doctor’s note stating the student’s inability to take the quiz during the scheduled time. A make-up quiz will not be graded on a curve. No late written assignment/discussion will be accepted unless there is a doctor’s note stating the student’s inability to complete the assignment by the due date. Discussions and assignments will not be curved.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Assignments 30%<br />Online Discussions 10%<br />Quizzes (15% eachx 4) 60%<br />Final grades will be awarded based on the following ranges:<br />A+ &gt; 97 B+ 89-86 C+79-76 D+69-66 F&lt; 59<br />A 96-94 B 85-83 C 75-73 D 65-63<br />A- 93-90 B- 82-80 C- 72-70 D-62-60<br />Mean for assignments and discussions are very high, so the grade is basically about quizzes. However, the curve for the quizzes is completely unclear and you will never know what point you exactly get.<br />My score for reference:<br />Assignment: 44.5/45 Discusssion: 63.5/65<br />Quiz 1: 37/42 mean:35.36 high:41 (lots of cheaters since there's no proctor and next 3 quizzes had proctors with camera requirements)<br />Quiz 2: 44/50 mean:38.39 high: 47<br />Quiz 3: 41/48 mean: 31.64 high:43 <br />Quiz 4: 47/49 mean: 37.42 high: 49<br />Prof gave everyone who helped him finish the survey for his research one point to their total grade.<br />My total urve grade: unknown <br />Final letter grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "workload could be light if you have had some knowledge about politics and modern world history. If you know complete nothing, you can still finish hw and quizzes but you will spend much more time. Since textbook and videos all in English, your reading and listening abilities are very important. Test needs to remember everything about readings without cheat sheets, so that should be heavy workload before quizzes (though I think some students find their way cheating).",

            "comment_workload": "Ard 10 discussions and 10 assignemnts.<br />Assignments carry a higher weighting and questions are of different styles. Discussion is just some short essays, however, sometimes you need to write in 100-200 words, you have to consider carefully what should be included in the essay. All work should use the concepts taught in lessons or course materials or you will lose some marks. Overall, the workload is acceptable but annoying as there are a lot of steps in some of the assignments like you have to make an excel sheet of a lot of data, if you cannot calculate the right answer, some marks will be lost.",
