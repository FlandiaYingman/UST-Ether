It aims to provide undergraduate students with foundational and thematic knowledge ofEuropean history, as well as an understanding of the ways that European politics, culture, and economy have been shaped through encounters with non-European societies—through cultural and commercial exchange, imperialism and decolonization, Cold War rivalries, and globalization. The course readings explore the ways that political, social, technological, and economic developments affected Europeans’ ability to project power, both within the borders of the modern state and beyond it, and considers the sources and limitations of that power. The course is aimed at students from all backgrounds; no prior acquaintance with history is presupposed.",
            "comment_teaching": "Derman is a really, really good professor. He explains his ideas well, and he always give thorough answers to all of his students. He speaks slowly because he wants to make sure that people understand what he's saying. DO NOT HESITATE to go to him or the TA if you're confused about something. They're always happy to help.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is okay. As long as you try your best in the presentation and take notes during his lectures, you'll be fine. Everything that will appear on the exams are all mentioned in his lectures, so really listen well and ask questions if you're confused about something. There are required readings but I didn't go through them because Derman had already explained everything very clearly.",

As the course name implies, HUMA 2590 offers introductory and fundamental knowledge of European history from the 15th century (with some background information tracing back to earlier centuries) to the end of the Cold War. Throughout the course, several main historical events would be introduced. Students would understand why European societies were regarded as political, cultural and economic powerhouses and how they shaped the development of the modern era; how Europe stood as the center of modernization, ideologies, revolutions, and conflicts; as well as understanding how Europe affected civilizations outside herself through imperialism and globalization. Two macrohistorical questions pertaining to Europe's extensive influence over the globe and the decline of European empires would help students reflect modern and contemporary history in a comparative and theoretical manner. If you have acquired some basic common sense of history, you could easily catch up with the course content. But generally, this course is not too difficult.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Derman is knowledgeable in modern European history, and his research focuses on Germany. While he mainly recited the information on the PowerPoints, he provided some extra details. In the first few weeks of the course, he discussed the readings with us, but he eventually dropped the practice (he probably knew that many of us did not read the readings in advance, and there was not enough time to finish all the lectures if he continued to do that) and just typed some of the arguments in the readings in the lecture notes instead. It is nice of him to officially extend the final paper deadline for two weeks until the final exam. Remember to ask him in case you have encountered anything difficult, and he will endeavor to respond.",
            "comment_grading": "Participation (10%): the instructor randomly selected 8 lessons to let us sign our name on the attendance sheet, which counts for 8%. The other 2% is for the mandatory meeting with the instructor to discuss the midterm paper.<br /><br />Midterm and final exams (20% for each): 40 multiple-choice questions and 10 map questions (not sure if changes would occur). Questions would include everything that is typed on the PowerPoints and the required readings. Jotting extra notes is unnecessary, but you should thoroughly revise (or recite) the information on the lecture notes. Beware of some questions that would ask you to recall the correct order of events (like the process of the French Revolution and the Holocaust). Main arguments raised in the required readings would also be examined. As for the map questions, the instructor would give you the maps in advance and s/he would offer a list of city and country names that would be tested. I personally find it easy. <br /><br />Midterm and final papers (25% for each): You have to write two 7-page essays based on the required readings. The topic is related to the aforementioned two macrohistorical questions. Just approach the professor if you have any problems regarding the readings or the essays. <br /><br />My marks:<br />Participation: full marks<br />Midterm exam: 82/100 (mean: 60 or 60-something if I remember right)<br />Midterm paper: 94/100 (mean: 80-something)<br />Final exam: 88/100<br />Final paper: 92/100<br /><br />Final grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "I would say the workload is average as you do need to spend time comprehending the required readings in order to write your essays and prepare for the exams. There is a textbook for this course, but unless you are a beginner in European history or you want to supplement yourself with more historical details, reading the textbook is somewhat unnecessary as studying the required readings and the lecture notes are probably more than enough for dealing with the assessments. Other than that, just remind yourself to attend the lessons.",

            "comment_grading": "The grading is a little frustrating. You must hand in 2 essays and complete 2 exams. No homework. He will give broad prompts for the essays and you are expected to write a thoughtful 8 page answer to the question but you are not expected to come up with your own new theories. This essay is largely to prove that you have read the assigned readings, book, and PowerPoint slides. He will grade your essay quite fairly and does not penalise grammatical errors. <br /><br />The exam, on the other hand, is a grading nightmare. The exam has 3 sections: a map question, a multiple choice section, and a long essay section. For the map question, you will receive a map without country or city names. Identify the countries or cities- easy. The multiple choice questions directly test things from the PowerPoint slides or lectures. So just pick the correct answer - easy. For the long essay, you must pick 4 out of 6 topics (e.g, The Enlightenment or Isaac Newton) and describe it fully. You never know what he is looking for, so you must regurgitate everything you know.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is very high. You will be assigned readings every week. The readings are 1-2&nbsp;&nbsp;chapters from Modern Civilisations and an extra essay/paper/book chapter that discusses a theme in more detail. This is around 100-200 pages of reading per week. You cannot skip this section because you need the readings to complete the essays and the exams.",

            "comment_grading": "成個COURSE有MID TERM, FINAL, 兩次QUIZ，形式大致一樣，都係有MC、地圖題、名詞解釋題，SQ，而FINAL會有LQ。名詞解釋題係最難既一PART，佢會隨機抽一堆歷史詞彙出黎要你解釋，如果你唔熟歷史既話，會完全中唔到PT。而SQ同LQ都係鬥背書，主要考下你有冇記熟佢上堂講既野。但其實我上堂都冇咩聽過佢講書，因為英文唔係太追到，主要係靠自習COURSE既READINGS，最尾靠睇熟D READINGS都輕鬆拎A。身邊FD多數爛GRADE，但個人認為本COURSE係純粹努力就OK，唔需要太多咩技巧。",
