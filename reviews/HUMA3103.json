Students will also learn team-building skills and develop attentiveness to partners in an ensemble. This is a course for students who are highly motivated, and sufficiently trained and experienced in classical music performance. Enrollment in the course requires instructor's approval based on audition outcome.",

They gave comments on the techniques, communication within the ensemble, and interpretation of the chosen work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In this semester, one piano trio and one piano quartet were formed. The instructors chose (Debussy - Piano Trio in G major) and (Brahms - Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor) for these groups, respectively.<br /><br />‚ùó Audition is required in the first week of the semester before joining this course. It requires two contrasting pieces within 15 minutes. I played (Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor - 3rd movement) &amp; (Bach Partita in D Minor BWV 1004 - Allemande) for audition.",
            "comment_teaching": "‚úÖ Both instructors (Dr. Amy Sze &amp; Mr. Anders Hui) were passionate and gave useful feedback to improve our musicianship. <br /><br />‚úÖ Remarkable that Mr. Anders Hui is the second associate concertmaster of HKPhil, he offered some practical comments on violin techniques to me. <br /><br />‚úÖ Dr. Amy SZE is a pianist, who helped those 'solo' pianist to adapt the changes from playing solo music to chamber music repertoire.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is absolute and normally all students get a satisfactory grade because they have strong musical background. <br /><br />üíØCourse Grading:<br />1Ô∏è‚É£ Final Public Performance - 40%<br />2Ô∏è‚É£ Mid-Term Performance - 30%<br />3Ô∏è‚É£ Participation - 20%<br />4Ô∏è‚É£ Attendance - 10%<br /><br />Final grade: A- (This grading did not apply to my other teammate. He got one subgrade lower)<br /><br />The other piano quartet group with more experience in making chamber music got A.",
            "comment_workload": "We heavily relied on out-of-class practice. Our chamber music group rehearsed before classes on few aspects: the basic intonation, rhythm, and make the piece in-form. If the group refuse to rehearsal, you will waste time in lessons. <br /><br />Substantial amount of practices must be done in order to give a professional performance.",
