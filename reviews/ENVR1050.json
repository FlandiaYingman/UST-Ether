Since project groups are formed early and group members have to sit together in the course, most works(not just the project) in this course can be coordinated and shared within the group, so good luck avoiding freeriders :)<br /><br />Attendance and PRS: Usually occur mid-class. You need to watch the reading materials(can require up to 2 hours) before the lessons and then answer PRS questions related to them. After project groups are formed, some groups will coordinate one member to read the materials and carry the PRS, so it depends on whether your teammates want to take up this task lol.<br /><br />Project: Heavy workload if you want A range because of its large weighting in the grade. A somewhat in-depth investigation on a sustainability topic followed by a ppt presentation and poster presentation. PPT presentation is mainly to describe the problem and propose some directions for the in-class discussion that follows, so the workload for this is not big. Poster have to be very detailed and also good-looking (Infographics design with Adobe AI recommended, many groups use it), so reserve a lot of time to do it.<br /><br />Midterm/Final: Consists of two parts. Part A are short questions that usually listed in the first few slides of lecture notes and also the keyword list. You can (and you should) prepare them in advance, need half to full week to do so. Part B=DSE English writing. If you are good at high school English writing this part is easy.

            "comment_content": "Content is somewhat interesting if you like learning a bit about the environment and what is causing global warming. A lot of the content you have probably seen in high school or just throughout your everyday life.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is engaging and since it is a small classroom most of the students are paying attention and don't chat or sleep. He cracks some jokes form time to time.",
            "comment_grading": "PRS quizzes are somewhat easy, there are about 10-11 PRS quizzes during the course of the semester but only your best 8 count.<br />Most people get between 4/5 and 5/5 for the presentation.<br />The essay/definition grading is very lenient, if you understand the terms and know how to explain it clearly in your own words you will get the points.<br /><br />Grade Obtained: A+",
            "comment_workload": "The work load for this course is very acceptable. There are PRS quizzes almost every lecture that are based off of TED Talks or videos given as homework to watch. They are open book and fairly laid-back so you can discuss the answers with your classmates if done so quietly. People also used the transcription of some videos and ted talks in order to try and answer the questions. <br />There are 2 group projects:<br />- first is a 5 minute presentation on your topic, worth I think around 5 point (beginning of the semester)<br />- second is a poster on the same topic, where classmates and professors ask you about your topic, testing your knowledge on your topic. This is worth about 20 points&nbsp;&nbsp;(end of the semester)<br />There is a midterm and final, where you are asking 2 essay questions based on the lecture notes as well as 5 definitions. <br />The workload might seem like a lot but it is relatively easy and spread out during the course of the semester.",
