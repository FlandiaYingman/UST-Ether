        "description": "Contemporary Theatre has developed to take on many forms beyond naturalistic drama, including Dance Theatre, Multimedia Theatre, Physical Theatre, Site-Specific Theatre and more new forms are constantly emerging. These exciting forms of theatre are often created with the method called Devised Theatre which is a highly collaborative and experimental way of making theatre pieces. It is widely adopted by many contemporary theatre groups of different scales and styles all over the world. In Devised Theatre, all participants work together to create a performance, on a theme of their choice, by making use of various starting materials including photos, objects, songs, news articles, maps, letters, poems, creative writings, movements and even architectural space. In this course, students will become creative performers who will create, edit, design and perform a short piece of original theatre work.",

Usually some body movements and group activities, which are relaxing.<br />After that, we have time to do the group practices for some exercise given in each class. Normally some short performance using different devising or performing skills. The class size is small, and the group division for in-class exercise(not the final performance) is different every time so you could meet and cooperate with new people.",

Very easy and it's ok even if you don't do it .<br /><br />The only countable workload comes from the final performance, students need to form groups weeks before and self-direct and perform a play that lasts for 10-15 minutes. The instructor would give you time in class for practice. But if you want to do it well, you also need to arrange some time for after-class practice.<br /><br />However, due to the social unrest this semester, the final performance was replaced by an alternative essay, adding some workload to the final weeks.",
