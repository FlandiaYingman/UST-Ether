        "description": "The course examines the growing integration of science and technology in our workplaces, the impact of science and technology on the direction of work, the workplace and even capitalism itself. The course investigates how science and technology have been key factors in shaping work since at least the beginning of factory production and generally explores the interactions between science, technology and work since that period. By surveying a range of topics and readings from history, sociology and anthropology of the workplace, this course also includes comparative discussions of science and technology as it is integrated into the workplace in industry as compared to the services.",

            "comment_grading": "The grading is harsh!<br />The mean is so high! You need to study everything and memorize them whole-heartedly to get a good grade without any careless mistakes. Everyone get similar marks in the iPRS questions. The group discussion marks also contributed a lot in the grading so mare sure you have great groupmates. <br />My midterm and final step mean but get low marks in group discussion part and I get a C.<br />-<br />Grading scheme for the final grade (pulling curve)<br />A range: 87-100 <br />B range: 80-86.99<br />C range: 60-79.99",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not much for a sosc course. As it should bean introductory course, the prof expects that there are students from all the schools. <br />For midterm exam, there are MC and short questions. Only 2 MC are related to the readings. <br />For final exam, part A is MC and part B is short and long questions. He gives you chance to choose between them .Totally you need to answer 10 points in part B, each short questions contribute 2.5 points and each long questions contribute 5 points. So you can choose to answer 4S, 2L, 2S+1L. <br />However, I didnt expect the mean is so high for all the grading parts. <br />iPRS questions are taken every lesson. The lesson is held on mon wed 12:00 so it should be easy to catch up the classes. But if you escape lesson, you can still ask your friends to give you the code. Make sure you answer them. 10 points for correct answers, 4 points for incorrect answers but no points if u miss them!<br />Group discussion nearly once a week. It is based on a passage and asking questions relating to the lecture notes. Sometimes quite hard.<br />Readings are boring for me so I didnt even finish one.",

These aren't too difficult as long as you're familiar with the lecture slides and the reading summaries.<br />The PRS questions were based on lecture materials and readings so it helps to attend and pay attention in all classes. Discussion is allowed during these exercises so you do usually end up with the correct answer.<br />For the group discussions you have to write a one to two page group report in class based on a reading and a question that the professors provides in the same class. While it isn't too difficult to get a satisfactory grade, getting a high score requires a proper analysis of the materials so it helps to have input from all the group members as well as an understanding of the lecture materials.",

This requires input from each group member, in order to come up with a good report in time, therefore choose your group members wisely.<br />20 PRS exercises are held in class, related to lectures, videos shown in class and readings, they can be tough but he chooses 17 PRS exercises and grades your best 15, that helps a bit.",

He also gives us readings related to the topics, but they are very lengthy, I did not read them. Though they are very helpful, for someone who likes reading should definitely go over them. He does include a few questions related to the readings in the mid term and finals. Although close to the end of semester he gave us summaries of all the readings, those were helpful, specially for PRS exercises which are often based on readings. Oh one more thing, he doesn't take attendance, but he usually takes a PRS every class, therefore if you are absent you get zero in that PRS, secondly you also get zero if you miss a Group discussion exercise. So if you want a good grade do attend all the classes, his lectures are definitely worth the time.",
