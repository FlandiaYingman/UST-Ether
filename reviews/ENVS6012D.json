        "description": "Earth Is an Ocean World with 71% of its surface covered by ocean. The oceanography is the story and the processes of unifying principles in the ocean. It integrates the disciplines of geology (Geological Oceanography) that  focuses on earth structure related to earthquake prediction and distribution of valuable resources, physics (Physical Oceanography) that studies ocean currents, waves, and air-sea interaction, long-term climate change, biology (Biological Oceanography)  that works with the nature and distribution of marine organisms, marine species and fisheries, chemistry (Chemical Oceanography) that investigates oceanâ€™s dissolved solids and gases and their relationship to geology and biology of the ocean and engineering (Ocean Engineering) that designs and builds oil platforms, ships and harbors. These topics are directly associated with marine resources and pollution of our great concerns. This course covers the inter-disciplinary topics in oceanography that introduces process of science and astonishing story of global ocean as well as the ocean around us in the Southeast Asia.",
