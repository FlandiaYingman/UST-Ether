This course aims to equip students who are interested in entrepreneurship with knowledge on technology and business application of Blockchain, especially smart contract design in Ethereum, and provide an entrepreneurism journey. Students will work in teams of 5 with diverse background to develop and present a social impact program using Blockchain technology for government and non-profit organizations. Students will also need to be involved hands-on and engaged with real-world problems and business ecosystems. Prior experience in programming or entrepreneurship classes is not necessary but a plus. Student enrollment in this course requires the approval of the course instructor.",
