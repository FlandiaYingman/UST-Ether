Values explored in this course will be drawn from those closely related to the mission and vision of UST like humanistic concerns of others and the environment, respect of differences and justice, communicative sensitivity, complexity of humanity, potential bias and fallacy in popular perceptions, values, and stereotyping, among others. The humanities disciplinary approaches will be drawn from history, philosophy, literature, anthropology, linguistics and art. The course is offered in separate sections, each has its specific values and approach identified by the teacher.",

Though there may be PRS questions, I skipped all the lessons after midterm. Can't withstand at all.<br /><br />Tutorial: B<br />Nigel is a nice tutor, but he sticks to the plan closely. Nothing should be diverted in his session. He is easy going though. In this course, tutors are controlling 50% of your course marks, so they are more important. Follow what he/she wants will be good.

You will gain extra 3% bonus marks for your attendance in this course and professor checks it randomly. <br />also, the most important thing is your essay. Better prepare bit by bit after your writing workshop. You will find it easier to start and write your long essay, which consists of 1000 words. <br />there are only 5 writing worshops thoughout 13 weeks and you must attend all of them as all of them would count a percentage of attendance. Try to ask questions about your essay as your instructor will grade your essay.<br />you have to finish all the online exercises as well. you have infinitive chance to answer those questions. so don't worry about this part. you will easily gain about 10% of final course grade.",

If you've taken the IB you will have no problem writing them, as they're completely BS anyways but still count for like 10% of your grade.<br /><br />The quizzes on the other hand are bit more important and count for 20% in total. They're mainly focused on content, which is in the lecture PPTs and some readings which you can do the day before your quiz.<br /><br />The final essay is the most important aspect and accounts for 50% of your grade. You do have to ace that but honestly its not hard. If you speak English somewhat decently there is no way you can fail this.

It's better to cite some sources but really they just want you to express your own ideas. <br /><br />For essay drafts, it's a step by step approach.

At fifty, I knew the Tianming (天命). At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.” This is a self-reflection of Confucius. The improvement throughout his life, not only demonstrates the life of a man of virtue (junzi 君子), but also highlights the dialectical characteristic of Chinese philosophy. This characteristic can be shown by the correlation between righteousness, destiny and well-being.<br /><br />Lectures and readings will be (mainly) built upon selected texts of Chinese classics. Through studying the texts, students will reflect and explore the deep meanings and relationship between the concepts of righteousness, destiny and well-being, which demonstrate the dialectical characteristic of philosophy of life in both Classical Confucianism and Classical Daoism. For the concept of righteousness, moral conflict between Confucianism and Mohism will be explored, together with the idea of dissolving the distinction between right and wrong in Daoism. For the concept of destiny, the discussion will begin with the ideas of endeavor (li 力) and destiny (ming 命) in the Liezi, followed by possible replies from Mencius, Xunzi and Zhuangzi. As for the concept of well-being, the ultimate goals of the philosophy of life in Confucianism and Daoism will be discussed, and the possibility of obtaining well-being under the influence of destiny will be shown.",

But you have to attend two lectures which involve in-class MC quiz as each quiz takes up 10% of the total grade. It's not difficult if you spend one night before the quiz to study. I didn't spend much time to study the quizzes so my scores are a bit below mean but those MC questions are not that difficult. Ans, you have to attend all the five tutorial lessons and finish all the online tasks which are all MCs on time. Online discussions are also required and you have to write as much as possible if you really want to get good marks for this part. (basically more than 500 words for each topic, total 3 topics). At last, the term essay accounts for 50% of the total grade so it's the most important.",

I took HUMA 1000(C) so it was more on the lines of economic growth and development in Hong Kong from a historic and humanitarian standpoint. The content is all scattered and very descriptive depending on the course title and its contents. Would the content help you learn something practical and constructive? Very unlikely, however it may be interesting for someone simply trying to attain a historical background into Hong Kong and China and how business activities and credit creation were structured.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching in lectures was relatively boring. The lecturer would often speak in Cantonese and even the course content was delivered in an uninteresting manner. The lectures do not have any attendance so most people will prefer to skip them.<br />While, the writing workshops with mandatory attendance are much more interactive with focus on working on a final essay based on the provided essay prompts. Further, there are segments such as introduction, first paragraph, counter argument, conclusion, etc. which are taught how to structure and write as per university guidelines.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading for this particular course heavily depends on how you perform in the quizzes, mandatory attendance, performance in writing workshop weekly assignments and your final essay. These parameters have different weights but would recommend paying special attention to everything taught in writing workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I received B+ while I had missed a writing workshop and performed poorly in my second quiz. I would advise you to take the activities during writing workshops seriously.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is relatively low. There were 2 MCQ quizzes (10 marks each) based on lecture slides. Writing workshops have weekly exercises towards making you work on your final essay. There is a final essay which also needs to be submitted, however there is no final. For the quizzes, a simple skimming of the lecture slides is generally enough to perform well. I would also recommend you to go through required docs for reading as several questions are asked from there. Lastly, write your final essay on a prompt for which you are comfortable.",

But no worries, as long as you follow the path of the tutorial sessions which you will be required to write one part of the essay.

As for the close book quiz, just remember to have a look at the ppt beforehand, then you can nail most of it easily.",

            "comment_workload": "The only good thing is that there were no midterm and no final.<br /><br />For the essay, it does cost some time and effort due to its length (1000 words).<br /><br />For the online forum, I only wrote one post, and submitted that as my chosen post. Secured an A. <br /><br />For the tutorial, as long as you attend all 5 sessions (2 hours each though) and respond to your tutor, you'll get a nice score.<br /><br />For the lectures, I don't always attend them physically but I still got an A. The only time I studied the lecture notes were to look for sth I can quote in my essay. <br /><br />Readings? Didn't touch them at all. You can find enough references online for your essay.<br /><br />Just find your own way to complete all the PRS in-class questions. As for the 2 &quot;quizzes&quot;, revision is barely helpful as the questions were just made to make you not get it correct. So, don't be too serious about them!",

You should at least briefly read through the reading materials one time. There will be two tricky questions requires you to answer Dr. Nam's thought.

Make sure you are present on those days.<br />For the tutorials, you MUST be present every time. It counts towards the tutorial performance (20% of the whole course). Remember to answer as many questions as you can, especially at the beginning of the course. As your tutor is rumored to be the one who marks your final essay, fighting for a better impression could bring you a little advantage. <br />The MOST IMPORTANT point: Before handing in the final essay, you are required to do your first draft and submit it to the tutor. DO IT SERIOUSLY so that you can ask for very valuable advice from your tutor. After you receive the feedback, you MUST correct your draft ACCORDING to the tutor's advice.

Are there absolute moral rules?<br /><br />The topics explained through powerpoint presentations by the professors and individual assigned reading will then be used to write a term essay with the following titles:<br /><br />1.\tAnalyze the possible meanings of the “good life.” State your own conception of the good life and why you think it is good. <br /><br />2.\tWould you agree that all human actions are ultimately motivated by self-interest? Provide reasons for your agreement/disagreement.<br /><br />3.\tOn page 18 of The Elements of Moral Philosophy (Ch.2), James and Stuart Rachels provide the following argument against Cultural Relativism: “In some societies, people believe the earth is flat. In other societies, such as our own, people believe that the earth is spherical. Does it follow, from the mere fact that people disagree, that there is no ‘objective truth’ in geography? …Similarly, there is no reason to think that if there is moral truth everyone must know it. The Cultural Differences Argument tries to derive a substantive conclusion about a subject from the mere fact that people disagree. But this is impossible.” How conclusive is this argument against Cultural Relativism? In what sense may Cultural Relativism be valid?",

Go through the PPTs before the quizzes, and you will at least be at the mean.<br />I don't think they really grade anything for the writing workshop in-class activities. You just have to show up.<br />The writing workshop online activities can be completed without having to refer to anything, because you can check the answers after submitting and then re-submit. They take your highest scores, so getting full marks there shouldn't be difficult, unless you forget to complete them before the deadline. You will also have to post your paragraphs, so just write something before the deadline and submit it on time.<br />Final term essay is not too bad, since you will be writing one paragraph each week for the writing workshops.",

It is worth remembering that no answer within the constraints of the essay for this class (1000 words) is going to be exhaustive in responding to the prompt. Rather, you should only attempt to address one aspect of the question that you chose to focus on, using concrete examples and texts given in class as supporting evidence. <br /><br />1)\tHumans are fundamentally social animals. The groups they belong to shape people’s views about the world: family, local community, region, nation. There are also other types of identities that one may feel very strongly about, such as class, religion, ethnicity, etc. Most people have more than one kind of identity, and each identity may be related to a different set of interests. What are some of the potential factors that can influence a person’s adoption of an identity? When multiple identities overlap, what determines which of these take precedence over others? Feel free to use relevant personal experiences, contemporary events, and news items to make your case in addition to the course’s readings.<br /><br />2)\t“War is the mere continuation of politics by other means” is a famous line from Carl von Clausewitz’s On War. In this sense war is the use of violence in disagreements that cannot be resolved peacefully. Yet, when is it permissible to use violence in a breakdown of negotiation? How do societies justify these &quot;exceptional&quot; cases? <br /><br />3)\tWe live in the era of nation-states, where individual states are assumed to represent the interests of a single nation. However national groups other than the national majority live within each nation-state in the contemporary world. Should the interests of these minorities be protected or should they submit to the will of the majority? How should disagreements between the majority group and a minority group be resolved?",

            "comment_teaching": "Honestly, the teaching methods were not as ideal, and the sad thing is that it would be rather hard for this course to improve on its teaching techniques. First of all, the lecture was rather repetitive as we as students were told to read up on the reference materials, then it turns out the professor was going to teach the same thing on the day of the lecture itself. The professor seems like an enthusiastic person as he is always fine with answering the students' questions. As for the tutors in HUMA 1000 tutorials, they seem inconsistent to a certain extent as the content of HUMA 1000 is rather broad and they themselves are not familiar with the final essay requirements.",
            "comment_grading": "In terms of grading, the grading structure seems rather vague, but based on experience(got an A- lol), I would say if you want a good score, you need to work on these areas:<br />1. Language abilities: the emphasis on grading is very heavy in the final essay; if your English is bad, your grades will be bad.<br />2. Knowledge of philosophy: if you do not know anything about philosophy and if you do not seem to understand anything when you go for your lectures, you need to spend some time reading the reference materials they provide.<br />3. Be an active participant on the discussion forums: just keep arguing how you're right and how others are wrong in the comments section.",
            "comment_workload": "For most, the workload is only intense the night before the essay submission; I'd advise you to consistently allocate time for the final essay every now and then. If you're not sure on whether you are going towards the right direction, always try to ask your tutor, because although he might not be clear on the direction of grading, at least he knows more than you, which is more than enough. So just keep learning more along the way, attend the tutorials and the essay will be easy for you to write.",

(as expected of a HUMA 1000 course though so there's no blaming him) <br /><br />My TA was Dr. Danyal and he was amazing. Relatively funny guy with a decent sense of humor. Although his writing workshops are a bit vague, he does a really, really good job at scrutinizing your essay and making sure that you do your best. He's the only reason why the teaching is a C and not an E.",

Just make sure you watch all the lecture videos or attend the lectures before! Although, some questions are really vague so you gotta use some common sense. Remember to read reading material too!<br />I think the mean was around 12.7/20, SD around 3.<br /><br />Online Discussion: Do NOT copy paste other people's work from other sessions because they actually monitor this. You might end up with an F. Make sure you post more than once (I think this helped me) and respond on time to your peers.<br /><br />Online Activities: Make sure you complete all the online quizzes that have unlimited tries. Don't even need to watch the videos that come along with it.<br /><br />Classroom Activities: Basically be on time and come to class for attendance taking. Every tutorial class has a 2% weighting.<br /><br />Final Essay: To be honest, I feel that I have an advantage over this part since English is native to me. So if you have a good command of English, this part shouldn't be a problem for you. Although, HUMA1000 has a really specific essay format along with specific paragraph styles that need to be adhered to. You just have to learn how to make and find convincing arguments.<br /><br />Overall, I got an A+. Marks were not disclosed.",

Just self-study and do the questions in the textbook before the final as it's very similar to the actual questions in the final.",

Just log into Zoom and do whatever you want, that's what I did.<br />Homework: 50%<br />Best 10 out of 12 counted, everyone should get full marks since answers can easily be found online<br />Final Exam: 40%<br />Pretty straightforward exam, she said questions will be similar to those in the textbook and she was right. Nothing too challenging and practicing with the questions in the textbook should help secure a decent grade.<br /><br />Although I got A eventually, I would say the grading is pretty trash because it solely depends on your final and there is no transparency with the grading.",

While examining how the concepts of self, family values, and social responsibilities are framed differently across the course of history in the West and China, this course also devotes attention to the interaction and appropriation of these concepts from the Western context into the Chinese context from comparative perspectives.
