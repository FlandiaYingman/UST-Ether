        "description": "EXPLORE (Explore and Research the Atmospheric Environment) is an integrated experimental platform developed by the HKUST air research team. EXPLORE consists of a hardware platform that allows participants to measure the air pollutants directly using high-school supportable facilities. The course Community EXPLORE: Science to Action, aims to (1) let interested undergraduates learn the technicality of the EXPLORE platform; (2) serve as an advisor to a secondary school on the EXPLORE platform; and (3) lead high school students to conduct some school based educational/research program related to improving their air quality. This is the first part of a two-semester sequel project course. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
