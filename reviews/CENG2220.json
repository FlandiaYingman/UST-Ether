            "comment_teaching": "He is a really nice professer and he is willing to stop his teaching for any questions or confusion. He adopts a white-board teaching method in the beginning but since he is quite spontaneous and does not follow the lecture notes when he is explaining, he switched to powerpoint teaching, which I think is better than white-board. But I am not sure if he will do the same for next spring semester. <br />He assumes all students have strong mathematical skills so be prepared because he commonly skips explanations for certain steps and the pace is a bit fast. He did not highlight the most important things in his notes (his notes are slightly disorganised) so I suggest you to pay 100% attention in class and ask him to provide more help if the lecture material and additional notes are insufficient to understand everything.",

            "comment_teaching": "I can see that the professor is really trying to teach us every bit about the course. And he really tries to answer your questions and he really listens to our feedback. But no offense to the professor, the teaching is not good. He gave a lot of derivations in class (purely flexing his maths), the writing is hard to read and the materials are not organized. He mainly wrote his examples on whiteboard or annotations on iPad, and they are not matching with our lecture notes (i can't read his lecture notes so I just wrote my own notes for revision). I also think he should give more examples related to either chemical reactions or biological systems. We're always dealing with cylindrical pipes/ flat plates and I have no idea how and when we will use them in real life. Also, he repeats himself so many times in the shell balance lectures, which is really unnecessary (maybe he thinks we're dumb). In one of the lectures he just explained why force is negative and I think that's really redundant. If you want to understand clearly on the lecture materials, just go to youtube fluid mechanics tutorials for help. I think the professor is quite nice though so you can always ask him for help. I think the TAs are quite helpful and they're really quick in replying emails and marking assignments/exams.",

I knew the midterm high and the final high weren't the same person so I expect those two to get A+. I ended up with an A+ that's really a surprise. Not sure how the professor distributed the grades (Maybe &gt;2 A+s in a 71 ppl class?). That's classic CENG grading - you work hard and you'll get satisfactory grades.",
            "comment_workload": "There are 8 homework (yes, 8, even more than thermodynamics). Some questions appear to be really weird since he never mentioned it (first homework has torque, and I search it up from some fluid mechanics tutorial on youtube). Half of them are easy ones (&lt;1 hour to complete), the others should take some time but still no more than 3 hours. Other than that we only have two exams.<br />Midterm has one question about surface tension which I found quite ridiculous cuz he didn't even spend 5 mins during his lecture - it is 16 marks btw, out of 100. You should really revise for every piece of material he gave cuz you never know when they would appear. The exams are of classic CENG difficulty with super low mean so no worries.<br />For the tutorial/recitations, the TAs are there to explain homework and exams and anything that you might have questions on. As long as you understand the hw and exam questions, you don't have to go (I didn't attend any except the first two).<br />There are extra tutorials offered by UG TAs which are not too relevant to the course materials (some of the examples are aerodynamics) but it's a good source for you to learn more if you want.

Fluid in Motion (Langrangian and Eulerian)<br />3. Dimensional Analysis, Frictional Factor, Engineering Bernoulli Equation<br />4. Fluid Statics: Manometry, Buoyancy<br />5. Pressure forces<br />6.

Application of Navier-Stokes Equation<br />10. Stream Function, Vortocity and Potential Flow<br />11. Ordering Analysis and Boundary Layer Characteristics<br />12. Mass Transport<br /><br />Although Mass Transport was covered at the end of the semester, it did not appear in the final exam. <br /><br />Overall, this course is basically a Math class, with ALOT of Calculus, and vectors (including del operator, Taylor series, second derivatives, double integrations and etc).<br /><br />Personally, it took me very long time to understand the lecture contents as I am not very good at Calculus and physics. Having said that, if you are good at math or physics and spend a lot of time&nbsp;&nbsp;for this course, you will be fine I guess.<br /><br />Also, it is not required to understand how to derive equations before the Mid-term. In the exam, you just need to know how to apply the equations into different situations. But, for finals, you are required to know how to derive them. The final exam requires you to derive the equation by yourselves starting from the fundamental equations. Personally, second-half of the materials are easier to understand if you watch lectures carefully.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor I-Ming is a passionate professor, who replies my email immediately. Before the Mid-terms, I really really found it hard to understand this teaching as lecture contents are very very hard. He expects you to be familiarized with vector operations in 3D dimensions. There are not many YouTube videos that explain the similar concepts. So I ended up re-watching lecture videos multiple times. However, for the second-half of the material, he teach better and it was much better to understand. The equations get much harder but a lot of terms get cancelled, so it slightly made my life better.",

I guess many classmates also did not understand the lecture material.<br /><br />HWs are marked by 50% on accuracy, and 50% on effort. This means that even if you did wrong, you can still get a lot of points if you used the correct equations and made the right approach. But having the right approach was also hard lol.<br />Good luck. You will definitely have tough times.",
            "comment_workload": "There are 7 HWs<br />Basically one HW per week. Around 4 Questions per HW. No similar questions could be found online, and I personally found them very very hard. It requires you to understand lecture materials thoroughly, and apply them in the questions. When you first read the questions, you will be surprised by how difficult they are. Most are very very lengthy and you may not even understand what the questions are finding. It took me at least 4 hours to complete each HW. It was really a bad experience, and I am very glad that I completed them now. I took this course alongside with CENG 2210 (which is also considered hard course), but CENG 2220 made Thermodynamics course (CENG 2210) relatively easy.",

Then again, fluids is a very broad course in any university, and in other countries it can be a 2 semester class. If you want to truly understand this course, it is encouraged to read on your own.<br /><br />It's also very hard to retain any information from this class because only some of it carries on to Ping Gao's heat and mass transfer. This might be my own bias though because I don't have the best memory (or GPA for that matter).",
