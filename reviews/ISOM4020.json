        "description": "The course focuses on innovation strategies and entrepreneurship skills that provide an intellectual structure for understanding the issues of how entrepreneurial firms recognize potential of an innovation on time, how they implement the right strategies to exploit the innovation, and how to protect their profits from competitors.  The course also explores the increasingly global character of entrepreneurial firms, and how successful technology companies compete across cultures, markets and nations.",

It has nothing to do with technology, you should treat it as a CC course instead.<br /><br />The actual teaching deviates from the syllabus quite a lot, the actual dates of assignments release/submission and lecture topics are quite off from what has announced.

On the other hand, he seems really &quot;hea&quot;, he does not manage the participation well, also he does not really grade anything.

There are more than 20 students answer questions every lesson, the TA sits at the front and looks forward, the professor jumps around and is unlikely recognise our face. No namecard, no parti card, and everyone just pretends having answered question at the end of each class and writes their names on a paper for Prof's grading.<br /><br />Even worse, no any assignment, exam, nor the presentation got released with scores. It is literally a black hole, I submitted everything but got returned nothing -.- The professor even once missed the submission date to set up Canvas assignment for uploading the case studies, what a joke.<br /><br />I got unknown in participation, unknown in case assignments, unknown in project, unknown in final exam, then got an A-<br /><br />Very interesting case, i totally have no idea whether the grading is good or bad, lmao",
            "comment_workload": "Low workload. You will need to do a presentation at the end, but thats common. Several case studies are needed and perhaps they are the only workloads.<br /><br />Final exam questions are vague af and I am not sure if studying helps. Yet, there will be some questions related to the cases so remember to digest all cases carefully even you did not do the previous case assignments seriously.",

They were open-end questions so you wouldn't feel stressed to get the &quot;right&quot; answer. <br /><br />There might be a 1-page reading at the end of the lecture. He would give you a couple of minutes and would encourage the class to discuss ideas based on it. <br /><br />He started class right on time, not even 1 minute late. <br /><br />There's a group project which asked students to prepare a pitch and business plan for a start-up idea to be launched in the Chinese/HK market. It could be any idea - exiting ones, or sth from your own. This business idea would be the core part of your group project for the rest of your semester.",
            "comment_teaching": "The ideas about entrepreneurship and innovation were easy to understand. The prof explained them clearly with a lot of real-life examples. <br /><br />Around 1 week before the Mid Term, he would post the lecture videos on Canvas.<br /><br />For the group project, he was very willing to meet with students to discuss how to improve our presentation. He would post time slots on Canvas and you could sign up.",

There were a lot of short essay questions that would ask you the pros &amp; cons of sth.
