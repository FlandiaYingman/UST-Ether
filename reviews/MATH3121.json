I attended most of the class and jot notes, and spend ~2 days (you dun hv time to do more than that, and personally I dun like to do exercises or past paper...but I guess in regular sem, I would be more deadline fighter since I also hv other courses workload...) for revision for quiz/exam every week. I do the hw every week for about 4 hours. I think I work really hard and spend many time on this course, and I won't have so much time to do so in regular sem...but still fair workload!!!<br />(HAHA I keep encouraging people take course in summer/winter sem! )<br /><br />But the bad things is...the time crush with other common core is very serious, so you won't have chance to take other common core/course when you take this course :D (Look at the schedule and you will understand :( )",
