            "comment_teaching": "TL;DR: He put a lot of effort into teaching. However, if you want a fair grading scheme and stable exam arrangement, avoid him at all cost.<br /><br />Fair to say, I must admit that he put a lot of effort into teaching. He makes handwritten notes. The concept explaining is fine.<br /><br />You may want to ask why I still give E on teaching anyway if he teaches well? The answer is the exam arrangements. For those who don't know what happened, long story short, due to some students faced technical issues with the platform used in the midterm, WeBWorK, the midterm is CANCELLED, while the final exam arrangement is simply unfair.<br /><br />Below is what happened to the midterm in details:<br />The main reason leading to the midterm being cancelled is because if students do not perform any preview/grade test in the WeBWorK, the system will assume the student is idling and log out automatically after 30 minutes.<br /><br />Some students were like speedrunning the midterm for more than 30 minutes without checking the answer. When they submit the answers, the system logged out so their answers are gone. However, Prof. Qian did NOT inform us about this earlier. More than 20% of students were affected (He said he correctly received the answers from 80% of the students, but some of them actually faced this problem also. Though they had enough time to rewrite all the answers and submit.)<br /><br />After informed about this issue, Prof. Qian announced that the midterm is cancelled. And he told the student who took the midterm &quot;just treat it as an EXERCISE&quot;, and state that the grade weight will be shifted to the final, &quot;having 90% final is NORMAL&quot;. WHAT? Professor, do you think our time spent studying the midterm of this course is a joke?<br /><br />On the night after the midterm, Prof. Qian and the TAs finally come up with the decision that the midterm is considered valid and a makeup midterm will be arranged, but at last, since some student think this solution is not fair for all students, it is announced again cancelled the next day, with a more reasonable Homework 30%/Final 70% weighting.<br /><br />I am extremely dissatisfied with the arrangement. Judging from how he told us to treat the midterm as an exercise, I feel that he is irresponsible on this issue. He is supposed to be responsible for knowing the potential technical problems that will be faced by students, especially with the fact that WeBWorK has been adapted for a long time in HKUST. But no, he did not tell us about this problem.<br /><br /><br />And now, for the final:<br />The arrangement of the final is a total disaster. It is basically the mix of all inconvenience and panic. In contrast to the midterm, they completely banned calculators and formula sheet in the final exam. It also required us to use a scanner app to scan our answers.<br /><br />And you know what? They made this twice as inconvenient by forcing us to use the scanner app on another device (This means you have to bring 3 devices into the exam, one for viewing questions, one for Zoom and one for scanning), and not providing any alternatives in case we don’t have or can’t borrow the third device from anyone, while a laptop and a mobile phone should be enough for such kind of exam.<br />(Some may argue that he provided us with a way to use the only laptop and mobile phone. However, according to exam instructions, you will need an EXTERNAL webcam.)<br /><br />The time distribution of the final exam is also inhuman. In total, there are 8 questions. They split the exam into FOUR parts with 2 questions each. For each part, we are given ONLY 20 minutes to answer. Such arrangement would make student more panic if they, unfortunately, got disconnected in any parts, as this takes time to re-connect. Some may think this applies to all online exams, but in this case, the penalty of re-connecting is more costly as the answering time is already short.<br />(For me, I got disconnected on part 4. Luckily I managed to think of and open a Wi-Fi hotspot to finish the exam. But in the end, I left one question almost blank because of this.)<br /><br />If you do follow the exam rules legitimately, this means that you have only 20 minutes to answer the question by writing down all the steps clearly, while you have to write down your information on EACH PAGE (Considering that you submit your work on Canvas, this is actually useless. But these are real exam rules: They need you to do that but you can only bring in BLANK papers, even though they do not check the papers in the end).<br />After that, we have only around 6 minutes to scan and upload our answers, and 2 minutes toilet break and prepare for the next part (This is extremely harsh to students who take the exam in some UG hall like hall 6, such that the toilet has a distance between rooms).<br />Maybe they think this helps to prevent cheaters but ironically this doesn’t help at all (Since they don’t open the mic and check monitors). This exam is definitely intense. I think it would be less harsh if they split it into fewer parts so we have more answering time for each question on average.<br /><br />To sum up the arrangement of the final exam, it is basically making exam that COULD be easier into potential nightmare fuel by shortening time to answer and upload, while banning any assistance (Even though this happens to all math courses), wasting our time by writing unnecessary information and forcing us to use extra devices. This arrangement, I think, brings inconvenience to many students.<br /><br /><br />Although such arrangements would be less likely to happen again since HKUST is switching back to F2F in the next semester, I think these arrangements proved why you should avoid this professor AT ALL COSTS if you want more manageable exams.",
            "comment_grading": "Original grading scheme:<br />Assignments: 10%<br />Midterm: 30%<br />Final: 60%<br /><br />Right after midterm (Please see teaching for more details):<br />Assignments: 10%<br />Final: 90%<br /><br />The night after midterm, the grading scheme remains the same as before midterm.<br /><br />The next day of midterm:<br />Assignments: 30%<br />Final: 70%<br /><br />You may find 90% final is ridiculous. But it's ok because Professor Qian said It is NORMAL in UST.<br /><br />If you really don't want to face such a ridiculous grading scheme, I suggest you take it in the fall semester instead (Likely to be taught by Dr. Ho). As I read from others' review, Prof. Qian allows students to not attend midterm and &quot;all in&quot; final, while unable to make sure that the difficulty of the assessments are fair enough to let students taking two different paths (30% midterm + 60% final, or 90% final) get a fair grade (This was done for at least two semesters taught by him). What makes this matter worse is that he doesn’t take the maximum score of these two pathways.<br /><br />It is horrible that Prof. Qian over-relying on curving to try to make the grade balanced while making the exams long with tight time. Curving seems to make the grade curve more flexible in case most students cannot finish all questions in time, but this simply brings frustration and defeat.<br />Also, since he allowed students to skip midterm and “all-in” final in the past, curving becomes more unreliable as students were split into two groups with disproportionate efforts paid.<br /><br />Imagine you have tried hard in midterm and got like 80 to 90, but it ended up cancelled. You headed on and still gave your best shot on the Final but end up getting 60. Is this fair to you? Definitely not, since you could have got at least a sub-grade higher if midterm is not completely cancelled, right?<br /><br />My score is as follows:<br />Homework: 100% (You can repeatedly attempt and get 100%)<br />Final: 83/100 (Mean for L2: 62)<br />Final grade: A (88.1%)<br /><br />In fact, my grade actually took the benefit from the new grading scheme, but I’m sorry that I still have to point out how ridiculous this sudden change of grading scheme is. Not to mention that the midterm is held at around week 11, near the end of the semester.",
            "comment_workload": "For assignments, it is basically easy to handle. All 12 WeBWorK homework was opened at the beginning of the semester. So the students with solid calculus background may complete the first few early as a head start to minimize the worry later in the semester.<br /><br />For the midterm, it is a WeBWorK-based midterm. This means you do it like how you do the homework. It consists of 28 questions modified from the homework. Even though we have calculators and formula sheets, however, we have to finish them in 1 hour, making the time is very tight to finish (And Prof. Qian did not expect us to finish it). Even though you may have spent days and days to clear the concept, did past papers and Classviva exercises, reviewed the WeBWorK questions, but sorry, technical problems, your efforts and time are in vain!<br /><br />The final exam is a written exam. There are 8 long questions, but we are only given on average 10 minutes to finish one question (The arrangement on other items is also frustrating, see teaching section for more). Because of this, in order to get high marks, you have to train yourself to catch up with the pace, i.e. finish a question and list out all its steps within 10 minutes.<br />Despite such a harsh arrangement, I personally think the overall execution of this exam is at least better than the midterm.<br /><br />According to one of my friend who studied in the 20-21 fall semester (Taught by Dr. Ho), I would expect the pace of this course would be rather relaxing, but my expectation simply broke apart after the cancellation of the midterm. Having a written exam is fine for me, but the pace of the exam is simply too tense.",

During the midterm, some of the students said that their exam input was gone because of the webwork (maybe they didn't refresh the page??). As the answers inputted cannot be recovered, the professor decided to cancel the WHOLE midterm exam.<br /><br />Students were very dissatisfied with the arrangement of the midterm. The professor has told us that the midterm is just taken as EXERCISE and 90% weight of final is normal in UST when he told us that the midterm is canceled, while students may study for 4 or 5 days for a SINGLE fucking midterm. It is sacrilege for a highly educated professor to say such words that contempt the efforts of students. Before this incident, I, as a student, trusted the teaching system works on HKUST, but now I will surely doubt that is the professor's decision absolute and if it is normal to &quot;all in final&quot; in UST? There is no way that student to yell out their voice. It is unacceptable that a professor said such irresponsible words. It is the responsibility of the professor to check whether the platform is suitable to have the exam. <br /><br />Students who timed out from webwork also have their responsibility (I am not blaming the victim but just want to say) because their didn't constantly refresh their webwork page. It is not the first day that we use webwork, we all should know that webwork got a damn afk system that will log u out once u afk for 30 mins. Why the f they didn't refresh the webwork page during the midterm? WTF???",

            "comment_content": "To be perfectly honest the contents of the course itself its quite good, it's an introduction to doing calculus in a 3d space and dealing with multi-variable functions. However, with bad course construction, grading, and shit arrangement overall. What should have been an integral course in your engineering degree, became a full-on burden. In the end, courses like this make me wonder why I pay 70 000 HKD to attend this uni, I should have been paid to have to deal with this shit show of a course",

Not because he did not understand the material, but because he was just bad a teaching in general. The only saving grace for me is that the TA Tommy was really good and he provides good tutorials. <br /><br />Teaching assignments like this makes me question what is the department thinking. Why would you hand the assignment to teach an integral math course for engineers to understand and fully comprehend to such a an incompetent teacher. Do they want us to fail?<br /><br />Extra note the final exam hall was open late by 20 minutes, and I kid u not, the professor was screaming to hurry it up when the gates open glancing over the fact that it was their own fault to begin with.",

Considering this is a pretty challenging course that introduces many new concepts and elementary concepts that can be built upon, the fact that it had only a final made it very hard to gauge your actual understanding of the course and you can just easily feel left behind.",

(He is an email sadist)<br /><br />2. Additional Examples on Canvas <br />Dr. Ho won't cover the additional examples in class but I still recommend you to print them out and understand the materials. These help you to get a concrete and integrated understanding between topics. <br /><br /><br />Tutorials: <br />My tutor is Tommy Cheng. Although he speaks Konglish and broken English really well, he is able to demonstrate extra examples which are not covered in lectures. His tutorials are basically using the notes prepared by Einstein and the whole tutorial is simply examples drilling.",
            "comment_grading": "Two types of grading are provided this semester. <br /><br />Scheme I: 10% WebWork, 30% Midterm, 60% Final <br />Scheme II: 10% WebWork, 90% Final <br /><br />Webwork *6<br />Midterm 15-MCQs with 90 mins <br />Final (changed to Canvas online exam due to nCOV-19 and social movement) <br />12-MCQs 1hr <br /><br />It turns out that most students didn't perform well in Midterm due to its difficulty in asking integrated concepts and applications. However, the final exam is much easier than expected and the time provided is quite sufficient. I wonder why there are still a lot of students work poorly and the mean is that low.<br /><br />Statistics: <br />Webwork Full Mark <br />Midterm 36/45 --&gt; 80/100 (Mean: 24/45, S.D 10.6, &gt;1.13 SD)<br />Final 44/48 --&gt; 92/100 (Mean 28/48, S.D 10.2)<br />Overall grading follow Scheme II <br />Total Score: 92.5%<br />Grade: A+ <br />(WTF I can't imagine I've two 2000-level math courses with A+, I completely screwed up for 1000-level Math courses)<br /><br />HHM hurray!

But I would say the workload is manageable if you really do a lot of hard-work working on exercises and concepts clarifications. <br /><br />The WebWork are generally shit, you can just finish all the required work and simply omit it during revision. <br /><br />My way of revising the course: <br />1. Read and understand the lecture notes with examples, concepts and proofs. Review the additional notes posted on Canvas.<br />2. Work on most tutorial exercises and textbook exercises as supplement (Textbook: Calculus Early Transcedental)<br />3. Find extra examples and application problems onliine since Dr. Ho didn't cover all the tricky parts and techniques. Personally suggest watching Youtube videos provided by Prof. Leonard, this is my major source for understanding the advanced examples and computational tricks in deep.",

If you know how to do the set-up, you can do anything the teacher throws at you. please get comfortable with polar regions because they are a life saver. You don't have to worry about spherical coordinates in this course. <br /><br />triple integration is just double integration except its annoying as frick. if you ever want to change the order of integration(which in double integration, you have to draw the 2d region), ur gonna have to draw out a nice 3d surface, or a ton of 2d regions and use ur brain and figure out what to do from there. you better pray you don't have to do triple integral bound changes on the exam :) ALSO, there is a way to avoid trig sub that isn't taught in class. Its called the jacobian, please for the love of God learn jacobian substitution on your own. <br /><br />Vector fields: we basically skipped everything useful this semester &gt;_&lt; we can do line integrals over vector fields and conservative vector fields. But we never learnt green's, stoke's or divergence theorem, which are really important for engineering courses. <br /><br /><br />looking back, i regret not doing 2023.

Cuz this sem was 75% final, 25% webwork. Very nice. <br /><br />This combined with the online exam format which is hella stressful, made the exam season very funn't. <br /><br />I recommend following up with the graders when you feel like they have marked you unfairly.<br /><br />IF YOUR ANSWER IS NOT THE SAME AS THE KEY, THEY MIGHT UNDERLINE SOMETHING RANDOM AND MARK YOU OFF!!!(not just in this class but also in elec2420 this happened to me &gt;:( ) <br /><br />SOME GRADERS LIKE TO TAKE OFF WAY MORE MARKS THAN NECESSARY. I flipped bounds on 1 integral, made a small algebraic mistake, and got 2 out of 13 for that question. (sadly the grade was already set before I could argue my case ;-; so please make sure you argue with the graders as soon as possible if you feel like you deserve more points)<br />While initially, graders will be very strict, they are actually very nice and will be ok with giving you a few points back :)<br /><br />In the end: <br />webwork: 93.34%<br />Exam: 81% mean: 52.73<br />Total: 84.09-&gt; A<br /><br />Putting other reviews in the picture, if you want an A, it looks like you need 25-30% score above mean to secure an A",

These knowledge will be useful when you learn further in your major (eg. MECH2210 for MECH/AE students).",
            "comment_teaching": "In general, Professor Ho teaches in a slow, steady, yet easy-to-understand way. As a local professor, his accent is understandable, and he also maintain fairly vibrant interactions in lectures. While previously reported that the course's notes must be taken from his lectures, all lecture notes are available on Canvas this semester.<br /><br />One of his specialty is using paper and coloured pens instead of using pre-made PowerPoint during teaching, which helps with understanding the 3D coordinate system and drawing. Examples discussed in lectures are also dissected in details and guided step-to-step, with more emphasis on application than proof, though you can listen to his explanation should you know learn deeper.<br /><br />I'll consider him similar to Merkel: not exceptionally shiny or attractive in teaching, but with sufficient experience, he also teaches well.<br /><br />Speaking of the TA, Ho Ming Leung is as unremarkable as other MATH TAs I've experienced before: Simply finding today tutorial's notes, and do questions in front of us, in which I mostly uses the time to do questions by myself. Another criticism is that he used unproportionate time to explain some easy contents, like the answer of one presentation question, while simply don't mention about other contents (like how to solve midterm questions) we'll concern more.<br /><br />P.S. As mentioned by other students, Professor Ho is known for repeatedly sending email notifications to us (probably on average, 5-6 emails per notification). While regular cleanup can be a solution, your email system organizes forwarded/replied emails into a single one, so you may also opt to delete all notifications when he don't repeat them and you consider they're useless.",

            "comment_workload": "Workload is not that much. At least compared with my another compulsory MATH2111, the workload here is somewhat friendly.<br /><br />1. Webwork <br />For this semester, only 6 Webwork homework, which is less than my expectation (For my MATH2111 there are like 11-12 homework in one semester...)<br /><br />2. Presentation<br />The presentation is a little bit troublesome. You are given a question and you need to solve it and make a recording, explaining the steps. Nevertheless, the question itself is not that complicated. Moreover, there are only ONE question only. Solving it is not a big deal. If you don't get stuck for too long, the time of solving+recording may even less than one webwork, which is actually quite friendly indeed.<br /> <br />However, find a way to check answer (google, wolframalpha, your friends, etc.) because if your answer is wrong, you will be in big trouble.<br /><br />3. Mid-term &amp; Final exam<br />I don't know whether Dr.Ho is lazy and just want to scan the MC answer sheet by machine, or he wants us to experience what Mark Six is or whatever, even though it comes back to physical exam, the format is still ALL MC. Therefore, be very careful as one question may cost you one subgrade. In contrast, sometimes if you get stuck, guessing may bring you unexpectedly good result (If this happens, you should go and buy Mark Six)<br /><br />For preparing exams, there are no other way -- just do exercises (Of course you need to make sure you have clear concepts beforehand). Dr.Ho will provide a set of revision exercises. You can also do tutorial exercise or even re-do the example question in lecture notes as the exam will just ask some similar things. Nothing tricky at all.<br /><br />Don't think the exam is very easy though. Make sure you can compute things quickly and accurately. Even though the example question and exam asks the same thing, the given expression may become very horrible in exam. <br /><br />For example, a given vector field in lecture notes may be just &lt;x, x+y&gt;. But in my final exam, it becomes an expression with four to five terms, with product, quotient or even square roots inside, which make the computation become extremely tedious = =",

The real calculus part comes after midterms which is not too difficult if you are good in single variable calculus and imagining stuff in 3D. But line integrals and vector fields might be a bit challenging later. <br /><br />Midterm exam is a piece of cake so mean is high but finals was a bit more challenging.",

Even though, he does only 1 problem per section in class, its pretty easy to understand. But you need to practice plenty on your own to do well. He also makes jokes but is very strict about using mobile phones in class. <br /><br />Yi gave very good practice worksheets which if you could do on your own, would be enough to prepare for exams. However, his answer sheet is very basic and does not show how he went on with the problem, maybe only has the 1st and last step and no explanation in between. He also speeded through every tutorial which was a nightmare for us. So I suggest asking him in email or after class about the problems.",

Within the whole disaster, Prof. Qian's attitude is the biggest problem. What does he mean by &quot;Take the mid-term as an exercise?&quot; (although it was indeed a good one as all kinds of questions were covered) For students who had prepared the mid-term for weeks, their efforts became a joke due the negligence of the teaching team. Though I did not get a satisfactory grade in my view in mid-term and I actually took advantage of the grading scheme change, I still felt angry for those who spent a great deal of time and got good grades in mid-term. <br /><br />AS A WARM REMINDER, DO NOT TAKE ANY COURSE TAUGHT BY HIM IN ON-LINE MODE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GOOD MOOD AFTER AND BEFORE THE EXAM.",

(actually I can say that 100% weight is left on it since the hws allow unlimited attempt) Although for the teaching team, it is easy to distinguish different levels of students, for the students who work hard for the whole semester, they may lose one sub-grade or more due to a careless make caused by anxiety.",

But hey hard work forever pays! The MATH TAs notes absolutely helps, I'd say they help more than the lecture, so if you are a deadline fighter and time is running out, go watch the TA's tutorials and work on the TA's note questions rather than binge watching lecture videos and then try attempting problems.",

They were spread apart pretty well so I never had to spend more than an hour or two per homework. They are pretty simple questions assuming you read the lecture notes or follow everything in class. <br /><br />This was another online sem so 10% of the grade was actually from individual presentations. Frankly, these are a joke. They are super simple questions that you spend 10 minutes solving (max) and another 10 minutes (max) recording yourself explaining. <br /><br />Studying recommendations: if you feel like you understand Calculus for the most part, you might as well not study until 75% of the course is over. I highly, highly recommend you use &quot;Einstein Kong's Tutorial Website&quot; for concise lecture notes with practice questions from the textbook and detailed answers for them too. Just google it and you'll find it. They are great for recapping and practicing for the final",

(unless you actually want to learn more, then take Dr Ho's class). Also, we ran out of time to teach Green's theorem which made the course easier as well. I think he teaches quite well, provides some simple and good examples and the class is not extremely boring. The first few lectures were pretty simple and rather basic content but get exponentially harder later on especially topic 4 and 5. He will do some pretty difficult proofs in class but do not worry about those as this course is purely computational, so just understand the calculations and how to get to the answer (the process is important). Lecture video is also provided so there is no need to really attend lectures. <br /><br />For tutorials, just a very short tutorial exercise, teaching for tutorials were not great but it is ok. A lot fewer exercises to practice from than teaching staff from MSC. Could skip it as TA's notes are online and he just goes through the exercise. Just use them for practice for exams.",

If you are a deadline fighter, a lot of the homework later on (especially the integrals) could just be done online as long as you plug in the correct integral and its limits (saves time for computation).<br /><br />To do well in this course, also make sure you understand at general one-variable calculus and are able to do questions from there well e.g. from 1000 math courses or else you might struggle with the integrals computationally. But I think overall the questions in exams computationally (not conceptionally) should be easier than in math 1000s.<br /><br />For exams, I suggest just use tutorials for practice. It is pretty sufficient for Prof. Qian's exams which are relatively easy as its nearly all computational questions (one question in final about different surfaces). Understanding the concept is most important as it gets pretty abstract later on, so make sure you read through the lecture notes.",

            "comment_content": "Green's theorem and divergence theorem are not coveres this sem. Other contents are same as other reviews<br /><br />You might want to take math2023 if you want to learn really decent stuff about mutivariable Calculus.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof QIAN did a really good job preparing the notes and lectures. And for some important concepts, he will explain it twice both in Engilsh and Chinese. This is actually quite suprising and may be an advantage for Chinese speakers.",
            "comment_grading": "I see that many students have posted reviews blaming Prof QIAN fore his grading scheme arrangements especially after what happened in the midterm. I actually have a different point of view, for those who hate and suffered from this kind of arrangement, please accept my sincere sympathy. But I will not blame Prof QIAN for this eventual arrangement as personnaly I think this is already the best arrangement after what happened in the midterm.<br /><br />1. The Prof doesn't hope for the technical issues during the midterm either. he tried his best to arrange a midterm under such a difficult period, and he was willing to hear from students' different advice after what happened, at least we have nothing to blame for his attitude.<br />2. Some may think that voiding the midterm and &quot;taking it as a good exercise&quot; is irresponsible. But the fact is that, the influence of the technical issue in the midterm is high enough to affect a lot more than the students who didn't have their answers recorded. Firstly, during the last 15 min of the exam , the whole proctoring zoom meeting is filled with noise about students and professors discussing about the technincal issues, for an exam that requires you to finish 30 questions in 1 hour, I don't need to tell you how tight is the time and how annoying it is to hear all that noise in the last 15 mins of the exam. So the noise effect is one thing. What's more is that many students who have score recorded didn't get their real score recorded. Like if he/she submitted once at 20 min, then he/she didn't preview and submitted again at last, the second time the answers will not be recorded and he/she can only receive points for the first 20min answering period. So even with a &quot;recorded score&quot;, as 80% of the students did, the recorded score may not be the real deserved score.<br />3. Many blamed that all the efforts studying for the midterm become a waste due to the arrangements. But isn't it our duty as a student to understand the contents of courses as best as we can? the studying for the midterm will be helpful for the final as well and certainly helful for understanding the whole course.<br /><br />Now to the eventual grading scheme. 30%HW+70%Final, this is already better than math1014 which has 75%final. So I am satisfied enough with his arrangements. He couldn't have done much better. But I do hope Prof Qian can learn a lesson from the midterm techinal issues and make this a even better course in the future. For those who took advantage from this arrangement change, Congratulations! For those who suffered loss, please accept my sincere sympathy but let's not blame the prof too much of this. He already tried to make it as fair as possible.",
