        "description": "Todayâ€™s business leaders must have the ability to analyze numbers and systems and simultaneously to engage in active, thoughtful development of people. Manager employee interactions have largely replaced comprehensive organizational career management systems as the primary building block of learning and professional growth. However, managers often lack the skills to build collaborative relationships that facilitate the learning, performance and development of their people. Manager's skill in empowering and coaching employees affects performance, morale and attrition. Approximately half the course will be an introduction to theories, models and tools of people development. The rest of the course will be devoted to learning and practicing applied coaching skills that students can take back to their jobs to enhance their individual growth and organizational success. Grade P or F.",
