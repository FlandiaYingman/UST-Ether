            "comment_content": "1. Official textbook: Differential geometry of curves and surfaces, do Carmo; and instructor's lecture notes (which is another copy of the textbook). <br /><br />2. Personal comment:<br /><br />-&gt; In overall, the instructor follows the flow of the textbook for teaching material.<br />-&gt; Unlike the previous course instructor, the teaching material is quite normal and standard. Therefore there are over 40 students registering this course, which is double of the past figure. <br />-&gt; After taking this course, an immediate application is to look at professor Fong's 4033 lecture notes for high dimensional counterpart of the course content, or start the journey of Manifolds. <br />-&gt; Continue from above, it seems that the most essential character of this course is to serve as a doorway to enter the world of modern (Riemannian) geometry.<br /><br />3. Course structure:<br /><br />==========Part One: Curve theory========<br /><br />TL;DR: Tangent, normal, binormal, curvature, torsion. The crucial things to link them are differentiation and dot product.<br /><br />-&gt; Regular curve and arc-length parametrization<br />-&gt; Frenet's formula (linking tangent, normal, curvature, binormal and torsion)<br />-&gt; Plane curve (The case of zero torsion)<br />-&gt; Curvature and torsion in general case (What if we do not have A.L.P?)<br />-&gt; F.T. of local theory of curve (Given &quot;curvature function&quot; and &quot;torsion function&quot;, an ALP curve can be recovered up to rigid motion)<br /><br />=========Part Two: Regular surface========<br /><br />TL;DR: The 'main stage' of this course is built here, because all main stuff are based on regular surfaces.<br /><br />-&gt; Definition of regular surface<br />-&gt; Some examples: Level sets, graph, torus...<br />-&gt; Parametric surface, coordinate curve<br />-&gt; First fundamental form (Representing intrinsic properties: Sat, geometric properties like arc-length, area and angle can be expressed in terms of it)<br /><br />========Part Three: Gaussian curvature========<br /><br />TL;DR: Definition of Gaussian curvature via different ways. Gauss curvature is another geometric quantity that appears frequently in the rest of the course.<br /><br />-&gt; Orientation of regular surface (How to define the direction of regular surface?)<br />-&gt; Gauss map the related propeties<br />-&gt; Second fundamental form (Representing extrinsic properties)<br />-&gt; First definition of Gauss curvature, via &quot;eigenvalue&quot; and &quot;eigenvector&quot;<br />-&gt; Classification of points, in terms of sign of Gauss curvature<br />-&gt; Other related definitions like normal curvature, principal curvature, asymptotic curve, line of curvature...<br />-&gt; Second definition of Gauss curvature, via first and second fundamental form<br />-&gt; Some important criterion for identifying line of curvature and asymptotic curve (in terms of fundamental forms)<br />-&gt; Third definition of Gauss curvature, via area of image via Gauss map<br /><br />=========Part Four: Intrinsic geometry========<br /><br />-&gt; Isometry between surfaces<br />-&gt; Identifying isometry via comparison of (coefficients of) first fundamental form<br />-&gt; Christoffel symbol<br />-&gt; Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Gauss Curvature only depends on first fundamental form; it is completely an intrinsic concept!)<br />-&gt; Vector field<br />-&gt; Covariant derivative (Projection of derivative of tangent onto tangent space)<br />-&gt; Geodesic curvature, and various ways for calculation <br />-&gt; Parallel vector field: Field with zero geodesic curvature<br />-&gt; Geodesics: Parametrized curve whose tangent is parallel field along the curve<br />-&gt; Calculus of variation: Particles walk through geodesics<br />-&gt; Gauss-Bonnett theorem: Angle sum of triangle depends on the Gauss curvature of surface",

Maturity in linear algebra, with a good understanding of the elementary contents as well as the dual spaces, multi-linear transformations etc. (he will cover these topics with one lecture so don't worry if you have never encountered such things);<br />2. Mastering the basic calculus contents, with the multi-variable version included;<br />3. Familiarity of the commutative diagrams will save your tears much, though it is not required at all.<br /><br />II. Contents:<br />Linear/Affine Spaces &amp; Rigid Motions;<br />Smoothness &amp; Regular Curves;<br />Curvatures and Torsions &amp; the Frenet-Serret Frames;<br />Local Canonical Forms of Curves;<br />Regular Surfaces &amp; Diffeomorphisms;<br />The Inverse Function Theorem &amp; the Implicit Function Theorem;<br />Tangent Planes &amp; Local Canonical Forms of the Regular Surfaces;<br />Linearization of the Maps between the Manifolds;<br />The Gauss Map;<br />Linear Forms (which I mentioned in I.1);<br />Total Differentials and the Fundamental Forms of the Manifolds;<br />The Local Tangent and Cotangent Frames and the Local Expressions of the Fundamental Forms;<br />The Complex Structures &amp; the Area Forms<br />Lie Derivatives;<br />Covariant Derivatives (covered but not required in the exam)",
            "comment_teaching": "Good teaching. Nothing much to say.<br /><br />He is quite patient and willing to answer students'&nbsp;&nbsp;questions. Any difficulties in understanding the course materials will be figured out<br />and explained later. Try to follow his thinking patterns. <br /><br />Sit in the front of the classroom HELPS.<br /><br />No worry for his English, which is among the best of Math Dept.",

Make sure you read his blog regularly, and attend the lectures please, for his explaining of the materials are essential for understanding and mastering.<br /><br />WARNING:<br />Don't enroll the course without pre-requisites fulfilled!<br />Don't enroll the course without pre-requisites fulfilled!<br />Don't enroll the course without pre-requisites fulfilled!<br /><br />The pre-requisites refer to the parts above mentioned.",
            "comment_workload": "Average workload.<br /><br />The homework assignments are not too demanding.<br /><br />The main obstacles are usually found out to be the thinking instead of the working/calculating. We are really supposed to investigate the contents thoroughly and scrutinise the relation between the new concepts and the old. <br /><br />There is nothing not understandable if you think; if there is, think twice.
