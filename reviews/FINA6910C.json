        "description": "The primary objective of the course is to understand how the theories behind derivatives and portfolio optimization are applied in practice as part of quantitatively driven trading strategies. \nIn the first part of the course, we will discuss how practitioners apply the option theories in practice to manage a portfolio of derivatives.  In the second part, we consider the portfolio optimization as a quantitative investment process and discuss various practical aspects of implementing the theories in practice.\nLastly, we will review the latest trends and market developments in China and the rest of the world.\nThough the course does not require sophisticated technical skills, a good understanding of option theories and portfolio optimization is pre-requisite. Some familiarity with thinking in programming terms (e.g. if-then) will be helpful.",
