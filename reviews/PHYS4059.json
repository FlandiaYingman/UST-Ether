            "comment_content": "The course covers a range of topics from optimization of resources to logistics and image restoration as well as machine learning in the end.<br />Topics included linear programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming, decision-making, network flow models, project management, and queuing analysis. <br />We used physics concepts and excel to optimize resource allocation in a company, find shortest and fastest paths, simulating demand using random numbers, supply and logistic hubs using inflow and outflow of goods and finally we covered Bayes' Theorem and its relevance in information processing. Lastly we covered prediction using various techniques including machine learning.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Wong provides a very clear outline of what is expected throughout the semester and follows the syllabus provided. He takes a lot of time to introduce calculations and especially how to use Excel to make your life easier. You may be surprised what you are able to do with it and if you get nothing else out of this course, you will definitely become proficient at using it!<br />His English is excellent and because the class was very small the atmosphere in class was very positive.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading consists of weekly classwork (allowed to hand in next day), weekly tutorials (also allowed to hand in next day), midterm exam in class, small project and final project instead of final exam. <br />There are also 4 15 minute quizzes throughout the semester out of which the 3 best ones are counted. The grading is absolutely fair and as long as you continuously keep up with the work you will be rewarded accordingly.",
            "comment_workload": "The weekly classwork and labs can take some time to finish, but as long as you understand the content it should be not much trouble. The TA and professor are also always willing to help you out if you are stuck.<br />The quizzes and midterm are based exactly on classwork/ lab problems and it is always clearly announced what to revise to be able to do well.<br />If you are interested in the topics it is quite easy to do.",
