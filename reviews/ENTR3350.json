This course requires students to go out into global society and industry companies beyond (China, Hong Kong, Korea) for seeking and defining a global user-centered design problem by themselves, to develop the engineering design alternative to solve it, and then to build a working critical function prototype. Students will collaborate through online tools as well as 3 face-to-face meetings throughout the semester in the three respective campuses. This course provides various lectures such as marketing, industrial design, patent law, creative thinking, conceptual design methodology, and case studies in problem ideation.
