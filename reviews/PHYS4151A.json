        "description": "This course encourages self-initiation and practicing experiential learning through hands-on experience. Students are expected to develop a study and fabrication plan at the start of the course. Under the supervision of the course instructor, students will design, build or fabricate the needed parts and assemble the parts to produce functional prototypes or units to demonstrate the proposed physical laws in the areas related to physics, e.g. mechanics, electronics, waves (optics or sound), electromagnetism, or model physics. By the end of the course, students are required to write a final report for the project and perform an oral presentation. The project may be extended for a second term for extra credits subject to satisfactory performance and project report. Students may also repeat the course for credits if different topics are taken. For PHYS students with instructor's approval only.",
