        "description": "This course aims at bringing to students a broadened understanding of drawing through taking a fresh and experimental approach to the study of various media. Students are guided through a discovery journey of drawing to learn how to \"read\" drawings, how lines and space are organized, what visual effects or concepts are communicated, and to develop a creative approach in problem solving. They will experiment with line, tone, texture, scale and composition, and work with different media and tools to approach a broad range of subjects from still life to abstract pattern.",
