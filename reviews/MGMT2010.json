        "description": "This course presents and exemplifies three major traditions of ethical thought in East and West moral philosophy - namely utilitarianism, principle-based ethics and virtue-based ethics. Employing guest speakers, lectures, cases, contemporary readings, role-plays, fieldwork, reflective student writing, and discussion groups, the course engages students in a serious consideration of their own ethical standards as applied to their present academic environment and their future careers. Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions. For Business students only.",

Never reg her or you will always regret. She is the worst professor I've met so far in HKUST. She grades very subjectively while not giving advice or guidance to students. She may only sometimes give you harsh comments in tutorials when reviewing your projects but never help you. Also, no one knows how she grade, she gives the scores as she wishes.<br />I suggest switching to lecture like Mark's, as I have many friends getting A range with just normal (non-extraordinary) performance.

Theoretically, I didn't do too much in group presentation. Just to ensure your group members don't refer you as free-rider and if everything is fine, you won't get a bad grade. <br /><br />40% integrated task: an essay typing test which is simply bluffing. Providing adequate examples and link with his teachings as much as possible. Most of the students get most of the points in the previous sessions so this task determines your final grade. Writing more than or around 1000 words and bootlicking him in the task are strongly recommended.<br /><br />100% impression: laugh at his jokes to show you are listening to him and answers his questions/share your thoughts at least once per lesson.

            "comment_content": "He is a new professor in teaching ethics, thus his teaching syllabus is different from other professors. <br /><br />The first part of the course is introducing ethical theories. Such as duty theory and meta-ethics. To be honest, JC does not have the skills to properly explain and teach ethical theories. Usually, he gives us enough time for us to discuss in a small group. His lectures are well prepared and he purchased many materials such as case studies and games for better teaching. <br />For example, the simulation of a zombie virus outbreak, which allows us to consider real-life examples rather than teaching some boring ethical theories. <br />Also, JC invites students to conducts personality tests when teaching Virtue Theories, which is quite interesting.<br /><br />The midterm exam is an exam that requires students to understand the ethical theories.<br /><br />After that, we have a session of research skill teaching workshop, and the good thing is we can go back and review it at any time.<br /><br />The second half of the course is the application of ethics, i.e. debate.<br />JC releases all the topics and the materials, all the students are free to choose which case for debate. The debate structure is UK and East coast US style, which is just each side expressing their argument without any free debate time. For details please go to read the syllabus.<br />After the debate, we have free discussion time where students can freely speak their own opinions for Participation Credits.<br />(Pro tips: Don't rely on the case study as the debate topic is not usually directly related, do your own research instead.)<br /><br />The original plan for the final exam was a two-hour in-class exam. But somehow JC has decided to provide us with a 3.5 days take-home assignment. The questions are quite easy and students are free to write their own points such as challenging the question as long as the claims are valid.",
            "comment_teaching": "He knows who to teach the application of ethics in a better presentation, and he does not speak in monotone.<br /><br />E.g.:In the case &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, his final summary is hiring clients' sons and daughters while don't act like some foolish banks who left much evidence from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the true practice !!!!<br /><br />The true goal of ethical courses is to teach us to do illegal and unethical things legally. And he is constantly teaching us that.<br /><br />He does not provide any tutorial, and because of the National Security Law, he doesn't want any things discussed in the class will be disclosed, thus there is no zoom recording.<br /><br />Besides, he will write comments for your work!!!",

I heard that only one student has shown up in the classroom. If you know who is he, please tell me.<br /><br />JC was planning to give us a quiz for every debate. But finally, there are only 3 and just 2 of them are counted. Those quizzes require you to read the material detailly.<br /><br />Debate is quite funny, you just need many preparations, and luck. Why? There are some crazy students who can give you outstanding points to challenge you. But you don't know you are the positive side or the negative side, JC will decide it just before the debate, so you have to prepare both sides.<br />Well....... JC is just giving us good marks (16-19)<br /><br />The first midterm is a mess, how can we answer 8 difficult questions within 40 minutes??? The mean is quite low, I don't know but some students managed to get very high scores???!!!!<br /><br />The final exam is quite easy, just an essay. And I heard that the marks for everyone are also high.<br /><br /><br />But we don't know why we end up getting that grade. <br />Finally, I get a B.",

Quite a lot of students fall a sleep cuz it is hard to focus on his lecture for nearly 2 hours.<br />I graded B here before, however, after receiving his reply in email, I would say I overrated him as no one can argue with him about the grade no matter how strong your evidences are.

If you ask him for checking grades, he can use a wide range of reasons to justify his grading, which you can't argue at all.<br />Way to get high scores in Parti(40%):<br />You just need to blow water. Lick his shoes FREQUENTLY. Laugh at his poor jokes LOUDLY to show your existence. Do online discussion every week.(no need to be too serious)<br />Way to get high scores in Intergrated task(20%):<br />I dont even know how he grades. I guess adding a lot of reference from reading materials will be useful. Remarks: there are two optional questions, you just need to choose one. And each will require you referring to TWO reading materials (you can decide which two as your reference).<br />For AESP project(40%), it is very important. I fuck up in this part.

Fking on9.<br />The project is also quite demanding. It requires presentation(only 2 members from your group) as well as 11(?) pages final report. Relatively demanding compared to projects in other courses. <br />With all the above workload, this is just a 2 Credit course. Good luck:))))",

            "comment_teaching": "The in-class teaching is quite good. The topics are not boring and they are all worthwhile to take a look at. Mark encourages discussion in the class. However the guidance on how to complete the course work is extremely unclear. There is very limited guidance on how to complete the project. There is only one short meeting with the TA before the actual presentation of the group project. The TA is just doing it to report the progress of each group to MARK, without really offering any help. The guideline on integrated task is even poorer as there is no guideline.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is really subjective and unpredictable. You can't even have a correct expectation towards your grade until it strikes you. There is no grades released for the weekly posting, the integrated test nor the presentation. What's so disastrous about the weekly posting is that there is no clear instruction of when-when is counted as &quot;a week&quot;. So some people assume that it will be sun-sat while the others would assume that is mon-sun. The problem of having a wrong assumption is that you will miss some weeks if you do not post on the exact some day every week. Another thing is class participation. Every 2% will be deducted for every lesson missed. However, in this term, we don't have iPRS as classes are conducted online. Therefore you won't know if late would be counted as absence, and how many minutes should be considered as &quot;late&quot; as well. For the integrated test, the instruction is super unclear that you won't even know what to write for it. There is no marking for the integrated test either so you wouldn't know how you performed. The same happens to group project. There is no grade for the project nor the presentation. Overall speaking, the transparency of this course grading is extremely poor. I got a C+ and I had no idea what had happened.",
            "comment_workload": "If you aim for a good grade, the workload can be heavy. Otherwise, the workload is just mild and you can expect to get a C. First of all class participation is required. Otherwise 2% will be deducted for each class missed and that is disastrous. Also, there is weekly discussion. If you miss it, your grade will be heavily affected as well. You will need to study the reading materials before every lecture so that you can complete the weekly posting and the integrated test, which can actually be quite demanding. The workload for the group project isn't really heavy and I would say it's easy to handle. For this semester, we can decide on the business controversy ourselves and we only need to dig into the pros and cons, the stakeholders and our stance supported by several examples over the world.",

Please make sure you do not skip any of the classes as missing one of them would cost you 2% of the final grade. From my point of view, it's worthwhile to spend the 2-hour time with Mark in class (despite of taking the attendance) as he lectures well and speaks fluent and clear english which you would rarely encounter in UST's courses.<br /><br />And you should be voicing out your opinion at least once per week towards a particular topic in the online discussion.

Try not to be that ambitious as you only have limited time and manpower. <br /><br />Final Exam (20%)<br />A open-book final exam with essay questions only. The whole final exam would be based on the weekly assigned readings. You will be fine if you&nbsp;&nbsp;can skim through them before you sit for the exam and at least understand what those theories are talking about.

I just spoke in some of the lessons, I only shared the news once and I did not post a lot on the online discussion board but it is still alright. For the group project, follow his guidance and marking scheme. The key is to show why the topic is controversial and your group's position. And for the integrated task, include some concepts he taught during lessons and in the ppt/assigned readings then it would be fine. It is not necessary to write many words. At last, I got an A grade.<br /><br />If you have any questions about how the professor grade on something, just email the TA and he would answer you friendly. The grading is not transparent.

Your group need to report your project progress to the TA in the second tutorial. Even though our group hadn't even started doing anything when we met the TA, he was perfectly fine with that xD",

They didn't tell how your postings will be graded too. Time to practice your bullshitting skills here.<br /><br />📃 Group Presentation (35%)<br />You'll be randomly assigned to teams of 6 and come up with a business ethics controversy to present for 10 minutes. The team need to come up with a topic with the format similar to online discussion topics (eg. &quot;Should companies use false advertising?&quot;). Then, discuss this controversy in both pro and con sides, then finally make a group position. <br /><br />📃 Integrated Test (30%)<br />The test is done at the final lesson where you have 2 hours write an essay. There are 2 prompts to choose from and you need to make reference to TWO assigned readings. They are open-ended questions that asks you to discuss ways to combat unethical behaviors in workplace.<br /><br />🔴 Attendance Policy<br />Your final grade will be DEDUCTED for 2% for EVERY SKIPPED LESSON / TUTORIAL!! The professor is scummy enough to hide this information in the middle of the course syllabus document 😈😈 I saw that there were at least 10 people not attending in every lesson...",

The group presentation isn't really that time consuming since you only need to prepare a 10 minute presentation and the workload is spread across 6 teammates.",

Not much revision is needed if you pay full attention in class.<br /><br />For the presentation, you will be grouped by the professor. Seven ppl in one group for a 10 minutes presentation. The workload for the project is not heavy if you team up with hardworking groupmates.<br /><br />The part of active participation is mysterious as I have no clue about how the score is given.

However, he is quite nice and always punctual and never over runs so that is a good thing. <br />Due to his quite peaceful and monotonic Canadian accent, many people find it super easy to fall asleep (or at least dose off) in his class. The class starts off with Mark asking us to share some ethical news or insight (related to the business world) and then he would discuss the reading and then there is a discussion section with your neighbors about the content in your assigned readings. Then he would just talk straight for 1.5 hours and this is the most boring part.",

But I ended up with an easy A given I did not revise at all for the integrated test (no joking, you can bring in as many readings/ lecture ppt in the test as cheat sheet as you want)&nbsp;&nbsp;And also I forgot and missed one week of online discussion board (If not, I think I would have an easy A+;/ )",

Unlike other class which counts for participation, Mark (or the TA) does not mark down the name of the people who answered the questions so like it is all about his impression on you and the more you answer in class and respond to his questions, the more he remembers you and the more chance that you would have a good mark in the participation component and the group presentation component) <br /><br />For my time devoted to the course, honestly it is super easy and chill for me as I never have to revise for it. To sum up my workload for this course, it's just a weekly 10-15 mins online discussion board writing and also a pre class 5 min news search (so I can share something in class lol)",

The 2 quizzes were also simple enough. <br /><br />Assignment 1 involved watching a documentary and answering some questions on it while incorporating the concepts and utilizing the frameworks we learnt in class. Assignment 2 was a simulation with another student (prof paired us up, we couldn't choose our partner), where we had to negotiate and find the best deal for ourselves, while keeping in mind how ethical we wanted to be. <br /> <br />For the group project, we had to create a simulation in which the parties involved faced an ethical dilemma.

Also, she will cold-call the names who did not turn on the camera or rarely participated in the in-class discussions. <br /><br />If you get high scores in midterm or final exam, you will get a appreciation message from her.

However, there was NONE. The whole midterm was like final, all essay questions, requiring you to analyze different scenarios using ethics theory. <br /><br />FYI, questions were like &quot;explain whether sb.'s behavior is ethical&quot; (using whatever ethics theories you like), &quot;what would you do?&quot;, &quot;what is the ethical issue here?&quot; and &quot;what is the effect of your decision?&quot;.<br /><br />As this is a ethics course, you will get full or near-full mark as long as you show your logics clearly and reasonably. It is easy tbh. If you are coming from HKDSE, write your paragraphs like Liberal Studies. It will help you to score high. <br /><br />After the midterm, she gave a debriefing session, telling you what answer was considered as a high-quality answer. It helped me a lot. Following her suggestions will secure a good grade.<br /><br />Eventually everyone gets good scores, extremely high mean as shown at the end.<br /><br />========================================<br />Debate (40%):<br /><br />You are assigned with a case study, and you need to do it like a normal debating competitions. Each students in a group (each group consists of 5-6 students, you can find your own groupmates) are responsible to speak for about 4-5 minutes.<br /><br />One bizarre thing is that we only got to know the motion and our position TWO DAYS BEFORE the debate, which is much different from debate competitions.<br /><br />========================================<br />Participation (20%):<br /><br />The hardest part. <br /><br />You need to share your views during discussion time in class. Writing in chatroom is accepted, but the worst part is that participation is not given by attendance, but the quality and quantity of your sharing. <br /><br />If you want to score high in this section, you need to SPEAK, TWICE OR MORE each lecture.<br /><br />Bonus marks will be given if you ask questions or share your views on the debates of other groups.<br /><br />========================================<br />FYI, this is the score breakdown of this semester:<br /><br />Midterm: 44/50 (mean 38.03, low 32, high 50)<br />Final Exam: 49/50 (mean 42.27, low 0, high 50)<br />Debate (Performance): not disclosed<br />Debate (Peer Evaluation): 20/20<br />(remember to cooperate with your teammates)<br />Participation: not disclosed<br /><br />Grade: A+<br />(If you are an introvert like me too, don't give up.

You only need to revise the notes one day before and that's it.<br /><br />========================================<br />Debate (40%):<br /><br />The heaviest workload in this course. You need to prepare a 4-minute scripts, filled with examples and logical deductions, as well as ethics theories.<br /><br />Our group is assigned for the first debate. And the date arranged was also unfortunate - right during the midterm periods. <br /><br />My advice: find the best teammate.<br /><br />========================================<br />Participation (20%):<br /><br />If you are taking it in the spring semester, that means you are in Pathway 2. And essentially, it means fierce competitions. Your classmates are students from GBUS, DDP, ECOF, MAEC, QFIN, RMBI and etc. <br /><br />Everyone was just competing to speak and share during the class. Often you will see a whole page of students who are holding their hands and waiting to be called to speak. If you are shy like me, try not to be shy.

You would have to do a bit of prep before each lecture as there are case studies that will be covered in each lecture. This is very mild though, probably 30 minutes is sufficient each week. Make sure to do it though, as it is easy participation points if you are quick to answer some of the basic questions regarding the case.<br /><br />However, there are times this feels like a 4 credit course, especially close to the midterms and debates. The first midterm requires a comprehensive understanding of the theories so you will have to study quite a bit. The debate can be a nightmare if your mates aren't as committed to the course as you are (random grouping). Will require a dozen or more hours of prep and research if you want to succeed.<br /><br />Will update on midterm 2.",

However, you could choose your groupmates as everybody had the access to the topic excel sheet, in which we typed our names under the topic.<br />*For this semester, I found a pattern that students in the same topic will be separated into two teams by the order that the names were typed.<br />i.e. first 7 names typed were in one group and the rest 7 names were in another group.<br /><br />Then there were 2 mid-terms. Mid-term 1 is a closed-book MC exam including 25 MCQs and we had 60 mins to complete. And those questions can have multiple answers (Yes, you heard it right, MCs in MCs)<br />Mid-term 2 is a take-home essay, an argumentative essay with max. 1500 words. The essay structure is actually similar to the Opening part of the debate.",
            "comment_teaching": "JC is really good at teaching. To be honest, the content itself is not really interesting but JC makes it enjoyable to attend the lectures. When explaining those ethical concepts, he would give some real-life examples that students can relate to. You can easily understand what he is talking about as he does not speak in monotone. <br /><br />What makes his ethical lesson special is that he does teach us how to apply it in lifelike settings, so you can use them flexibly.<br /><br />We are given some ethical questions to discuss during the class most of the time. It does help us in understanding the concept as JC would push us to think further. However, it left just adequate time for JC to explain the concepts. Thus, you may need to study some theories in-depth outside of the classroom.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading Structure:<br />Mid-term 1: 15%<br />Mid-term 2: 25%<br />Debate: 30%<br />Participation: 20%<br />Pop Quizzes: 10%<br /><br />The participation points are not given based on attendance but how many times you contribute to the class discussions. Here are a few ways to earn points: raise your hands and speak when JC asks a discussion question, write your comments/thoughts about the debate topic/ content debated after a debate is finished. <br />Participation Cards are given out and you may earn 1 or 2 points for each contribution.<br /><br />Mid-term 1 itself is not so difficult but the grading mechanism is. Other than MCs in MCs, you cannot go back to the previous questions after you click NEXT. So be careful guys. For each question, only correct options are given partial marks i.e. you need to choose all correct options to earn the entire 1 mark, otherwise, you just get marks in decimal numbers. And here is the trouble part, you will lose the entire mark if you choose a wrong option (no matter how many correct options you chose). <br /><br />For the debate, you'll be assigned in a group of 6-7 (depending on class size). And you get to decide which role you gonna take within the group (Three roles: Opening, Rebuttal, and Closing). The schedule can be quite tight depending on which topic you choose, for example, Topic 1 Team debate first.<br />Some tips for getting higher marks in Debate.<br />- The first team may receive bonus points for debating first (as said to be a linear grading for Debate)<br />- Outstanding performance may bonus points. Not only winning the debate but also need to give a high-quality debate <br /><br />It was said that there might be up to 5 pop quizzes for the case materials but ended up 2 quizzes were given. The quizzes were quite easy, just make sure you read the case material carefully and in detail. They are closed-book quizzes (given out in Canvas) and JC really has close eyes on that.<br /><br />I eventually got an A, and feel I deserve it!!! I really put my effort and time into the course, especially the Debate.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload can be heavy. The debate could really take a chunk of time especially if there is a free-rider in the group :)<br />The preparation for pop quizzes and raising questions for debates can be time-consuming as well.

It involves the reading of the given materials. There is a tight time limit but if you use the search function wisely, very easy to find the answer. No need memorization.<br /><br />This debate is essentially a group project. If you win in the debate, you should receive slight more marks. All the groups have their marks varied between 16-19, so even if you lost the debate you got okish mark. As usual, getting a freerider and my debate score goes below mean.<br /><br />Mid-term 1 requires you to answer 7 short questions in given time.

Even though there are not much content in this Course, you have to study to get a high mark in this exam.<br /><br />Fourth, you have this debate project. Note that this project requires you to do both positive and negative side. Provided that your group has no freeriders and 6 people in total, each people have to do at least one section, sometimes the powerpoint. You also bear the pressure of getting low mark in peer evaluation. Yeah, I do not like these 2 systems. <br /><br />Lastly, you have Mid-term 2.

I guess I got lucky and tbh I enjoyed learning the course topics.<br /><br />Before the MT, I went through all the pre-recorded video (the one posted on canvas around 10 mins, not the class recording) and just revised from there.<br /><br />But I would say the grading is really competitive, as my friend who got 36/40 for MT and 17/20 for personal reflection got B+. Therefore, I think MT and personal reflection are the main sources of a high grade.",
            "comment_workload": "Participation is recorded, so we need to attend every class.<br /><br />There was a bi-weekly discussion that you need to answer. Most people answered it as if it is like an essay, but for me. I would say the discussion is a fun task because the prompt is quite interesting and you can basically talk it from your view, just bs all the way. lol<br /><br />The group project is fun because you get to watch something from Netflix and present it. My group did a role play and found it a fun project. Furthermore, the grouping was random, and I was lucky to get a very active group.<br /><br />The personal reflection was a 500-words essay answering the prompt. I would highly suggest to add more principles and explain it thoroughly to get a high mark.",

Attend all lectures and tutorials!!!<br /><br />Tip 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;2% will be deducted from your final total course score of 100% if no posting of weekly discussions are made. <br /><br />Tip 3: Follow the rubric carefully when crafting your presentation for the group project.

I don't get why this has to be done in a group. This could have been completed individually with minimal effort! Making it a group project actually increases the workload! <br /><br />Half of my group members were very competent and we completed the research and slide preparation two weeks before the presentation date. Workload for the group project was very light. This was achieved despite having 3 group members out of 6 being free-riders and contributed minimally.<br /><br />The weekly discussion did not require much effort. Simply write a response based on the discussion topics posted on canvas every week. I could finish it within half an hour and even respond to my friend's responses. <br /><br />We just had our integrated test today. We were required to write an essay response to a question posted on canvas. It was easy; simply read through all slides and reading materials a night before and you'll do fine.",

Plus, you would need to invest much time into the AESP project in the end where you have to form a group from 5-6 people and help out a small business in hong kong. <br /><br />Nonetheless, all of the work assigned from Mark is carefully designed and would definitely be useful to your learning and growth.",

Trust me, Mark can feel that, and he knows that who pays efforts in each class.

But there is no real benchmark of what's good until the day you get your grades which may be a real shock to some who didn't get the grade they were expecting. <br /><br />For reference, I posted every week on the online forum, talked at least once each class, had a pretty good project and we also had a really good presentation at the end. In which I got an A, but idk if this applies to all cases.",

Just read the readings before class every week (important!), post weekly on the online forum, put some effort into the group project, try to be active in class and lastly the integrated test which is just a short essay of about 1 hr. Not bad. Oh also don't forget to come to class every week and for all the 2 tutorial of your group.",

Unfortunately the MA speaker session was on the night before a midterm (that I think most of the class had), so the time wasn't very convenient.<br /><br />I know some people skipped classes, but I would recommend going to class. In lectures there are in-class exercises worth 10% (which is difficult make up for with online participation if you miss it), and you need to know what topics are covered in class to know what to write in your individual essay at the end (which is worth 15%). The reading material uploaded on canvas doesn't cover everything discussed in lectures, and some of it covers topics that weren't discussed in lectures, so you would need to attend lectures to know which topics were covered in class.",

She also tries to pick people that haven't contributed much to give everyone a fair chance.<br /><br />Maddy is a nice professor and tries her best to help students. She is very lenient. For the AESP project, she told us that in the event of unforeseen events (e.g. an NGO at the last minute no longer wants to co-operate with us), she would not penalise us for that, and would rather focus on how we overcame the challenge. Even after the deadline, she will encourage us to hand in assignments or finish surveys, but with a penalty of course (if you're late).<br /><br />In the beginning, I was a little worried about being in her class because I had no idea whether she would be a good professor as she is new to HKUST.

Madeline will try to pick people who haven't answered in class before so I think it's quite fair. There is also an online response form for you to share your thoughts if you weren't called upon in class. <br /><br />The Applied Ethics Social Project doesn't relate to the course content at all so I don't understand its purpose. Everyone is randomly assigned to groups of 5 and has to do some kind of service project with a recommended time of 8 hours of service per group member (group meetings don't count). Each group is marked based on how creative their service idea is and the impact they made on the community, however, based on what I know most groups faked their impact so the project is kind of pointless. <br /><br />Lastly, individual work includes 3 reflection surveys (multiple choice) and an essay reflecting on the course.",

You react to the topic others raised or what others had said. It will take some time if you try to stand out from all the discussions, as your paragraph has to be longer and more inspiring.

He basically copied and pasted one part of the practice paper to the integrated test, just with slightly different choices. Also remember the writing framework for analysing ethical issues (the framework appears in his notes quite frequently)<br /><br />Project is VERY important. My group screwed up group presentation, but luckily our reports were at least average. Make sure to take more photos for the &quot;verification&quot; part of the project.

AESP is not the key to getting a good grade. There is no evaluation session and the instructor would not acknowledge your contribution to the group.

Missing one lesson is almost equivalent to 2% of final score. Don't miss lectures and tutorials! Otherwise, it will be nearly impossible to achieve A range. In-class Participation does not really help as Mark would not remember your name unless you are making a really good answer. Students are generally very active in answering questions, therefore, it is very hard to distinguish yourself from the crowd through answering questions. However, participation in the Online Discussion Board is essential for getting even satisfactory grades. You should at least write a passage on the board per week.

Policymaking<br /><br />Week 12. Integrated Test<br /><br />The assignments are also very fun! Assignment 1 is a negotiation simulation with a random partner, and what you are graded on is the quality of your reflections. Assignment 2 is a policy simulation with your groupmates in your group project. You have to make tough decisions in order to prevent or delay a zombie outbreak from spreading in your fictional country.<br /><br />The final project is a 10-page negotiation teaching others some specific ethical concept. It is very fun if you have inspiration on what to write (my groupmates watch a lot of dramas, so they have so many thoughts. Me: confusion)",

Additionally you don't need to book appointments with him, you can just walk up to his office and have a chat about life!!!<br /><br />Furthermore, he proclaimed himself as a master procrastinator, and he understands the mindsets of students that procrastinate. As a result, he gives numerous extensions even for the simplest of reasons, and he rescheduled the integrated test for people who were sick during April/May.<br /><br />In the integrated test, he gives out free snacks and drinks to everyone!!!

I write a lot (too much that David added a warning in the extra pages saying &quot;you should probably stop writing&quot;). <br /><br />As the exam is closed book, the cutoff should be different to previous years (which were online and open book).<br /><br />I assume that I did good in the project and test. Finally I get A-range.",
            "comment_workload": "For a 2 credit course, the workload is more like 3 credit course. The official contact time is 2 hours per week. But, there is reading material every week which are tested in the reading quizzes or the integrated test.<br /><br />You also need to arrange times to meet with partner (for assignment 1) or groups (for assignment 2 and final project). Otherwise, the assignments are really easy to complete.<br /><br />The final project is due during the exam period, so I recommend to start early!!! You have to come up with a full simulation with plot, confidential information, outcomes, and teaching instructions. In 10 pages, my group wrote almost 4000 words!!!<br /><br />You also cannot 'properly' revise the integrated test as the long questions are always different. In fact, its better to try understand every concept by reading the reading materials and ppt. DO NOT JUST 'MEMORIZE'!<br /><br />Tip: As David teaches and marks 300 students, it is recommended that your responses are unique and different to your classmates. That way, he will be less bored and may give you better marks (especially in long questions).",

Grade heavily depends on Mark's impression on you.<br />Good groupmates will help a lot, be responsible and don't free-ride the project.<br />The grading policy is totally non-transparent, and students will not be able to know any of their scores in this course. <br />Attendance is very important in this course, they will deduct you score if you don't attend the class.<br />My grade: B+ (coz I was too shy to raise my hands in the beginning of the course, and forgot to bring reading materials for the open-book exam)",

But you can also discuss some of it with JC, he is friendly and helpful to the students who want to learn more knowledge in his lessons, I bet he will surprise you during the conversation.<br /><br />No recording, only live<br />miss one lesson and you will never gonna know what midterm mainpoints he will test. <br />(He likes to give some hints about the test/exam during the lecture)",

If you are late for his class, plz show a very very very polite attitude as much as you can, otherwise...<br />JC will become a devil roasting you for straight 5 mins in front of the whole class<br />Dont ask me why :)<br /><br />He is not that gd at teaching concepts as i guess he assumed you know some of the points already, so you may need to do some research yourself to make sure you really understand what he is talking about during the lecture.",

Topics include planned obsolesce, utilitarianism, corruption in the business world, ethical dilemmas like the famous trolley problem and others. Easy content. Personally found it a little boring. Those who want to learn a specific skill wouldn't like this course as there are basically no takeaways after attending lessons. Overall, it was an easy course for me with digestible content and a great grade.",

Overall Grade: A, even though I missed a couple of lectures.<br />But the grading is extremely non-transparent, all we get is the letter grade. No idea how I did in the test or the group project. This may cause some problems for those who got a grade they were dissatisfied with. But this wasn't the case for me.<br />For the integrated test, I intentionally included a part that was not on the ppt slides but was mentioned in class to show that I was actually listening. Would recommend doing this as I think the professor would notice it. Also, if you pay attention in lessons, I would say you only have to revise an hour the day before the test (skimming through all the readings and making some brief notes)",
            "comment_workload": "Very little workload. There are reading materials every week but you don't need to read them as Mark will go through them in the lectures. I actually didn't read any of them before lessons. There is also an easy group project where we had to choose a case related to business ethics and explain the controversy (7-10 min presentation by 2-3 members of the group) We also had a discussion board. Had to do it at least once a week but it takes very little time to finish (15mins per post for me). I ended up doing more than one post per week as I hoped it would help me get a better grade, not sure if that was what got me an A though.",

Then he goes on with his PPT slide about no cellphones in class.

Just raise your hand at every opportunity until he gets sick of seeing your hand. Also, aim to share at least 5 news articles that you've read outside of class.<br /><br />The AESP project contributes to 40% of your grade and thats basically what he looks at the most. It consists of a progress report (1-2 pages, he gives you the format), a presentation (not graded), and a final report. Our group did a half-hearted job on our progress report and scored 50% on it only because we used the wrong template and had to come up with something during class. Our presentation wasn't top notch either; however, it surely was better than the presentations of the other groups. The report was well written (partly because I was the one writing most of it).<br /><br />There usually is a test/ in class essay near the finals.
