If you use the textbook, you will have a good grasp of the concepts. And personally, I found them interesting because it introduces more depth into topics that I have not done before. BUT this is clearly a scam. Refer to Grading.",

Its just that the topics are not relevant to the course. Most of the lesson is spent on real world examples which just turn to a sermon on life lessons. He claims that the key to getting good grades on the exams is attending all the lectures, but I find that hard to believe. I attended all classes before mid-term and still got a shitty grade. So I stopped attending lectures after that because it was a waste of time and used that time for other courses, or just for studying the content from the textbook.",
            "comment_grading": "Pretty harsh I would say. Its just that, even if you have a good understanding of what is given in the textbook, and you do well in the weekly problem sets, you will BOMB the exams. Wing sets really tough exam papers that evoke laughter and tears. Laughter because it seems like a joke because the type of questions he sets have seemingly NO connection to what the course actually covers, and tears because you know you're dead.",

This deliberate repetition served as a helpful refresher, allowing students to consolidate their understanding and bridge any knowledge gaps. As the class progressed, the level of difficulty was gradually increased, providing a gradual and seamless transition from familiar concepts to more complex ones. This incremental approach to content delivery enabled students to build upon their existing knowledge and tackle more challenging topics with confidence. Overall, the combination of an engaging teaching style, thoughtful review sessions, and a gradual increase in difficulty contributed to an enriching and rewarding learning experience in the economics class.",

Although the concepts and formulas can seem challenging at first glance, when contextualized and slowly explained with examples, it is really interesting and opens lots of new perspectives on using mathematics for solving economics problems. The tutorials are also helpful for reminding us about the basic maths concepts, so don't worry even if you're rusty. I recommend this course even if you don't major in economics, if you're from the business faculty or IPO.",

There are people that get full marks on midterms, so it's not too difficult if you pay attention to lectures and review. There is very low variance in in-class performance so it really depends on midterms to draw the skill level bell curve, but its not hard",

It is basically an advanced level of Econ 2113 or 2103. Compared to other business courses, it requires quite a lot of math, typically differentiation. But the professor loves to use intuition to better explain the concepts after using math, so don't be too worried if you are suck at calculation.<br /><br />In the mid-term and final, you will not encounter many math problems. However, the crux is still the intuitions and the logic behind the concepts, so make sure you know and digest all the contents well before the exams, and you will not get a bad grade for sure!",

He loves to share his own<br />experience during classes (e.g. dating experience), which makes the interaction of the class vivid. He is patient in answering questions as well, be it in class or via email. I would say he is the BEST professor that I have faced in university!<br /><br />But one thing you should be careful about, especially during online lessons/exams. He only gave us 3 minutes to scan our answers during mid-term, when everyone had around 10 pages to scan.
