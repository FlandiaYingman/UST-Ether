            "comment_teaching": "Frankly speaking, the teaching is good though the professor has some accent in English which takes me some time to get used to it.<br /><br />I have read some posts evaluating Prof. LING in USTSPACE, some of which thought the teaching is not so good. I would say if you take every class on time, then the teaching quality is quite good. The reason is that many proves or details are given in the form of hand-wrriten notes during class. So, if you miss the class, you will know nothing since the notes is not easy to read without explanation.",

So I don't think the grade is given by curve.<br /><br />20% individual project<br />15% homework<br />15% midterm<br />50% final<br /><br />I think if you work hard in this course, you will definitely get a good grade. I got A+ at the end.",
