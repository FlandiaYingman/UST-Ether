        "description": "This course for business students teaches a specific method for obtaining valid and reliable information on how and, more importantly, why consumers behave the way they do. The method taught in this course allows drawing causal inferences about the behavior of consumers, thus conferring managers the power to make informed predictions about how consumers will respond to marketing stimuli, positively impacting the development of marketing strategies and marketing mix decisions. Managers mastering this tool will be able to develop better products and services and promote them more effectively. Additionally, in this course students will gain advanced-level insights concerning consumer behavior, particularly about factors that make consumers act “irrationally”. The course is directed at students preparing for brand/product management, business development, or consulting positions.",
