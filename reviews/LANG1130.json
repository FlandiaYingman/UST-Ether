The 9 units are taught in the following sequence:<br /><br />Unit 1: Nice to meet you <br />Unit 2: Do you speak Cantonese?<br />Unit 6: Have you eaten yet?<br />Unit 3: When will you...<br />Unit 5: Where are you going?<br />Unit 7: Let's go Yum Cha<br />Unit 8: What is your favourite pass time?<br />Unit 9: See what I have bought...<br />Unit 4: Hello, can I speak to...",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor teaches the content very well and ensures that everyone speaks and practices the dialogues and vocabulary. The professor frequently engages the class with breakout room activities where we have to come up with our answers to certain questions and report our preferences to the class. It's great that everyone has to turn on their camera because it fosters greater interaction and a more engaging classroom environment. Ultimately the class is fun because even though classes are currently on zoom and thus can lead to zoom fatigue, the classes feel energising.",

            "comment_workload": "The overall workload is light. There are usually 2 assignments every week. A listening task and a speaking task. They don't take very long and are fun to do. Every so often there is a bigger assessment such as recording a video of yourself talking about your daily routine (Assessment 1) or content related to the 9 units (Part of Assessment 3). Assessment 2 is a 1000 word Project Report written in English on an aspect of Hong Kong culture. Assessment 3 consists of a 1-1 conversation with the professor, a role play and a 1.5 minute video recording discussing your project research and related to the 9 units. Finally, as the professor engages the class and offers ample opportunities for participation. This part of the grading scheme is the simplest to obtain. Just come to class ready to practice your Cantonese!",
