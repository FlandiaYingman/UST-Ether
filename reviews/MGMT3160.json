        "description": "This course covers strategic opportunities arising from environmental risks. Public and regulatory demand for environmental products and services must co-exist with the need for corporations to maximize shareholder wealth. The course examines both theoretical and practical issues that arise in attempting to balance the health of the natural environment with value creation. Is there an inherent conflict between the institutions of business and our ability to care for the environment? What competitive opportunities are created for firms and what do they have to do to seize these opportunities? Lessons from the course will be interest to the students of strategy and the environment. Restricted to MGMT and BBA students.",

You just need to work on two in pairs, apply the cocnepts and answer the issues in the case, and submit before class. It is preferred to do one before midterm and after midterm, not wait until the end, as the preceding cases are easier to work on.<br /><br />For midterm and final, they are both open book. For midterm, there are several long questions on course materials and one case analysis. For final, content is cumulative excepts readings before midterm. There is no question, rather like the case writeup format.",
