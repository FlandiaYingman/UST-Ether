            "comment_content": "One important thing to mention in the beginning is that among EE degrees offered by most of the institutions around the world, electromagnetics is one of the most important major requirements (analogous to COMP3711 for CS students). Among the EE degrees of local institutions in Hong Kong, EE offered by UST is the only degree that does not require students to complete electromagnetics. (HKU, CUHK, CityU, PolyU all require their EE students to take electromagnetics. ) <br /><br />Therefore, TAKE THIS COURSE if you want to do an EE master or PhD. It is possible that some PG schools will reject you RIGHT AWAY as soon as they figure out you have not taken this course or ELEC3400. If you want to do IC design (digital or analog), microelectronics or optics and photonics stream, this is even MORE likely to happen. <br /><br />Tentative list of topics for 13 weeks:<br />1. Introduction, Vector algebra, Coordinate systems and transformations<br />2. Vector calculus, Gradient, Divergence and Curl operators, Divergence’s and Stokes’ theorems, Vector fields<br />3. Electrostatic Fields, Coulomb’s Law, Gauss’ Law, Electric Potential, Electrostatic Energy<br />4. Electric Field in Material Space, Conductors and Dielectrics, Continuity Equation, Boundary Conditions<br />5. Resistance and Capacitance, Poisson’s and Laplace’s Equations, Electrostatic Boundary Value Problem (optional)<br />6. Magnetostatic Fields, Biot-Savart’s law, Ampere’s Law, Magnetic Vector Potential, Magnetic Forces, Magnetic Dipoles, Magnetization, Magnetic Energy, Magnetic Materials<br />7. Maxwell’s Equations, Displacement Current, Time-Harmonic Fields<br />8. Electromagnetic Wave Propagation, Plane Waves, Poynting Vector, Reflection of plane waves at normal incidence, Standing waves, Light wave propagation<br />9. Transmission Lines, Parameters and Equations, Input Impedance, Standing-wave ratio, Power<br /><br />Actually this course only covers 1-8 due to the limit of the length of one semester.<br />Calculus IS THE KEY. The most difficult part is not solving the integrals, the most difficult part is how to come up with the BEST INTEGRAL in the BEST COORDINATES.",

You don't need to worry that you cannot grasp the course material at all since the professor is very nice who would go over the same part of the lecture again if he finds us having difficult understanding.

Strictly speaking, it should be classified as the combination of the studies in the field of phys and elec. <br /><br />Starting from the fundamental concepts such as vector algebra and three types of coordinate systems (cartesian, cyclindrical and spherical) required for subsequential calculations, this course cover in-depth topics including the introduction of electric and magnetic field (Divergence Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, Gauss's Law, Ampere's Circuital Law), the scope of material on E &amp; M field phenomena (Continuity Equation, Relaxation Time, E/M Dipole moment, etc), and eventually, the four complete Maxwell equations expressing in terms of time and space (i.e. -iwt &amp; kr, plane wave propagation, Power E x H, complex intrinsic impedence, loss angle, etc). <br /><br />* As light is a form of EM waves, it is recommened to have solid understanding of the skills covered in this course before your journey into the studies of optics. For an example, they are important when performing calculations related to light diffraction and interference<br /><br /><br />If you have a strong interest on the topics, it is crucial to have an effective time management. It is not recommened to take the course alongside with other high workload courses, as it requires your effort to complete assignments and review of the lecture material.",

Yet, Prof. Poon is kind of an export that could clearly explain all the concepts covered in the course. Sometimes, he also teaches some additional contents, like the way of how to derive an equation, to reinforce our understanding to particular concepts. Therefore, it is always recommend to attend all his lectures, and you can learn effectively and achieve more.",

It is simple if you have attended the lectures, otherwise it is still managable but time-wasting to finish them. <br /><br />It is appreciated that Prof. Poon have prepared a plenty of practice examples and tutorial notes by the end of each topic.

            "comment_content": "It's more like a PHYS course than ELEC course. Please do not use 'engineering' way anymore to study this course, think as a physics student and take notes like physics student will help you to handle it.<br /><br />This area course introduces applied electromagnetics from fundamentals to applications. Topics include: Gauss', Faraday's and Ampere's laws; electrostatics and magnetostatics; Maxwell's equations; electromagnetic plane wave propagation; transmission lines; radiation and antenna fundamentals; light wave fundamentals. Students will also acquire hands-on experience to electromagnetics through laboratory sessions.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is the nicest guy I ever seen in HKUST. He remember everyone's name and quiz/homework scores, he really cares everyone and gives warm encouragement. If there is A+ range, I'll choose A+ range for this section.<br /><br />His teaching is in clear logic and won't make you feel boring during lectures.<br /><br />Everybody knows some professors even don't know what they are teaching about in this university, they can not even provide an answer. to your question. But Professor POON answers any question clearly and patiently.<br /><br />This professor is really an expert.You may also find opportunities to do research with him if you are interested about photonics.",
            "comment_grading": "Grade haven't released yet.I believe it's fair. I'll put a A here and update it later.<br />40% HW<br />20% Quizzes<br />10% Labs<br />40% Final exam<br /><br />Although you know your own scores, he won't release mean and SD on Canvas. Maybe the professor want you focus on content itself instead of 'grading'.<br />To see your final exam scores, you may reach him in person in his office. <br />Is that a new trend among ECE professors? My instructor from other course to the same thing. Maybe they want to take care of students more in person.",
            "comment_workload": "I have to give the workload a C,for following three reasons<br />1.In total 7 homework, each contains 10-11 questions requires you do that really carefully. The period between release date and end date is just one week.<br />2.The quizzes. Despite finishing 7 hw, you have to prepare quizzes in between, which is quite stressful<br />3.The lecture contents are too much and difficult for engineer students. Nobody can really understand it even to 90%.",
