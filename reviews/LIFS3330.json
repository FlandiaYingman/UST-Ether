It is suggested to take a look at the worksheet before you do the lab so that you can write down some answers on the worksheet at that moment. <br />This part is pretty easy and normal for a lab course and Google can help you as well.<br /><br />There are also two presentations about 1. the field trip and 2. a marine issue. The time of presentation is short so that the preparation can be easy.<br /><br />The final examination is not difficult but it is necessary to revise the material well especially the worksheet of correct answer, so ask TA for the answer if you get something wrong. The time of examination is at late November. <br /><br />This course did not require a full long report so the workload&nbsp;&nbsp;is not that great i will say.",
