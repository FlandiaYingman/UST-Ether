There is an essay about a topic Joseph chooses in the middle of the semester which you can easily get done in a day or two.

Joseph speaks pretty fast but also very clear, you are also welcome to ask at any time, so you don't have to worry about if it is too fast for you.<br />The good thing is, every class Joseph will invite a speaker ,who is so what related to the topic he taught in that class, to give a speech about the topic. That makes the whole learning experience more interesting and deeper because the speaker always give us some insight related to the topic or industry.",
            "comment_grading": "I got an A- for the course without doing anything special.<br />In the beginning of the semester, Joseph said we have to be active in the class(~50% class participation wtfff) and hand in homework on time so to get a decent grade. And the final presentation is also important. But for me, I rarely speak in class and was not the best in presentation. The only thing I think I was doing great is that I show my passion toward startup and asking tons of questions about my final presentation project when I have the chance to have a face-to-face mentoring with him.",
            "comment_workload": "Almost 0 workload lol.<br />You are required to hand in a pre-class preparation that you need to write down the questions you want to ask in the next class.<br />The only big thing is the final presentation and business proposal. They do take a while to finish.",
