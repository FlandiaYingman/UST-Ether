The Professor usually read the powerpoint and add some of his own opinion. I must say that I haven't serious hear about any lecture because the ppt shows all points in detail. During the class, IPRS and tutorial questions will be presented. The IPRS question is pretty easy while the tutorial questions are sometimes hard to tackle. However, the answers can be found by looking through the ppt.",
