            "title": "Stress and Strain (Literally)",
            "comment_content": "Despite increased difficulty, MECH2040 is still an extension of MECH2020 that took account on deformation based on the mechanics you've studied in your last semester:<br /><br />1. Concept of Stress<br />2. Stress and Strain under Axial Loading<br />3. Torsion<br />4. Pure bending<br />5. Transverse loading<br />-------Midterm-------<br />6. Transformation of Stress/Mohr Circle<br />7. Design of Beams for Strength<br />8. Deflection of Beams by Integration<br />9. Columns and Buckling<br />10. Energy Method<br /><br />All of them are fresh topics distinct from MECH2020 or your high school Physics concept, so skipping lectures is certainly a bad idea. Concepts and skills from MECH2020 are expected to be applied, especially methods of finding internal forces and truss analysis.<br /><br />In addition, the course instructors gave us a lot of extra contents that are not taught in lectures. All of these contents should be fairly useful in your future engineering studying and experience.<br /><br />One should take notice that the course is calculation extensive, so purchasing the textbook will help you in tackling assignment questions a lot, and prepares you for exams better.",
            "comment_teaching": "In general, Professor Ye did give us a clear learning experience. As the course is calculation extensive, a number of course contents are written and explained on her screen/digital whiteboard. Her notes are mainly for reference and showing examples.<br /><br />When compared to MECH2020's Professor Robin Ma, you will notice that Professor Ye's teaching included much less examples. As a result, those who're accustomed to the teaching style of Robin Ma (including me) may feel strange in her lectures. That said, as demonstrations of experiments were expected to be conducted in face-to-face lectures, such difference seems reasonable.<br /><br />As for the TAs, Li Mengmeng's tutorial sessions are rather &quot;hea&quot;. She typically only gives us 2 to 3 minutes to think about each tutorial questions, then releases the answers to us summarily. As a result her tutorials generally only last for some 30 minutes. On the other hand, both Guo Zixiao and Li Kangjie performed better in tutorial classes, with sufficient time for students to try on each questions and detailed explanation.",
            "comment_grading": "Assignments (x10): 20% (Mean generally over 80%)<br />Midterm: 35% (MC: 32/44, LQ: 23/56; mean 29.46/44 and 23.45/56)<br />Final: 45% (Never released, but should be sufficiently good)<br /><br />I'm not sure whether how other students finished their assignments, but the means for assignments are ridiculously high, generally over some 80%, and occasionally rising over 90%. Among all assignments, only 2 of my assignments attained full mark, and the rest of them are below the mean.<br /><br />On the other hand, the exam questions aren't really hard if you can solve them one by one with calmness and confidence. While the midterm long questions looks confusing (like, what is the angular deflection of a complicated object fixed to a wall), the solution is really straightforward: that's what I found out when they released the midterm's solution.<br /><br />At the end I get a surprised A- for the course, which seems that the questions I done during the study break aren't vain.",
            "comment_workload": "An assignment was released per chapter, and we had 1 week to finish each assignment (except the one given during the midterm week). Assignment questions were taken from the textbooks, and typically went much deeper than the examples shown in classes. When combined with the workload of other classes, such arrangement is rather tight for us.<br /><br />This highlights the importance of buying a course textbook for further understanding, as you can check your answers or do similar questions if you don't understand some of the concepts.<br /><br />Regarding the exams, doing a lot of textbook questions and past papers can significantly help with your results. Professor Ye did provide us with last year's midterm and final, though more is better. Concepts are also important. One of the final question asked you to explain whether a beam will buckle under a sufficiently big tensile/compressive force. If you didn't go through the concept, you'll miss these easy marks.",
