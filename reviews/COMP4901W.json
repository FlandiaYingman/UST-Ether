        "description": "This course provides a holistic introduction to the world of Blockchain Protocols and Smart Contracts. You will learn how cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum work, why they are secure, and how you can use them to develop smart contracts. You will also learn to detect and avoid common security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. This is a very hands-on course with lots of extra-credit homeworks and mini-projects and no final exam. The course covers the following topics: basics of cryptography, the double-spending problem in decentralized currencies, Proof-of-work and its alternatives, programmable blockchains and smart contracts, auctions and escrows, common smart contract vulnerabilities, and tools for verifying the correctness of a smart contract.",

            "comment_workload": "Ustspace has a weird definition on workload. A is very light, B is light, C is average.<br /><br />Reasonable workload. Since there is no midterm or final, the assignments and the project are relatively more challenging. The marking is forgiving such that you can resubmit once for each assignment (not project) after receiving feedback. Students are required to finish the project on their own without any discussion with peers. That's why it requires weeks to complete the project.<br /><br />As announced by the professor, a few students had been caught plagiarism in the assignments. This fact is a huge deterrent to cheating in this course.",

It is a This is an EVEN MORE OUTRAGEOUS AND EXAGGERATED DISASTER then COMP3021!!!<br /><br />There is no midterm and final exam. Instead, there are 7 assignments and 1 final project. Each assignment carries 10% of your total grade and the final project worths 30%. For each of the assignment, every student got a chance of resubmit if they did not obtain full mark. Apart from this, you can obtain a 15% bonus for assignments and 10% for the final project. <br /><br />It is hard to tell the actual mean scores for the assignment part as everyone could resubmit. But obviously, it would be very close to 100%. The mean score for the final project is 27.9/30.<br /><br />My scores:<br />Assignments 70/70 + 4 bonus.<br />Final Project 25/30 + 5 bonus.<br />Overall: 100/100<br /><br />I thought I would definitely get a A+ for this course. But guess what, the department changed the grading scheme at the final moment. The full mark for this course is updated into 125, and grades will be distributed by a standard way of &quot;拉curve&quot;. So my marks become 104/125.<br /><br />This is much more ironic than the situation in COMP3021. I don't know why there's no one even discuss about it, as there are 125 students in this coures, even more than COMP3021.",

            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is decent and normal. Nothing special, and nothing bad.<br />The Prof. is knowledgeable in the field, and since it is the first offering I feel like the presentation is slightly unprepared.",
            "comment_grading": "I got 111% over 125%, A-<br />Cut-off: A+: 120%, A: 115%<br />Wltf?<br />Yeah &quot;Bonus&quot; marks, but you must do it anyway.<br /><br />Update on 27/06/2022: After I (and many others) emailed CSE Department Heads about this, they decided to change the grading scheme back to &quot;normal&quot;<br />I get A+ now<br />If they offer this course again, expect the grading to be significantly different and you may get B with high score as to balance out the total distribution of A.",
            "comment_workload": "7 homework, each takes a few hours or up to a day.<br />1 project, a few days of work, some google and thinking. <br />You can resubmit once for better grade.<br />Adequate time to finish the assignments/project.",
