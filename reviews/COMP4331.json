        "description": "This course will provide an introduction to concepts and techniques in the field of data mining. Materials include an introduction to data warehousing and OLAP, data preprocessing and the techniques used to explore the large quantities of data for the discovery of predictive models and knowledge. The course will include techniques such as nearest neighbor, decision tress, neural networks, Bayesian networks and Naive Bayes, rule-based methods, association analysis and clustering, as well as social networks and data mining applications in business and finance applications, and other emerging data mining subareas. Students learn the materials by attending lectures and implementing and applying different data analysis and mining techniques to large datasets throughout the semester.",

When it comes to the assignments and the project, we all end up in learning all by ourselves.<br /><br />I sincerely wish that we were taught how to import, manipulate, and visualize data using the NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn packages. Knowing how to do data mining by hand doesn't help sh!t at all.",
            "comment_teaching": "At first Prof CHEN's teaching seemed not bad at all. But I later discovered that he had a notorious habit of just skimming through all these algorithms and casually skipping a lot of the details, and he expected all of us to understand all of them as if we were all genii? I knew there were a lot of genii in the class, but I was deffo not one of them. Thus I instead learned by going over YouTube videos on data mining, and I found this 100x more effective than attending his lectures.<br /><br />Okay. Just another self-learning course.",
            "comment_grading": "Not bad. The TAs have been quite lenient in marking our assignments and projects. But as most of us score high in the assignments and the projects, exams become the determining factor of our grade.<br /><br />✏️ Midterm<br />Mean = 37/60<br /><br />✏️ Final<br />Mean = 75/100, SD = 15<br /><br />I got 36/60 in the midterm, 78/100 in the final, 98/100 in the project and averaged around 90 in the 3 assignments. Overall I got around 82.7% and this translated into a B+.<br /><br />As a tip, don't be in despair when your codes do not run. I encountered quite a few times the situation when the codes in my assignments and project did not run at all, but I still managed to secure 90-ish by outlining the logic in my comments, explaining how I approached the problem, writing some partial codes, and most importantly, submitting PUNCTUALLY. Don't submit late even if you cannot finish the assignments. You might be surprised at how many marks you've secured by submitting partial codes with some explanation in the code and the report. Another thing is that if you've used Python packages outside of those suggested by the TAs (which is totally fine), there is no way the TAs could verify whether your codes could actually run or not.",
            "comment_workload": "Extremely heavy workload. Prof Chen seems to have very high expectation on us.<br /><br />💻 20% Assignments<br />💻 30% Project<br />✏️ 20% Midterm<br />✏️ 30% Final<br /><br />There are a total of 3 assignments in Python. All of them require the use of Anaconda, a distribution of Python designed for the purpose of data mining. The assignments are deffo not easy and we are required to spend some time to self-explore what the heck the tasks are and how to use the scikit-learn packages. Again, it's about the ability to self-learn.<br /><br />And then the fucking project! It was my worst nightmare ever. The project was a dropout prediction task extracted from the professional KDD-cup competition. We were allowed to form groups of up to 3 groupmates, but even with 3 people we still ate sh!t in the project. The project required us to do the data preprocessing (which spent us about 80% of our time) including loading and manipulating the data into a data structure we needed, feature engineering with discretization, data aggregation and transformation, selecting 3 classifiers for prediction, applying cross-validation for these classifiers, ensembling the classifiers and evaluating the classifiers with confusion matrices. This is the most demanding project I've ever met and you can imagine all my groupmate staying in front of our PCs days and nights coding and debugging and coding and debugging... An excellent opportunity to get hands-on experience of how it feels in the hell.<br /><br />As for the exams they're basically concept-based written papers covering various algorithms taught in class. No codes. Just data mining by hands, with a definitely insufficient amount of time. They were among the sh!ttiest papers ever as they differentiated us based on our speed instead of our understanding of the concepts.",

Good introductory course if you are curious in big data (how come diapers and beers are often bought together on a supermarket?) or looking to be a data scientist like me.<br />Assignments cover both written and programming (1st assignment in c++ while 2nd one in java or c++). Then midterm and final as usual.<br />The course was more on understanding the concepts than mathematics which I was expecting. You would find more questions using mathematics on the assignments while the exams would have more conceptual questions (like predicting how the result would look like given this input and this technique then explaining why).",

The lecture desktop does not allow it to run.<br />One time he was demoing a concept by googling his name. Somehow he stumbled to a website containing reviews about his teachings. He was surprised and spent a minute reading the review in front of the class. That was the best lecture session of this course in my opinion.",

Usually not taking too much time compared to other COMP4xxx courses.<br />If your programming skills aren't that good or you just don't like programming, it might take more time for you to do the programming assignment. Usually you need to implement one of the machine learning techniques (the easy ones). You should also make some documentation about the program (comments on code, how to run, etc.).",

At the same time, there is no skeleton code for all the assignments and project, which means that you have to start from the very beginning.

            "comment_content": "整個course無乜嘢背，主要係明白steps/algorithms。由於這個course比較簡單，上堂明到就得，不需花太多時間溫習。（其實是沒有什麼好溫習，因為沒有past paper或practice exercise。）",
            "comment_teaching": "prof. james kwok:<br />他教得很慢，但教得很清晰。他上堂喜歡 interact with students，他亦喜歡用生活例子做類比，所以都容易明，上他堂都不會太悶。<br />________________________________________<br /><br />TA: Mr. Zheng, Yimin + Mr. Jiang, Weisen + Mr. Yu, Runsheng<br />他們好helpful，覆email多數都好快！<br />改assignment方面，每個mistakes扣2分，所以個個都至少90幾分。",
            "comment_grading": "*************************<br />Here may be biased.<br />I admit that I do not have enough statistics to judge whether it is really a good grade semester. If you have more information, feel free to comment below.<br />*************************<br /><br />Statistics:<br />No statistics are officially released. Statistics can be seen in canvas in the beginning. It was disabled later. (i.e., we can't see the statistics.)<br />I remember the mean of the first 2 assignments are both higher than 99% (and no one gets below 94%), and the mean of the midterm is higher than 96%.<br />________________________________________<br /><br />考final exam前，估計mean54/55（請看上面statistics），咁即係 final 一試定生死啦！同埋我都有睇 prof.郭天佑 以前的 review (including https://ust.space/review/COMP4211) ，加上見d人咁勁，真心超驚爛grade。 <br />考緊final exam心諗，慘啦，好多題目都唔係好肯定，會唔會below mean㗎。結果⋯超好彩，估唔到自己攞到這個分數。<br />我當時諗，應該有A range啦，結果⋯一收到grade，完全喜出望外。<br />________________________________________<br /><br />For me:<br />Assignment(30%) 298/300<br />Midterm(25%) 100/100<br />Final Exam(45%) 95.5/100<br /><br />overall = 97.775%<br />grade = A+",
            "comment_workload": "COMP courses而言好輕。得3份assignment（絕對唔係COMP2011/2012 programming assignment的難度/長度），prof 話expect我們4-5小時搞掂1份assignment，我無計過，不過感覺合理。<br />Assignment主要參考吓tutorial的 python code，如果你熟python，可能會更快完成assignment。（小弟係唔識python嘅！)",
