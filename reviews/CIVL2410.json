You may think: &quot;That's even more than LANG&quot;, but then you'll quickly find out that it isn't even enough after reading different EIA reports (a trick is to convert bullet points into tables since tables do not count towards the word count).

In this part, you will have to work with your sub-groupmates to finish 1 section of an EIA report about a modified real construction case. Weekly groupwork was assigned.

To expose students to real world problems affecting water, air and land resources.<br /><br />3.

They are in the form of multiple choice questions that are to be answered using<br />the Personal Response System (PRS). The answers are automatically graded by the system and feedback is<br />instantaneous. When answering the questions, students may discuss with neighbors. The exercises account for<br />8% of the final grade, and will be based on 45% of the best of all the exercises.<br /><br />Personal Response System (PRS)<br />Using PRS, students are to answer questions posed in class using dedicated handsets or the PRS app via a<br />smartphone.",
