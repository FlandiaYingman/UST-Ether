            "comment_content": "This is an introductory course in one-variable calculus, the first in the Calculus I and II sequence, designed for students that have not taken HKDSE Mathematics Extended Module M1 or M2. Topics include functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives and rules of differentiation, applications of derivatives, and basic integral calculus.<br /><br />Yes, correct, but it is not just basic in my opinion. As a student that never have been tapped in calculus, it is already very hard and advanced. (Moreover, I am weak at maths. :( )<br /><br />It is fairly acceptable before midterm, which only included some basic differentiation and trigonometric identities, (but double angle formulas are as hard as hell for me.) But once you reach the final exam, it is another stuff. The preparation for the final exam took me at least 2 whole weeks to handle well with integration by doing the exercises given by tutorial. And when I tried to do the final exam past paper, I have no idea on how to do the first long question at all! The final exam past paper given is just ridiculously hard and not able to do the long question section. Although the final exam is an open-notes, full multiple-choice question paper due to the epidemic and the difficulty is decreased, it is still challenging for a newcomer to calculus.<br /><br />The lectures teach you basic theory on calculus with simple examples. While the tutorials give you more moderate exercises. So that you can earn some confidences from them. When the exams arrive, they give you questions with 100% different from what you have done before, so that you have no idea on how to solve them, crash your confidences that you have built before, and your grade is broken.",
            "comment_teaching": "Mr Lam is good at teaching and I am fortunate to be taught by him. It is easy to understand the theory with his explanations.&nbsp;&nbsp;He will solve some webwork questions in class and it is nice. The only problem is the questions taught in class are too easy compared to exam level. And you will find a hard time if you are studying for final exam with just his notes.<br /><br />Mr Chan's tutorial notes are useful and help me to overcome a lot of basic problems compared to other tutors notes that I have done. Still, the question types are not rich enough on dealing with the exams.<br /><br />My pals keep complaining about Avery's teaching to me, but I haven't been taught by him, so it is not good for me to comment. Maybe you can try his teaching yourself(or watching other comments are already enough). :)<br /><br />It is good to point out that I only attended for the first 3 tutorials, then I had skipped all of them, as I feel like the difference is not big if you have finished all the exercises in notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I attended the first 7 lectures because I feel okay and not waste my time. But for the remaining 13 lectures(not included with 7 video lectures after November), I think I have things more meaningful(like playing and studying mahjong) rather than attending them.<br /><br />TL:DR, don't waste time on things you don't interest in and can't improve your result significantly. JUST SKIPPED THEM ALL ARE STILL FINE FOR YOUR EXAM(as you still don't do well on the exam).",
            "comment_grading": "if you are good at maths, the course is fine for you. I believe getting A is not that hard for geniuses. Even so, paying more efforts to ensure you to get high enough marks.<br /><br />If you are bad at maths like me(DSE math level 3~4), you better to be prepared to get C or B- even you did tons of exercises included sources from the internet, you just don't have enough talent to overcome the problem sometimes.<br /><br />Find some pals that you can work with and good at maths would help you a lot, start studying at least before 2 weeks the exam, and struggle with those who are not good at so you feel less painful when you don't know how to do the maths. B range can be reached if you are determined, but don't think of A, it is just fate if you can't get the thing you hope for.<br /><br />my score:<br />Midterm:35/50 (mean: 25.45)<br />Final: 12/15 (mean: 7.8)<br />webwork:100% done with 100% mark<br />I believe I get a B grade. Nevertheless, the grading of this course is shit.<br />(update: B+ turns out,no A- so sad)<br /><br />weighing methods:<br />Method 1:15%(webwork) + 30%(midterm) + 55%(final)<br />Method 2:15%(webwork) + 85%(final)",
            "comment_workload": "9 hard webworks<br />1 challenging and losing-confidence midterm<br />1 super hard, non-human to do (except this seminar) final exam<br />That's it.<br /><br />Not many works to do, except working, studying, revising for final exam two whole weeks without playing any games(including mahjong!!).<br /><br />Webworks should be finished all and get full marks as you have unlimited attempts, otherwise you will have a hard time on the exams(the question type are some kind of similar and worth to do).<br />But I think it's fine for those who did well at maths, as they have a clear mind on how to answer them so they do not need to do a lot of works to enhance themselves, I believe. (No offense)<br /><br />The past paper of 2015 final exam is attached for reference. I think it is extremely hard on long-question section. You can try to do it and decided whether you shall work more or less for better grading.",

There will not be people like DickHui or Koopa Koo to help you with your Math. If you rely on the lectures/tutors alone, you will die. <br /><br />=Contents= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Covers topics from absolute value, to limits, to differentiation and ending with integration by substitution. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the contents are overlapped by HKDSE M2. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the contents covered in this course, like L'Hopital's Rule and limit to infinity, are direct prerequisite to MATH1014 (Which, if you haven't already realized, is what you will have to take next semester).

They will provide you with a good understanding of the concept allow you to deal with the difference types of problem. You can also check out Organic Chemistry Tutor or Khan's Academy's videos, although they tend to be on the easier side. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Work of warning: Integration is very difficult to understand so prepare AT LEAST 1 month before the exam if you are seeking an A range. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't really recommend reading the textbook as the style of writing is boring and technical. You will get confused and lost easily (Although the textbook proves to be pretty useful in 1014)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing exercises is a must. You can start off by doing Walter Chan's exercise (Or those provided by the other tutors). You can also go do those in 中大出版社's M2 textbook IF YOU HAVE TIME. Try to not spend too much time on one specific topic. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, go find Walter Chan for help if you have any question. <br /><br />-Saber Athena",

            "comment_content": "Personally, I studied Maths SL in IB. Most of the students in the course studied DSE and may have had a different experience than I had.<br /><br />The content up to the midterms consisted of limits and basic knowledge on derivatives. The difficulty was okay. All content on derivatives was covered in IB, and I had to learn about limits, mostly through Khan Academy, practicing past papers, and asking my peers.<br /><br />Finals suddenly got a lot more difficult and required studying to catch up, especially with the pace of how frequently Webworks were released. This is also where the part on word problems are introduced, and personally, in my opinion, those types of questions just required a degree of creativity to answer.<br /><br />Warning: This course will truly foster your HATRED for maths in the future. The effort required for most people is disproportionate to the outcome of this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Avery tries to be funny in his class, but he ends up acting silly. Despite his jolly personality during class, do not be deceived by how sadistic he is for the midterm and final exam of this course. People complain about his English and some may complain about his heavy accent, but given that this is a math course, I believe that his message is usually clear. His e-mails are written like a kindergartener though, but they inspire fear in you when you receive it as he often includes the mean and SD of the relevant assessment in the e-mail.<br /><br />Lectures are generally useless and skippable. There is a decent chance that you may doze off or fall asleep. Watching Khan Academy or videos from similar people would be more helpful in understanding contents of the course. Practicing solving and doing homework has actually taught me more than attending class as well.<br /><br />I didn't utilise the help of the T.A., Walter, but he seems to be friendly in tutorials. I also did not ask for help from the Math Support Centre because consulting them through an online environment would've been unnecessarily difficult, so I cannot comment on my experiences with the two parties.",
            "comment_grading": "For this semester, the course has two grading schemes:<br />Scheme 1 - 15% Webwork, 30% midterm, 55% finals; or<br />Scheme 2 - 15% Webwork, 85% finals<br /><br />Avery then chooses the higher grade produced by the two schemes. I'm not sure if the course used absolute grading like its sibling course, MATH 1013, but since the SD and mean of the midterm and final grades were given, it was probably curved.<br /><br />Now, for the gravely unjust grading system:<br />15% Webwork: 93.33% (mean: 93.8%; I forgot to submit on one week)<br /><br />55% Final: 11/15 (mean: 7.1 based on Canvas)<br />30% Midterm: 40/50 (mean: 24.2, SD: 11.9)<br />or<br />85% Final: 11/15 (mean: 7.1 based on Canvas)<br /><br />Final Grade: 78.33% (mean: 61.6, SD: 20.5) under Scheme 1<br />B+<br /><br />Roughly 0.75SD above for a B+. I have a friend who scored exactly 1SD above and also received a B+.<br /><br />I can't imagine what the letter grade for mean or below mean is. To my knowledge, 1 SD above should receive an A-.<br /><br />Furthermore, the grading of scheme 2 was absolutely illogical and stupid. This fall-term arrangement for finals had 12 multiple-choice questions overall -- 10 questions worth one point and 2 questions worth 2 points. Each student had two attempts to do the exam on Canvas. Let me just rant about how I did the computation and losing just one point was equivalent to a 5.x% decrease in the final grade.<br /><br />The printed final examination (based on the sample final) includes questions on a broader range of topics and is more indicative of one's level of understanding of the course.<br /><br />Combining the preposterous and overwhelming weight of 85%, along with the disappointing letter grade, you get MATH 1012.",
            "comment_workload": "There is Math homework on the Webwork platform that is released weekly and accounts for 15% of the final grade. Make sure to do the homework and try to score 100%. Set up a weekly reminder if you have to. If there's a question you've been stuck on, don't be afraid to search for the answer on Google or use software like Wolfram Alpha. It's not worth it to end up forgetting about the homework entirely.<br /><br />As for the midterm and final, Math is all about practice. The lecture notes generally provide a complete overview of what you need to know. It isn't enough though, and you should definitely practice on past papers to get a feel of the exam structure and adequate pacing.<br /><br />MATH 1012 barely has any past papers. Throughout the course, students were provided only the 2015 version of the midterm and finals. In contrast, you should practice on MATH 1013 past papers. The syllabus is 90% similar to MATH 1012, with topics like linear approximation and Newton's Iteration Formula being two of the concepts excluded from the MATH 1012 syllabus. However, questions in MATH 1013 are harder, so if you are able answer them, MATH 1012 will suddenly feel easier. In addition, MATH 1013 has more sets available online with dates from 2012-2016, although not all of the exams have solution sets available to them.<br /><br />As for the midterm of this course, it was very similar to the sample MATH 1012 midterm provided to us. The breakdown of the questions by topic were almost the same -- long questions included a topic on limits, derivatives, and graphing. Multiple choice also contained questions that only had their values changed.",

He provides proof for each equation which are unnecessary and time-consuming, and I'm sure you have all seen his bad comments everywhere, whether of UST space, LIHKG or goop. Many people complain that he speaks ~10 'uuuhhhhs' in each sentence, but I don't think it really matters, because he's in MATH department, right? <br /><br />I strongly suggest you revise TA's notes, which are neat and useful. For starters, you can see Phyllis Liang's notes, which can be found by searching her name on google.

            "comment_workload": "First off, don't be scared by the credit that this course carries, because it is not accurate (some 2 credit courses are so chur) <br /><br />The good thing for 1012 is that the online homework assignments, which is done in a system called webwork, allows students to have unlimited attempts, while 1013 only has 5 attempts per question. Thus, you should get a full 25% if you do it.<br /><br />Why I gave the workload a C is that it requires time to get to know the concepts of different topics. A good way to do it is to review TA's notes, which are listed in the 'teaching' section above.<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask! Glad to help",

(Critical Points)<br />Week 9 Derivatives and the shape of a graph; L'Hopital's Rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Week 10 Curve sketching; optimization problems<br />Week 11 Antiderivatives; areas and distance travelled<br />Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Week 13 Net change; substitution rule<br /><br />The content was very doable since I learnt more than half of it in IB SL Math so I only had to study Limits, L'Hopitals Rule, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Riemann Sums. Also, I had to get used to the university style questions as they require more thought than high school questions. Study Avery's long note documents as the exam questions are very similar to that.",
            "comment_teaching": "Honestly, Avery is one of the smartest professors I have seen in HKUST but being completely honest, he can't teach. He says &quot;uhhh&quot; half the time and goes about solving questions in a way which I am not used to. Don't worry if you don't understand his methodology. There are much easier ways to do the questions. Alternatively, you can turn to YouTubers such as Khan Academy or PatrickJMT who are able to teach you the content in a brief and concise manner. But as aforementioned, his note documents are the key to success in his class. Do make sure you can do every question.<br /><br />However, do go for Phyllis's tutorials. She is one of the best TA's in the math department and her notes are so jeng. She has everything one must know for the topic and all sorts of difficulty of questions.",

Avery Ching did not provide lecture ppt and all the notes were in hand-written format during the lesson. <br />One advantage of Wang ErXiao was that his lecture notes were well-organized, so I could self-study by reading his lecture notes, and learn from the example.",

I got B+ finally.<br />I would like to share my story here. Normally, all students taking this course are year 1 but I took this course in year3 the first time because of some reasons. I was afraid of this course since the first semester in year1 until I got a unexpected grade finally. The content was definitely terrible and unacceptable. I have a twin brother studying at UST as well, who got B+ in this subject too. He has studied M2 in high school but dropped it in form 5. He said math1012 content required 2 years to be taught in secondary school. But we need to learn both form4 and form5 knowledges within 3 months. <br />If it had not been for my twin brother who taught me the math1012 content in advance, during the winter break and summer holiday in year1 and year2, I must not be able to pass this course.",

I also went to math support center to ask for some questions. But some of the tutors in math support center were a little bit arrogant and inapproachable. The attitude of one tutor who is a bit old was extraordinarily poor. When i was talking to another tutor who taught the tutorial of my session, the old tutor suddenly joined the conversation and his tone and content seemed like punishing me. Fortunately, there was a student helper who taught me patiently every time. I remember he needed to be on duty for 2 hours that day, he spended 2 hours to answer my questions and i understood the questions of the past paper completely. Otherwise, i would not ace the final exam. I was exceedingly grateful for his help but I don’t know how to contact him and thank for him, which is a pity.<br />A suggestion for you is that for a few sets of exercises concerning the calculation of differentiation, limit and integration, you can surf the internet and type differentiation calculator, limit calculator and integration calculator to help you get the answer if you don't know how to do or have no time.",

How can I do implicit differentiation just after introducing what differentiation is ????? Man, I just know what is chain rule and power rule?? HOW?<br />But I've heard some of my friends suffered in the heavy Mandarin accent of other lecturers, they couldn't put up with it lmao. So maybe CHAN is fair la.<br /><br />LIANG is good. She explained step by step at a fair pace. I like how she makes the notes simple, especially for limit, differentiation and integration. Idk if it is my problem or not, for trigo at the beginning, I just self-learnt it cuz I didn't understand what she was talking about.<br /><br />TSANG, Henry Pak Yeung IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!<br />Makes funny and daddy jokes and tell us some interesting things in ust, and makes the math lesson in a good atmosphere.

            "comment_teaching": "For Zhang, her teaching style is quite mediocre and boring. But she should be much better than Avery Ching. Her powerpoint slides can help me make clear the theorem of different M2 concepts. She can also give me an immediate email reply with clear answer when I have some problems about exam preparation. Her performance may thus be moderate.<br /><br />For Walter Chan, I just want to say a big thank to him. His note, tone and teaching style can basically eliminate most of my misunderstanding of those complicated content. His notes also highly focus on practical side, which provide many chances for effective practice. If you just study and revise those notes, getting B+ is possible.",

The unlimited attempt mechanism does really help me a lot, especially in the situation of getting a ungood exam result.<br /><br />For the online exam, the difficulty is a bit lower as it is a open book exam. However, some of the questions were still quite demanding for student ability. So, don't think that it was too easy.",

Although hardworking may not help you get A grade, at least it can prevent the re-take of this course. Believe me, you don't want to face Avery possibly again.",

However, even with only an SL math understanding, the concepts of this course can definitely be tackled with hard work and study of the textbook. <br /><br />Yet even if you do this, the questions on the exams are much harder than most you would have practised. To add onto that, Professor Avery likes to trick his students. It seems that the only way to get A+ is to work from day 1 and truly have a clear understanding of the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I STRONGLY SUGGEST FINDING THE TEXTBOOK FOR SELF-STUDY",

It is very hard to actually learn from his lectures as he skips a lot of steps, making it very confusing for people who aren't well versed in maths. <br /><br />The most redeeming part of the teaching component in this course is the tutorials.

            "comment_teaching": "There are two 1.5 hrs lecture per week held by Dr. Wei, mainly focus on proofing the theory, which I found useless in order to pass the exams. Yet his teaching is way better than Avery, his accent is acceptable. <br /><br />However, the big tutorial (50mins) and small tutorial (50mins) held by Kenneth Ng (TA) per week are very useful as he mainly focus on how to solve the problem. He will explain everything clearly and definitely feel his passion in teaching! Quite unfortunate that he resigned this semester as he applied research position :( <br /><br />All in all, you could skip all the lectures but attending tutorial is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

I failed last year because I can't catch up the content and the TA cant help as they are not really patient and teach well. So I spent the whole summer to understand and drilling the course content (so actually I spent 6 months to prep this course!). You definitely need others help because lecturer and TA are not enough. For ppl who take this course for the first time, you better pay extra effort. For maths noob (like me), you will know the pain :(",

In Kitty's tutotial, the good thing is that her notes are very comprehensive and neat with the working steps clearly shown, despite her weakness in explaning stuff( or my weakness in understanding lol). In Zeta's tutorial, he will show many examples of different types of questions. If you are stuck at some junctures and ask him, he can point it out quickly and clarify your mind.

Making sure you are with him when he is writing.<br /><br />There is a break within every lecture. Feel free to ask him questions when in doubt. His explanation is generally detailed and understandable.<br />Right before midterm and final, he will teach us to do some past paper questions. 1013's questions are really challenging when compared to 1012's.<br /><br />Zeta Chan:<br />Exam-oriented style. You should take a copy of his note and do practices on the questions of the note. This is particularly important for those who didn't study M2 before.<br /><br />His explanation to solving questions is clear. Attending his tutorial is really quite optional because there are recorded videos uploaded on canvas afterwards.

It's quite difficult to understand his accent, plus his teaching is worse than Avery's. Plus, although he can be approached in the MSC, he seems to &quot;look down&quot; on you.<br /><br />The other TA (AU, Cheuk Yin), however, is the reason why the teaching of this course got a D and not an E.

It was very difficult to understand what he is trying to say. One of my classmates even made a whole list of words he pronounced weirdly, so that’s the only thing we can laugh about in this course I guess.<br /><br />But if you want to hear about some of his redeeming qualities, he seems like a pretty chill guy outside of class time. He is willing to share some details of his earlier life if you ask in Mandarin. Also it’s his first year teaching here, so his lack of experience is sort of expected.<br /><br />If the prof is Yin, the TA Phyllis is the Yang, more respectfully known as the hand that gives MATH1012 students another life.

It's basically M2 stuff with a few additional theorems like the mean-value theorem and L'hôpital rule. For those who have not taken M2 it could be a little bit hard to follow, so make sure don't skip any lectures, no matter how useless you think they are. Tutorials are good opportunities to have some practice and ask more &quot;technical&quot; questions, and before coming to the tutorials it's necessary to clarify the concepts in lectures first.<br /><br />Topics include:<br />♦ Functions and their graphs;<br />♦ Trigonometric functions, exponential and log functions and their inverses;<br />♥ Limits, asymptotes of graphs, continuity;<br />♥ Derivatives of elementary functions, product and quotient rules, chain rule.<br />♥ Implicit differentiations.<br />♥ Rate of changes.<br />♠ Extrema of functions. The mean value theorem.<br />♥ Increasing and Decreasing functions. Curve sketching.<br />Optimizations.<br />♠ L'hôpital rule.<br />♠ Riemann sums and definite integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.<br />♥ Integration by Substitution.<br /><br />♦ DSE Maths Compulsory Parts<br />♥ DSE Maths Extended M2 Parts<br />♠ New Topics",
            "comment_teaching": "CHING, Avery is a very clear-minded and logical professor, and he is able to present the basic concepts very well. However, he focuses mainly on the &quot;philosophy&quot; of maths rather than the &quot;technical&quot; aspects of how to solve mathematical problems. Sometimes he just confuses us even more as he gets more in depth in his own philosophy. If you can't catch up make sure you go to the Maths Support Center and don't be afraid to raise questions.<br /><br />CHAN, Yun Hung (TA), on the other way round, focuses on solving problems more than introducing and explaining concepts. He has a very bad Hong Kong accent, and many international students complained that they didn't understand. However it should be understandable for the locals. As time is limited he often teaches VERY fast in the lectures. Make sure you really take out a piece of paper and a pen to have a try solving the problem, but not just sit there looking as he writes.
