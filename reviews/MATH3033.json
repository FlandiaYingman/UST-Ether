Vector-valued functions: limit, differentiation, inverse function theorem, implicit function theorem<br />The following is not related to vector-valued functions, i.e. only single variable functions are discussed.<br />2. Sequences and series of functions: limit superior/inferior, pointwise convergence, taylor series, uniform convergence (continuity/integration/differentiation theorem, L-Test, Weierstrass M-Test, Dini's Theorem, Abel's Limit Theorem)<br />Emphasis is put on uniform convergence.<br />3. Set operations, images and inverse images<br />Content of this part is short, but quite important for later studies.<br />4. Lebesgue measure and integration on the real line: 5 steps: study of sets; measurable sets; measurable functions; Lebesgue integral and its properties; convergence theorems<br />The hardest part of this course. I find measurable sets and measurable functions quite hard to deal with.<br />Note that in this course you are not required to understand the proofs of the theorems but to apply the theorems.",

Some problems are hard, but you can seek help from TA or the professor.<br />Midterm is just some homework/presentation type problems. Practise more and memorise the taylor series of sine, cosine, e^x, ln(1+x), arctan(x).<br />For final, do go to the review session (the last class) for some ideas on the problem types (the last 2 or 3 problems are usually difficult). Read past papers that Kin Li sends. And good luck.<br />Attached are corrections on the notes, one supplement, and midterm/final reviews.",

Usually there will be 1 or 2 questions about proofs and those are the main deciding factor of whether you do well or not.<br /><br />The workload of the course is super light, since it is just assignments and two exams. However, if you want to do well, then you might have to put in a lot more time depending on how comfortable you are with proofs.<br /><br />If you have some mathematical maturity, you shouldn’t have any trouble with this course and it won’t take too much of your time (I only read the lecture notes to do the assignments and studied 1-2 days before the exams). If you’re confident in your math skills, want a challenge, and can put in a lot of time towards studying, you should try to take 3043 instead.<br /><br />However, if you struggled with 2033, then you will definitely have a hard time with this course if you want to do well.",

Homework 1 consists of 5 problems (exactly the same throughout each term Kin Li is teaching), while homework 2 consists of 3 problems (not the same from previous terms). Feel free to see the problems and the solutions in the attachment.<br />2. Midterm exam is NOT entirely past paper analysis exam. If you revise and analyse past paper problems, you would obtain 50% of the exam.<br />3. Breakdown of midterm exam:<br />* Question 1: Differentiability and Continuity<br />(a) Proof a function is CONTINUOUS (not on past paper): 10 marks<br />(b) Proof a function is DIFFERENTIABLE (from past paper): 10 marks<br />* Question 2: Inverse Function Theorem (20 marks)<br />Just from past paper<br />* Question 3: Implicit Function Theorem (20 marks)<br />From midterm review.<br />(a) Given (a,b) is a solution to the equation f(x,y) = c, show that near (a,b), y can be expressed as differentiable function of x.<br />(b) Near (a,b), can x be expressed as differentiable function of y? Justify your answer.<br />* Question 4: Sequence and Series of Functions<br />(a) Expand f(x) = exp(...) using Taylor series (6 marks)<br />(b) Proof the series of function is uniformly convergent on [a,b] (8 marks)<br />Use M-test<br />(c) Prove integral from a to b of f(x) is ... (6 marks)<br />* Question 5: Limsup and Liminf (new problem)<br />(a) Proof using Cauchy-Schwarz, triangle inequality etc (8 marks)<br />(b) If limsup a_n = limsup b_n = 1, prove ... (12 marks)<br />4. Final exam is even harder in my opinion than the midterm exam. See the problems and its solution in the attachment. Problem 1 is from past paper again, but that's only problem that's similar to past paper :(. <br />5. The &quot;curve&quot; is combined from L1 and L2, since exam questions are the same.<br />6. My scores:<br />* Homework + presentation =&gt; full mark<br />* Midterm: 74 (1.25 SD above mean)<br />* Final: 77 (~1.85 SD above mean)<br />* Total = 82.4 (grade: A-)<br />I think people from L2 have better scores than L1 students. Note the mean is only for L1 section<br />* You tell by yourself whether it is good grade or not.",
            "comment_workload": "Oh well... before midterm, the workload is quite light. Just complete 1 homework and 1 presentation exercise. Before the exam, make sure you read the transparencies well if you want to score high (there's some rumours that hai zhang was going to prepare the questions, turned out it was true), and not only the past papers.<br /><br />One week after midterm, classes were cancelled. After the adjustment, many people actually quite happy, since they can choose P/F for this course (knowing the mean is only 49). At first, Kin Li said P/F is not allowed. But luckily, he said P/F is allowed, but to get a P, we need to obtain 35% for the final exam. After few emails from other students, finally, Kin Li decides that a total score of 40% is enough to get a P; no need to take final exam if your current total score is already 40%.<br />So nice... thanks Kin Li.",

You just need to memorize 1) how to prove differentiability of vector-valued functions and 2) inverse / implicit function theorem<br /><br />2. Uniform Convergence:<br />The concept itself is quite hard to grasp at first, since it can be quite tricky to differentiate uniform and pointwise convergence at first. But, once you grasp the concept, you just have to memorize theorems such as M-Test and it won't be quite hard to deal with exam problems.<br /><br />3. Lebesgue Measure &amp; Integration (BOSS DIFFICULTY):<br />This is probably the most challenging concept I had to deal with in my entire academic history. There are many theorems and properties you have to memorize, and it's really hard to grasp the concept of &quot;measure&quot; (since it is really abstract) and Lebesgue integration. The finals are basically a test on this part, so... yeah. Good luck with this (you will need it).",

You will find this way help you appreciate what you are studying, as well as leading to a better grade. Then that means you are not choosing the wrong major, or at least find some meaning from your major! <br /><br />For the content of Real Analysis, please find other comments. <br /><br />My Comment: This is a nice and useful course, esp. Lebesgue measure... U can google how useful it is in real life! Math is not just a piece of art (yeah I enjoy it :D like viewing the good scene and good drawing...different type of beauty :] ) but also practical... :)&nbsp;&nbsp;If u want to go deeper properly u shd go 3043.",
            "comment_teaching": "Kin Li is a good professor. If you have somethings that do not understands, u can talk to him. But the lecture is just reading contents in the lecture notes. (u dun hv to &quot;take attendance&quot;... not bad but not good. ) But sometimes he would have some elaboration more than the notes. I would say depends on whether u want to self-study or not. It can keep ur motivation for studying ge. For me, I prefer self-study everything in a short time.<br /><br />The notes are quite clear. It states the motivation for the topic, and then go into the definition, and finally some related theorems. The logic flow is clear...<br /><br />TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN FINAL, u need to look for THE FINAL REVIEW to learn some tricks... since I think it is quite hard to think of them in the exam...maybe my problem. <br /><br />Although proof of the theorem is not required, the tricks used are useful to learn. NOT only for this course but other math areas.",
            "comment_grading": "Mean: B- to C+<br />Half people C range.<br /><br />***********************************<br />GRADING REFERENCE<br />Hw: ~Full <br />Midterm: ~Full (mean 79)<br />Presentation: Full<br />Final: 60+ to 70+ (mean 33)<br />(A+ need much higher...)<br />=&gt; A<br />***********************************<br />COMMENT: <br /><br />MIDTERM<br />The midterm is easy. To get high score, you can use the strategy of 'memorisation of past paper'. But to learn better, you should *also* use your logic to study it. It is used for giving scores to student s.t. he can fail fewer ppl. <br /><br />FINAL<br />Final is much harder. About ~25 to 30&nbsp;&nbsp;scores are relatively easy to get, which can use the strategy of 'memorisation of past paper' as well. This is the mean score(33). And the remaining questions are harder to solve. It requires a clear mindset (on the topic, and higher score require concepts on general maths concepts like the definition of limit, differentiation, etc...dun forget them after u take the courses in a junior level like MATH1023, MATH1024, MATH2033 LOL... In fact, learning math is a continuous progress :D), creativity and *luck* (ME this time :D Maybe I am not strong enough so I need luck...I guess top students dun need luck? ) to solve. Therefore, if u dun think u are smart, better start learning it (dun just memorize my fd, this is math but not computational courses...math is a piece of art in logic :P) earlier, not before the exam. Otherwise, I think u can only get &lt;3x score at max. ? If u are smart, then ok u can ignore me. I dunno how smart u are so I dunno how to comment LOL. Usually, solving one more question other than the easy one can have A- grade(?). I can observe that Kin Li is trying to find some point from your answer book to give a score. So he is loosely grading the final exam. Thanks, Kin Li ;D...",

I read through the lecture notes and they are similar to the examples in notes. <br /><br />MIDTERM: <br />I revise 2 days for midterm. If you only want to copy and paste, maybe 1 day is enough. <br /><br />FINAL: <br />And I start to learn Lebesgue measure (only coverage) 3 days intensively before the final...LOL... Not reli good hobby in fact. But I consider myself as a fast learner so that it is fine for me. Maybe few more days can lead me to A+... BTW I think the notes and review questions are very clear already...I didn't read other stuffs. Not sure if it is helpful to do more questions by urself?",
