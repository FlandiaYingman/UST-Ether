You will be given full credit if you &quot;seriously attempted&quot; the questions.) Prof will also provide sample Midterm questions hence it won't take you much time for revision.",

The models are very complicated to understand which require substantial time to find out what is going on. Math parts are not difficult but you have to understand the principles beforehand. You have to be good in micro , otherwise it takes some time for you to understand the models.<br />The second part focuses on foreign exchange market. This part is much easier than the first part, especially if you are good in macro. It is basically a extended part of IS-LM model which associates outputs, interest rates and exchange rates. It is much straight-forward than the first part, so in the exam.<br />You will find the topics quite useful in daily life, at least you understand more about what is going on in the trade wars and currency exchange markets.",
            "comment_teaching": "Acceptable teaching but not interesting. He attempts to cover a lot of topics but he doesn't have enough to time to do so. So he rushes so fast. <br />He is quite approachable and always willing to answer students' question.<br />Overall he is not bad.",

It is not difficult to be above mean if you study hard.<br /><br />Final Exam - 40%\t<br />2 Mid-term exams - 22.5% each<br />Assignments - 10%\t<br />Attendance and Participation - 5%",

You may not have enough time if you do it too slowly.<br />The most difficult part is to understand the materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each chapters consists of 50-60 slides which just highlight the most important part of the chapter.
