        "description": "How can financial tools be used to solve societal issues we are facing in today’s world? The reputation of the financial industry has gone down dramatically since the 2008 financial crisis; many social advocates have blamed greedy financiers for disrupting people’s lives. However, this course will illustrate that finance can be a powerful tool to achieve societal goals by having a positive impact on the environment and society as a whole. The course will cover new theories on responsible finance and include case studies that are relevant to the responsibility of firms. The course will follow most of the parts of the curriculum of the CFA Institute’s Certificate in ESG Investing. Therefore, students taking this course will have a good start with tackling this new CFA certification.",
