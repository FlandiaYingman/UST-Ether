            "title": "FYP in Bamboo Engineering",
            "comment_content": "The main focus of the project is experimental testing of bamboo axial member with bolt connection on steel plate. The aim of experiment is to characterise the yield strength and ductility of the particular type of bamboo connection. Our FYP group is rather big with 5 members, and totally we tested 40 specimens in this year.",
            "comment_teaching": "As this is a project, it is difficult to comment on this part. But to be honest, I am very disappointed with Ilias's supervision. Normally professor will meet with FYP students at least once a month. For Ilias, our group only meet him twice in the entire year, first time in September (~30 min) and second time in January (~1 hour) when we have a interim presentation to him. Then the third and last time we meet him is in the final presentation..... I am not sure if he is busy on other stuff, maybe doing preparation for getting research funding. But I think a responsible supervisor should do more than that, at least not meeting only two times with his students in the entire year..... One of my disgruntled with Ilias is his attitude toward his UG students. I feel that he is indifferent with what we learn and what we work on, he only value his research and the experiments of his research postgraduate student. And according to the experience of me and my groupmates, Ilias always miss our email (base on my statistics the missing rate is 66%). Personally I don't think Ilias is too busy to reply email, every professor are busy, but instead I believe Ilias just simply didn't take us seriously from the beginning. <br />For the postgraduate tutor of this project, he shares the same attitude with Ilias (所謂臭罌出臭草), not acting as a tutor but only as a boss who demand us to collect experimental data for him. Except the experimental procedure, I don't think he has teach us anthing useful. The tutor is not a considerate person. Throughout the year, there are several time we have argument with the PG tutor on the workload. We tried to ask Ilias to mediate the conflict, but he has no intention to get involved. I don't mind he shows his support to his PG student, but I am really disappointed that he did nothing to solve the problem.",
            "comment_grading": "Considering the heavy workload of this particular project, I would say the grade is extremely poor. There are 5 people working in this project and majority of us get A- only (average grade of FYP), which do not reflect our effort especially our time spent (waste) in lab. Even though there seems to be a fair system to assess our performance by a panel, their assessment are not independent. The supervisor can made comment in the panel meeting and influence other's decisions. Ilias is not a linient person and his grade is poor than average. Also I don't see any chance to impress other panel members as Ilias and the tutor didn't teach us knowledge that are &quot;useful&quot; and presentable. You can imagine that the experimental procedure won't be interesting.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload of this project is very heavy, far more than other FYP topic after comparing with my friends. The time we spent in the lab is 6 hours per week in average (even when the University switch to online class in spring semester, but it is somehow reasonable as this is an experimental topic), but we still have other work such as literature review, data analysis, design calculation and drawing, and report writing. I think the workload for this project is between 2-3 regular 3 credit course per semester. I have heard how heavy the workload is in CIVL3320 Reinforced Concrete Design after Ilias become the instructor. So you can image what is Ilias's expectation to &quot;normal FYP workload&quot;. However, the heavy workload doesn't mean we learn equivalent knowledge from it, because we spent two third of time preparing specimens and doing experiment, which contains very little technical content. We are supposed to learn to become engineer, not technician or woodworking worker. Of course this is a very good deal for Ilias to let his FYP students do the experiements, as he don't have to spent his funding to hire lab technician or research assistant, and his research students can still get the experimental data for their thesis. (Bare in mind that research student have studentship but FYP student get nothing! What a GOOD DEAL, Ilias. I must admit that this man is very good at calculating, and manipulative) The only benefit for me in the experiment is I don't have to go to gym, but still able to train my muscle through cutting and drilling bamboo, moving the bamboo from the warhouse, assembling the bamboo with the heavy steel connector (btw the new connector our group design weights 24kg, so good luck to those who would take up our project :) I would recommend those who want to become a woodworking worker, and don't mind to do unpaid work, this is a perfect topic for you. For those who want to become engineer, choose another topic (probably not Ilias's project).",
