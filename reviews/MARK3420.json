For the first month and a half, before the prof introduced the project properly, everything was super chill. I attended most lectures, but I didn't spend any time on this course outside of class. Even for the final exam I felt like there was no point studying (my goal was only to pass since I chose P/F grading) since most of the stuff was logic/understanding based, so I just chilled and it was fine. The only high workload part is the group project, but it's not any more than a normal SBM group project would be, so at this point you should be fine.",
