Lovely, can I have my time back please?<br /><br />As an example - For the final, I pushed through to rewatch all the lectures, understand all the concepts, and literally quoted the prof and concepts he said for the definition section - still got below mean. They don't even think what they taught in class is the correct answer AHAHHA",

You will spend more time trying to understand what it is they want than actually learning anything. <br /><br />I was so frustrated I asked the teaching team why I got so many marks deducted for 'presentation of ideas' they said, I should explain more clearly. Thanks, that is very unhelpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As mentioned above, they don't even know what they want. If you do badly in this course, its actually a compliment, it means you won't end up doing data entry at a big four for minimum wage, congrats!",
