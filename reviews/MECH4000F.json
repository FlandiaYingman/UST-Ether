        "description": "Educational psychologist David Kolb has strongly advocated that experiential learning as \"the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience\". By taking this course the students will come to realise how theoretical knowledge can be applied to real engineering product design and manufacturing through experiencing all 4 stages of Kolb's experiential learning cycle. The core of the course will be taught by demonstrating how a scaled down EV is made and unfolding its design concepts one by one. For that, we will first design and build an EV before the course starts. This demo EV will be developed together with an experienced technician who will be helping to collect EV performance data, compile the BOM, and manufacture or outsource EV components, assemble the whole EV frame incorporating with an electromechanical motor system for transmission, test and debug the EV on the road. Instructor's approval is required.",

The importance of Voice of Customers (VOC), CTQ and how they can be cascaded down into the different improvement initiatives proposed by the students themselves. In the beginning of the course, a simple EV will be anatomized and explained in details what components are there in an EV and why and how each major component/ subassembly is made and functions. Based upon the VOC and design and manufacturing methodologies behind, each group of students (5-6 persons per group) will have to come up with a working EV based upon the groupâ€™s initiatives within the scope defined by VOC.",
