        "description": "This course aims to introduce the basic mathematical tools and techniques used in the field of imaging and medical imaging, which is becoming increasingly important nowadays. Topics covered: 1. the mathematical modelling of imaging modality; 2. inversion step where measurements are used to generate the imaging; 3. image quality analysis and processing. Emphasis is given to the image quality analysis such as resolution and artifacts and their relations to the mathematical modeling, sampling, inversion scheme and signal to noise level. Students are expected to have the basic background of multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",
