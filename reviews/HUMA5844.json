        "description": "This course will closely read selection from four scriptures in the history of the Chan (also known as Zen) Buddhism. Through close analyses of the Bodhidharma Sutra, the Lankavatara Sutra, the Vajracchedika-prajna-paramita Sutra, and the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, students will be introduced to major issues in the philosophy of Chan Buddhism, and the interactions between Chan Buddhism and Taoism will also be examined. Textual readings will be paired with current scholarship on issues including the origins and Taoist influences, the meaning of Buddha-nature, the methods of Koan, and the practices of meditation.",
