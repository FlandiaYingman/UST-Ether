We are expected to identify the legal issues involved, discuss the relevant legal principles and apply them to resolve the issues. This framework will be used very often when answering questions in the exam.<br /><br />The content is extremely useful in clarifying common legal misconceptions in our daily lives and notifying us of proper legal actions that should be taken in case of a breach of the law.<br /><br />Note that this course has little to do with accounting. NOT recommended for year 1 (except for those genii) or anyone not sufficiently proficient in English - this is far too demanding for a year-1 student.

He's also extremely kind to us, and willing to answer questions when we got stuck on the group project.<br /><br />‚ùå However his notes are a little bit messy, so make sure you organize them well. We're also required to jot down a lot of notes in the lessons cuz these are very likely to appear on exams. If you skip his lessons, good luck in the exams.",
            "comment_grading": "Exam sucks. If you've put down the points mentioned in the marking scheme, you get the points. If you don't, you lose marks. It's basically just a game of tipping the marking scheme instead of assessing your critical thinking and legal reasoning ability. Make sure you write as much as possible in the exams to get the marks. Even if some of the issues in the questions do not have a role in the final decision, you're still required to fully explain them.<br /><br />Charles likes to test concepts that are only discussed in class but not mentioned in his lecture notes, so make sure you attend his classes and jot down everything he mentions. Pay extra attention to those topics during your revision.<br /><br />‚úèÔ∏è Group research paper (20%)<br />‚úèÔ∏è Midterm exam (35%)<br />‚úèÔ∏è Final exam (35%)<br />‚ùì Class participation (10%)<br /><br />Nobody knows how it's graded. Only the midterm result was released, and I did quite poorly on that one (slightly below mean). The marks for the final exam and the project were not released. The class participation part is even more ambiguous. There's no participation card thingy, no presentation, nothing! Maybe he gives participation marks purely based on his memory and impression.<br /><br />Final grade: B+",
            "comment_workload": "A double-sized A4 (either written or printed) cheat-sheet is allowed in the exams. This reduces the workload quite a bit.<br /><br />The legal paper is still far too demanding to us. It's a 4000-to-4500-word essay finished by groups of 5. We're required to conduct legal research in depth from authoritative sources (Wikipedia and Google are not acceptable), critically analyze the pros and cons of the current law/political system, point out existing defects in the laws, conduct comparative studies with overseas examples, and come up with viable solutions to resolve the current issues/improve the legal system.<br /><br />Our group was assigned a topic that required us to assess in the current electoral system in Hong Kong and analyze whether it conforms to democratic principles. Damn it - it's a super hard topic. I think it's more like politics than law. I wonder if we had the ability to come up with such great solutions, would we still need to sit in lectures and get tortured by all those sh!t grades? We could have been the Chief Executive then.<br /><br />Make sure you get responsible and CAPABLE group-mates to do the work, or you'll end up with spending days revising all the group work in frustration.",

And actually, you won't wanna miss Charles' lectures coz they are actually quite interesting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he got a stroke at early Apr and was hospitalized, so the TA, KK Lee, became the emergent substitute instructor for the rest of the semester. The TA was just basically reading out the powerpoint for every lesson so I didn't pay much attention and skipped some lectures.<br /><br />That's why I gave an overall B in teaching coz Charles deserved more than an A and KK Lee is a D.<br /><br />Update:<br />Sadly, Charles passed away at 15 May due to the severe stroke he suffered at early April.

Maybe it's from KK Lee's impression on us during lectures (?) Do bear in mind that if you asked questions during the group project presentations, he'll mark your name down and you may score higher in participation.<br /><br />For the group project, every group will be randomly assigned a topic from a list created by Charles beforehand. Originally, Charles required us to have a 4000-word limit and with footnotes and 1.5-line spacing. But after KK Lee took over, he said that there was no word limit and we can do whatever format we like provided that it's clear. Each group will also need to present their findings in class. Originally, KK Lee set the time limit to 10 mins as the syllabus does, but then he cancelled the time limit. What happened then is that some groups presented for over 20 mins and some groups need to delay their presentation to the next lessons as a result, so he kind of set a limit again for around 15 mins. The arrangement was messy.<br /><br />Midterm was still under Charles' reign. There were two short questions and two case study questions, covering the first two chapters. An A4 double-sided cheatsheet is allowed.<br /><br />Final was under KK Lee's reign. He conducted a survey in class and decided to have an open book open notes exam. There will be MCs and short questions on Contract Law, contents from the guest lecture on professional ethics, legal systems around the world, Tort Law and Employment Law, and case study questions for only the latter two topics.",
            "comment_workload": "The group project constitutes the most workload. You'll need to do lots of research and dig into the current laws as well as reading lots of news related to your topic in order to find loopholes in the law and make legal recommendations to it. However, it was quite fun as you got to know much more about what Hong Kong (or China or common law states like UK and US) is currently going on. Since I have an interest in law and politics, I actually quite like doing the project. But for others, well... good luck.<br /><br />For the midterm, I had gone through the powerpoints, Charles' supplementary notes and notes from his lectures for more than once in order to find useful information to be written on the cheatsheet. It was hard work.<br /><br />For the final, it's open book open notes, so everyone can just print out all the slides and notes and bring them alongside the textbook (which is optional) into the exam venue. You don't need to memorize a lot of stuff but as it's open nearly everything... it's going to be tough I think.",

Do start early as legal terms and phrases might be hard to comprehend. Utilize the knowledge learnt in contract law to generate arguments.<br />Tip: Use lawteacher.com and look at the case summary of your case!<br /><br />For in-class assignment, she will spend one lecture to introduce the IRAC structure, and then next lecture you will be given a case to analyse, using IRAC. The purpose of this is actually to help you familize with the IRAC structure, in which you need to use when writing the Final Report as well.<br /><br />For Individual Participation &amp; Group Exercise, just submit after-class reflection and attend lectures for mini-quizzes/in-class exercises.

Need to come to all his classes to write notes that are as complete as possible because he usually tells us things orally or just written in a paper (ppt not enough). Unfortunately, he passed away in the middle of the sem and was replaced by TA KK Lee.<br /><br />KK Lee - ever since Charles stopped coming to class, TA conducted the lectures which IMO (and maybe others too) was not insightful and simply reading the ppt, so nobody ever came to class anymore and only 5-6 people present. His first few lectures was awfully painful to watch as he was very nervous and awkward, but credits to him for trying his best, and slightly improved after a few weeks. He said that after taking over, he was extremely busy and only slept like 4 hours per day...grading exams and making our final exam. He also outsourced the teaching of our last chapter of business ethics to some guy, whatever it was as bad. It seemed like he was very tired cus when we presented in class for group project, he sat in front row and literally was falling asleep and struggling to be awake lmao<br /><br />Overall i think the teaching from TA onwards doesnt really matter because you can study the notes yourself and print it all out since it's open book. No idea who's going to be permanently replacing Charles Lam for next sems...",

No MCs. You're allowed to bring a 2-sided A4 cheat sheet. As long as you copy all the legal principles and relevant examples, you should be able to handle the exams. Also, the questions were mainly based on the discussion questions + the notes he wrote on the whiteboard, i.e. extra points that were NOT on the PPT. <br /><br />For the Mid Term, there were 2 essay questions on exemption clause and contract law respectively. They resemble the discussion questions in class. <br /><br />For the Final, there were short questions about ethical issues such as minimum wage. <br /><br />There's no absolute right or wrong in law as long as you could back your argument with legal principles. So for the essay part, try to elaborate your point with legal principles with examples. <br /><br />I don't think we did particularly well in the Paper. Got around 1.7 SD above mean in Mid term.

            "comment_content": "The topics are incredibly interesting if you'd like to understand a bit of the basics of business law. The course covers the fundamentals of each topic (Basic concepts of law, the legal system in HK/China, contract law, employment law, tort law and business ethics). <br /><br />You don't need to be afraid of the course code - trust me. I chose this course last semester because there was really nothing else to take. I thought it'd be awful but it turned out to be the best course choice by far.",
            "comment_teaching": "Charles is super friendly and likes to make lots of jokes (though no one laughs). He uses powerpoints and a ton of word documents that contain 'past paper questions'. A typical class consists of him going through the powerpoints and then applies the concepts you just learned in the questions. You can feel free to interrupt him at any point in time to ask questions - he's always happy to clarify. <br /><br />Attendance is not compulsory even though there are 'participation points'. BUT if you want to do well (which I presume you do), you NEED TO GO TO CLASS. Charles' PPT &amp; notes (which he uploads to LMES) are not comprehensive enough. He often adds additional information. If you're a fan of taking a lot of notes and then exactly regurgitating everything the professor says then this is the class for you, seriously.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is pretty fair to be honest. <br />Mid term 35%<br />Final 35%<br />Participation 10%<br />Group Project 20%<br /><br />The group project is the really long essay you write (with other people) on a law topic. You draw this topic out of a hat with the TA. You can then go to Charles and arrange a meeting and pretend you are honestly very confused and hopeless. He will then tell you exactly what he wants in the essay - no joke. He's the nicest person on earth. <br /><br />The 10% participation is a mixture of your questions in class and the verbal presentation you give with your group mates for the group project. Throughout the entire semester I think I asked about two questions... so honestly it doesn't really matter. I've been told that so long as you give the presentation, you get the full 10%. <br /><br />The final exam was a mind blower because half of the paper was on Confucius. We learned business ethics in the last two weeks of the semester and Charles so happened to focus on business ethics for the final. A lot of people thought memorizing business ethics was a waste of their time and didn't revise for it... so... oops?<br /><br />I got 41/50 for the midterm - slightly above mean. He never told us what we got for the group project or final or for participation. I ended up getting an A+.",
            "comment_workload": "I took this course as a terrified Freshman. The course was not as terrifying as what everyone described it to be. <br /><br />The only work you have to do is write a lot/type very quickly in class and then do the essay. That's it. That being said, memorizing information can be difficult. But I assure you that the exam questions are EXACTLY like the past paper questions he goes through in class (except 1 exam question = past paper question 1 + 2 + 3 combined). If you pay attention to class you will get a good grade.",

The course introduces you with the basic concepts of law, such as the legal system in Hong Kong, the employment law, the tort law, the contract law, and the business ethics. It must be emphasized, although the course is with the course code above 3000, it is only an introduction to law. So, it is okay for you to pick the topics up. The most important thing is your effort.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor is a good one. Not only can he explain the abstract concepts of laws clearly with a variety of examples in real-life, but he sometimes makes some jokes so that the lessons are not boring at all. He can cater to the needs of the students, and he welcomes questions. Actually, what is the most important in the lessons is not the notes he distribute, but what he has discussed in the lessons.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is not too good, but fair. One mid-term(35%), one final(35%), attendance(10%), a group project(20%). I scored 32/50 in the midterm. The mean was 38 and the S.D was not shown. I guessed my mark was below 1.5 S.D. My group project was fair. And I guessed I did my final very good because overall I got a B grade.",
            "comment_workload": "As a year-one student, I personally think my decision to take the course is very bad. The examinations cover not only the power-point notes but also what has been discussed in the lessons. So, it is important to attend all the lessons and even take down the notes of what the instructor says. The workload for preparing the examinations is huge. Also, for the group project, the topics are too broad, and it is quite demanding to work on this, especially if you are not interested in the topics. The final thing to say is that if you have the enthusiasm in law, let's take the course, but otherwise, don't risk your GPA.",
