            "comment_content": "The professor just copied everything from the textbook and put the headings as bullet points in his slides. There were a total of 11 chapters, covering business feasibility, business model, financing, marketing etc, to teach you how to set up your business. Just read the textbook and you will be fine.",
            "comment_teaching": "I wondered if the professor really knew what he was doing. Each lecture lasted 2 hours and 50 minutes although there was a 15-minute break after around 1 hour. He spent almost 2/3 of the entire lecture talking nonsense and inviting students to present their assignments which were actually summaries of what he taught last week (I doubted if there was any), interesting facts from the textbook etc. When he finally started teaching, he kept repeating the same points again and again, which were quite irrelevant to the slides. There were lots of exchange students and they were relatively willing to interact with the professor in class. He could not handle questions well and would say something confusing when he did not have the answer. However, he seemed to think his teaching was insightful as he loved asking students if they learnt something from the class. I could not understand why he was hired for UG / MBA programs.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading scheme was not transparent. The professor only published the grade and related statistics for Quiz 1 on Canvas. For the assignments, he provided letter grades only. Nobody knew how well they performed as no grades / statistics were offered regarding Quiz 2, attendance, participation, group project (presentation and business plan).<br /><br />Attendance &amp; Participation - 20%<br />Quiz 1 &amp; Quiz 2 - 40%<br />Group Project (assignments) - 10%<br />Group Project (business plan &amp; presentation) - 30%<br /><br />I went to every class and got the highest score in Quiz 1 - that was the only thing I knew. The final letter grade was B+.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was crazy. There were weekly assignments for each group. When someone in your group did not contribute, it would be even more painful. The professor required students to finish reading a chapter every week and had high expectations for the group project. He would not tell you what he liked / disliked when you tried to generate a business idea. If you think there is much freedom, you are wrong. After my group submitted the business concept statement, he simply said our business would not work. We had to guess his preference and redo it again in addition to designing a new business model. At the end of the day, I did not think he liked our idea much as he kept questioning the profitability of the business. The final business plan had to be 30+ pages long covering various analysis that he only mentioned briefly in class. The textbook was the only thing we could rely on. It was really discouraging when he kept rejecting our ideas without providing guidance to improve the project.",

For example, he once said that there would be no lecture in the following week. But, the truth is you still had to appear in class to to discuss the project with your teammates.

But, it requires us to produce a 100% real and justified business plan. You have to really think about the logistics, financing, accounting budget, marketing plan, HR of your proposed company. After writing the plan, i assure that you can really start doing business!<br />The most unacceptable part is the crowdfunding.

Towards the end of the semester, I noticed he started to ask for the names of those presented and that may contribute to the attendance.<br />Normally he would go through the whole powerpoint deck, but sometimes he just blew too much water and forgot about the slides.<br /><br />The professor himself was okay, even though he called out students' name a lot, it's also okay if you couldn't answer his question.<br /><br />ps. many exchange students attended this course (probably because many of them are seriously considering a startup)",
