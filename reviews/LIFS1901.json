Following the convention, all amino-acid sequences are given with the amino-terminus on the left and carboxyl-terminus on the right. The sequence of 5 amino acids in the &quot;original&quot; protein is shown at the top followed by the 4 different &quot;mutant&quot; amino-acid sequences that are encoded by 4 mutant DNA sequences each of which contains one of the following mutations in the 15-bases sequence: single missense base substitution, single nonsense base substitution, single-base deletion and single-base insertion. Based on this information, determine and report the original and 4 mutant sequences of the 15 bases. For the base-substitution and insertion mutant sequences, highlight the mutated bases using boldface letters. For the deletion mutant sequence, highlight the 2 bases flanking the deleted base with boldface letters. For each mutant sequence, name the kind of mutation it contains (i.e. missense, nonsense, insertion or deletion). Finally, write a possible 15-base sequence that contains a silent mutation from the original 15-base sequence, with the mutated base highlighted with a boldface letter. For all the required DNA sequences, write only the coding strand sequence with 5'-end on the left and 3'-end on the right.<br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />Here is an example: If the given amino acid sequences are<br />Original:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ala&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe<br />Mutant 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ala&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phe<br />Mutant 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ala&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mutant 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser<br />Mutant 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop<br />You should report the following:<br />Original:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mutant 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GTC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missense&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mutant 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nonsense&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mutant 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CTG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deletion <br />Mutant 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TGC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TGA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GTT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;&nbsp;insertion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silent<br />&quot;",

However, I think glycolysis might have been a bit too difficult for everyone.<br /><br />The second half is mainly about genetics, covering DNA transcription and translation, cell reproduction, and mutations. A special topic about viruses was taught and was also part of the exam syllabus. There was not enough time for the last topic which was about classifying different living organisms. This part was comparatively more challenging but was much more in-depth.",

The slides weren't prepared too well too - they often lack clear explanations, leaving us to search the answers online. What's worse is she counts participation points by the iLearn thing, and you'll lose 5% if you miss two lessons. (She also doesn't post the Zoom link publicly, and NIHK students email her to get the link (lol))<br /><br />Hung was absolutely brilliant. He explains very clearly and is very patient and helpful when answering our questions. He has a set of slides provided to students for revision, and he also prepared another set of actively maintained slides for teaching. He sometimes makes animations for explaining processes like B and T cell activation and protein translation. He likes to talk about interesting extra content and ask&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;why does something happen&quot; questions, which I think is a good touch to make us focused and interested.",

More like a student doing his first powerpoint presentation.<br /><br />Eugene’s powerpoint slides are good, explaining much of the details. However, it is better for you to watch his recordings as he explains in greater detail and his presented powerpoints are updated with more information. Eugene’s teaching is decent, but his voice is very soft and makes you asleep.<br /><br />Besides, for Fall 2021, both lectures are 9am - 10.20am lectures on monday and wednesday morning, so i rarely attend them and end up left behind.",

            "comment_teaching": "There are 2 instructors in this course. <br /><br />Before midterm, it is Jessica teaching. Jessica's teaching is interesting. Before the lecture and during break, she would play music to help us relax. She tries to include some jokes in her presentation and this make the lecture more interesting. However, this course is at 9am and there are clicker questions (IPRS). Also, there are no lecture videos provided(except in add-drop period). These force you to attend her lecture and you may feel very tired if you cannot get up early.<br /><br />After midterm, it is Eugene Hung teaching. He is kind to provide you with lecture videos and there is no IPRS, which is good if you really hate 9am class.<br />However, he gives bonus marks to those students answering or asking him questions. If you want to have high marks, please try to attend his lectures as many as you can. Nevertheless, his tone is a little bit boring. It is easy for you to sleep as it is a 9am course. In general, he teaches well and is willing to answer questions.",

Minimal understanding will make you a D if your aim is just to pass this course, and higher grade is achievable by investing time in it.",

Workload was intense despite the lack of assignment, and I spent one week preparing this particular final but still can't get it done. There are too much information to remember.",

The mean is around 35. The final examination is little bit tricky, with 25 Multiple choices questions with single choice, 25 Multiple choices questions with multiple choices. The mean is around 35 as well.",

There is not any assignment besides a so-called &quot;research project&quot; that is actually cancelled in this semester due to insufficient time by Dr HUNG. Originally the project counts 5% towards the course grade. If you wish not to do this project, I recommend you to attend lecture and ask Dr HUNG many questions so that he over-ran and forced to cancel the assignment (lol)",

            "comment_content": "I am a mainland who studied biology in high school. This is the most important reason that I have the courage to enroll this course. Honestly speaking, things I learned in high school cover 90% of LIFS1901, and the rest 10% knowledge is complementary and useful and easy to digest if you study carefully. Generally, this course will truly introduce you to biology from micro to macro. I think it can arouse one's interest in nature to some extent. Well, of course, it depends on the instructor.",
            "comment_teaching": "I have to say that these two instructors are like the opposite. The former (before midterm) just told the content of ppt, even faster than you could read. The atmosphere was always silent and weird, and the instructor sometimes laughed for something only she herself thought funny. The latter was quite good in comparison (I am not saying she is&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> good, just in comparison).She extended the content more and printed the clicker questions in the ppt and even ended the class earlier than expected if everything in the ppt has been taught.",
            "comment_grading": "Just like what I said in the column of &quot;content&quot;, high-school knowledge helps a lot. If you are a mainland and learn no bad in biology, come on! If you are not, please refer to other students' comments about this course. There are over 200 students in my class, but the competition is not that exciting and the high-grade owners are basically mainlands and internationals. According to the grade distribution of midterm, almost half of the students cannot pass(get 60% grades). I got A by the way.",
            "comment_workload": "For me, the main workload lies in reciting and remembering the huge amount of vocabulary. By my estimation, there are more than 400 new words. But don't be afraid, you will get familiar with them in the progress of studying. It only takes my time before midterm and final. But if you are a true beginner in biology, well, take care and good luck. You will get a sense of satisfaction and achievement after the whole semester. After all, I prefer to call it LANG1901.",
