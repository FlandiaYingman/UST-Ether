It consists of the following parts:<br />1. tell you how to become an effective learner.<br />2. teach you how to deliver a speech in the university and how to do group discussion<br />3. teach you how to write an academic essay<br />After I learned all these things, of course, I attended class every time, I found that I did not learn anything really useful for me. Our instructor pointed out our problems, but he did not really tell us how to solve them to improve our English level.",
            "comment_teaching": "To be honest, I just want to say that this course it's not very interesting. Our instructor let us discuss the questions he asked. And that's almost all the content of this boring course. Except these, he just read the sildes. And he also stressed that the grade was not an important thing.",
            "comment_grading": "Really unfair grading system. I just wanted to say that your performance is unrelated to the final grade. Now let me tell a funny story of this ridiculous grading process. I got the final grade first. But the grade for each assignments were not given. So where the final grade came from? I don't know. Maybe the final grade was given by god. I sent an e-mail to my instructor to ask him to offer us the grade for each part. And it was really 'fortunate' that the most important part(writing an academic essay, which weighs most in the grading part) was given the lowest grade, and other parts were given the highest grade. So you know what I mean? I suspected that the grade was given disorderly, I even suspected that he did not truly see our assignments. And I asked lots of classmates in our class, I did not even find one's grade was in b range. We attended every time and submitted every assignment on time. We do them really carefully and prepare lots of for it. At last, we were all given C even D. The CLE system doesn't compare you with your classmates but with other students taught by other teachers. So some students in other class who not submitted their homework on time and do even not take attendance every time got a B or even an A letter at last. That's all about this unfair course. Your effort is really meaningless, a good instructor matters more.",

            "comment_grading": "Bad grade!<br />Unfair grading system!<br />It is a grade killer!<br />Every teacher has their own criteria to judge your grades of assignments and record your grades in the CLE system. After the whole semester, I guess your final grade is decided by the recorded results updated by each teacher.<br />I have put effort into the course and finished every assignment carefully. However, I only get exponential in reflective tasks which don't matter in the whole grade. In other assignments, my scores are almost competent, (writing task is advanced/competent), but my last grade is C+, besides, I can't see any grade above B among my classmates, that's quite unfair. In my opinion, the CLE doesn't care whether your scores are good or bad in the class, it just uses the results given by teachers to 拉curve. <br />The CLE system doesn't compare you with your classmates but with other students taught by other teachers. That results in the situation that one doesn't work hard but his/her teacher encourages him/her and gives a grade like advanced/exponential when he/she makes improvements during the semester. However, some unlucky students may be taught by a strict teacher, and the teacher seldom gives good grades like 'advanced' in assignments which accounts for a high proportion of grades. <br />Even he works hard, he wouldn't get a good grades he expected. At last, the class is not worth working hard for. If you have a strict teacher, the CLE system will give you an unfair grade eventually.",
            "comment_workload": "The class is not worth working hard for!<br />Before class, you are required to do something. There are 5 assignments to be updated during the whole semester. Each will cost you a lot of time if you want to grade a good in the class. 2 electives are also required to be done. But, at last, it doesn't matter whether you do your homework, because the grades are mostly decided by the assignments. The CLE is an idiot, unfair and stupid system. If your 5 assignments get good scores, others won't influence your grade, (or maybe you will get a subgrade). I'm very angry since all my efforts only contribute to a C+. All mistakes are caused by the stupid system!",

I don’t think a very well-developed english background is required, as long as you can follow the teacher, and it will be fine;) <br /><br />Academic Writing Tasks<br />AWT1 ~5%<br />AWT2~30%<br /><br />Academic Speaking Tasks <br />AST1~25%<br />AST2~20%<br /><br />Reflective Tasks <br />RT1~5%<br />RT2~5%<br /><br />Self-directed Learning Tasks ~10% based on completion only",

I found breaking them into smaller tasks and finishing them little by little helps.",

Topics include:<br />Unit 1: Course introduction, methodology for English learning, paragraph development, language style.<br />Unit 2: Discussion under an academic context. Listening, participating, and speaking skills.<br />Unit 3: Coherence and substance in speaking and writing. Developing perspectives, summarising, and paraphrasing. Skills for short speeches. <br /><br />Students need to finish 2 out of 4 electives. Topics include vocabulary accumulation, paragraph development, confidence for speaking. Most of them are easy quizzes or videos. A few may require you to meet an iLANG advisor at the language centre. <br /><br />There are some SDLs (Self-directed learning), including discussing with classmates and uploading the video, summarising perspectives for your chosen topic (about future, which you will use throughout the course), etc. Some of them may appear to be a little bit trivial and time-consuming at first, but many turn out to be very useful for the graded assessments. <br /><br />But I have to say the content of this class is sometimes too general and methodological. Many of the class discussions are boring because Year 1 students are forced to discuss the significance of many theories and notions. Many of the examples for discussions are obstruse and not so illustrative. Maybe they can introduce things more implicitly and include more practical examples.",
            "comment_teaching": "Fiona is an approachable and easy-going instructor. Although she said she is not known as a lenient figure in her first class and frightened us a little bit, she is actually kind and patient.

She is willing to help students after class and she always includes her experiences in the discussion, which makes the classes more engaging.",
            "comment_grading": "There are no exams in this course, so the grading is completely based on assignments and class performances. The grading scheme may differ from class to class, but it basically includes:<br />1. 6 assessment: a) Academic Writing Task 1 - Paragraph on the Future - 5% of course grade (Week 6); b) Academic Speaking Task 1 - Discussion Skills Assessment - 25% of course grade (Week 7), c) Academic Writing Task 2 - Summarising Different Perspectives -Short Essay - 30% of course grade (End of semester), d) Academic Speaking Task 2 - Summarising Different Perspectives -Short Speech - 20% of course grade (End of semester); e) Reflective Task 1 - Talking head video submission - 5% of course grade (Week 9); f) Reflective Task 2 - Written submission - 5% of course grade (End of semester). <br />You can and are suggested to use your chosen topic about future for all these assignments. It reduces your pressure for researching and give you more freedom for the content. The first speaking assessment is in a f2f mode. There is a monologue and a group discussion. The second speaking and first reflective task ask you to submit a video. <br />2. Self-directed learning (SDL) - 10% of course grade (Throughout semester). Electives included. These are only graded for participation, so people should get full mark if they participate and hand in things on time. <br />3. Attendance. Its is said that attendance counts for some grades in other classes. In our class, it is taken but does not contribute to grading.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Assignments are graded into five levels. Getting exceptional and advanced in most assignments should ensure people an A range grade. Most students in the class have moderate English abilities and are not like fluent, imposing native speakers. So, time devotion, expansive research and careful editing should help to get better grades.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not too big, considering all the assessments are scattered to the entire semester and people can work on the same topic. Starting early is highly recommended, as you don’t want to work on the assignments during your precious final weeks. It also gives people more time for editing and proof reading.",
