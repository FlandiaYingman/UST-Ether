        "description": "Big History as an emerging interdisciplinary framework, provides a long term perspective to see the world through reconstructing the history from the big bang all the way to the present. In such a longer time scale, overview of stars, planetary and species evolution, as well as concepts in climate change and how it is related to sustainability of the planet's environment for its current inhabitants, including humanity, will be discussed. The physical science basis, impacts, risk, mitigation and adaptation measures of climate change will also be investigated (including technical and social solutions). For local and regional vulnerabilities, such as extreme weather events, sea-levels rise, storm surge and coastal flooding, will be covered. The significance of collective learning under the big history framework, both as a driver for our exponentially growing impacts, as well as for better solutions, will be highlighted.",

Professor finally accepted our opinions and reduced some workload of the course.<br /><br />✅ Professor uploaded all lecture notes, videos, references to a Dropbox for self-learning. Therefore, you can complete this course without attending the lectures except for IPRS session. <br /><br />✅ Professor arranged group discussions during class time, which allow us to brainstorm our ideas for essays with our group members. <br /><br />❌ Unfortunately, the professor spoke too slow, which make his presentation monotonous and unattractive. I prefer watching lecture videos at 2.0x speed. <br /><br />❌ Due to time limitations, professor skipped many slides and let us read by ourselves.

            "comment_workload": "The workload of this course was high for a common core course. Besides IPRS and midterm, we need to write two essays. Although the number of words were not specified, it is recommended to have sufficient elaboration and explore in details to get a good score. I wrote more than 4000 words for each essay. Moreover, there was poster making for a group. Formerly in typical face-to-face lectures, there will be a poster display in Atrium. As it switched to the online course, I thought making a poster is unnecessary. I would say the workload is substantial in addition to midterm and IPRS.",
