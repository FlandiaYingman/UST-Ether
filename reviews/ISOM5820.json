        "description": "Students shall study 12 applications in OM that  have been judged by peers as being amongst the best in recent years. They will try to understand what the problem was, how it was addressed, how it worked out and attempt to learn what marked it as a success and how portable the practice can be. The principal purpose is to expose students to a wide range of good case histories in order to enhance their repertoire and experience in OM.",
