According to the industrial center website, the safety training should be conducted in year 2 winter, but it was mysteriously postponed to year 2 summer, and without any announcements. At that moment, I was wondering if I was missing something that I've realized that. <br /><br />For the ICU328 module, the case was even worse. Originally it should be taken in year 2 summer. However, a sudden announcement was made when the spring final exam was half way done. The module was postponed to year 3 winter. It was too late to find any other part time jobs or internships for the summer period. Right before the year 3 winter starts, while everyone was thinking the 328 could be finished in that one month's time, one more announcement was made 1 day before the training starts. Two of the training days were changed to right before the spring term starts! For me it was reluctantly fine, but for those who planning to have other activities in the winter term, it was definitely a hell. Everything happened without any reason. I am wondering if there are adequate communications between polyu and HKUST IC. But as a student, such type of arrangement is totally unadaptable.",
