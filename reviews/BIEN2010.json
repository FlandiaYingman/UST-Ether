        "description": "This course is designed as an introductory course in biomedical engineering. The aim of this course is to present some of the basic science and human physiology knowledge used by biomedical engineers and illustrates the first steps in applying this knowledge to solve problems in human medicine. The second goal of this course is to link knowledge of basic science and engineering to fields of specialization and current research. This course also introduces the sub-specialties in biomedical engineering and through real-life examples to emphasize the types of problems biomedical engineers solve.",

It is simple as it talks about kidney functions and heartbeat etc. But it is really hard to understand those formulae and how to apply. No example to explain those formulae in the powerpoint and no detailed explaination in the lesson either.",

She only explain the hw very briefly and quickly in an extra tutorial lesson apart from normal lectures.<br /><br />Apart from the lectures, you need to use wikispace for doing the project. Although it does offer you a compulsory workshop to learn how to use this shit, it is not user-friendly. Not easy to use at all. I nearly send email to ask the TA every single question like how to check my title, how to watch other projects etc. Luckily the TA is very patient to answer my idiot questions.",

It takes you hours to finish and still you may not know how to solve.<br />A project that need to choose topic reference but I was offered to a topic that I do not have any interest&nbsp;&nbsp;in it so I did it so hea. Moreover, I have a friend who missed the project deadline which do not have marks deducted and I think this is really unfair. Nevertheless, if you score high in the project, you will be invited to give a presentation to the class.<br />Mid-term exam is a close-book exam and if study hardworkingly, you will get a good mark.<br />Final exam is a nightmare. Although it is an open-book exam, you will use too much time in finding notes and do not have enough time for finishing the whole paper. Even if you know how to calculate in Chau's homework, you won't know how to calculate the super hard questions in the exam. I remember I can only answer the content related to Bio but nothing about the formulae part.",

Bernoulli's Equations? Fick's Law? XXX Flow......?<br /><br />I am so sorry that I am too stupid to understand these. Maybe some dudes may find them interesting and easy to get the hang of them.<br /><br />Well, I don't try to slander this course and discourage every junior undergraduate from registering it, but what I want to say is, think THRICE, NOT just twice, if you plan to register this course to fulfill Common Core's S&amp;T requirement.",
