            "comment_content": "For most 2000 level MATH course, there are two (or more) version of the same course. For example, MATH 2011/2023, MATH 2111/2121 and MATH 2351/2352. One of the two is introduced more rigorous than the other. However, the probability introduction course seems to be missing.... No! It went to the IEDA department. :D<br /><br />This course is a non-rigorous introduction to probability. This course focuses on the computation and coding, and almost no proofs are covered in the course. The concepts are mostly introduced informally, even basic set theory knowledge is not required.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />I. Descriptive Statistics<br />II. Elements of Probability (basic definitions)<br />III. Random Variables (discrete, continuous, joint distributions)<br />IV. Limiting Theorems (law of large numbers, CLT)<br /><br />Also, there are about three python tutorials for basic scipy packages and graph plotting.",
            "comment_teaching": "The prof. introduces the concepts clearly with explanations. You can see markings flying around his slides. He teaches pretty slow that most students can catch up easily. There is even no prerequisites needed like high school probability. In my perspective, it is sometimes quite boring as he spent too much time on trivial concepts (although it is good he does that).",
            "comment_grading": "You won't get such a good grade if you perform equally well in a MATH course. The top students from MATH courses are missing so the curve is pulled up nicely. Most of the problems in exams are easy (but a few of them is annoying) so being careful is quite important. <br /><br />Score statistics (and my score):<br />Midterm 1 (15%): 98/100 (Mean: 69, SD: 15.9, Max: 98)<br />Midterm 2 (25%): 98/100 (Mean: 68.82, SD: 18.97, Max: 98)<br />Final exam (45%): 87/100 (Mean: 63.6, SD: not released, Max: 95)<br />Homework (15%): 39.5/40<br />Overall: 93.1625% -&gt; A+<br /><br />Attached are score distributions of both midterms.",
            "comment_workload": "The overall workload of the course is quite light considering the amount of homework and the preparation work for the exams.<br /><br />Exams:<br />To be honest, I did not revise much for the two midterms. Most of the materials are DSE level and you do not need to pay too much effort. So, there is very little workload in the middle of the term. On the other hand, you should spend some time preparing for the exam. Writing a good cheatsheet would help you apply the formula faster, and clearing up your concepts meanwhile. You have to be crystal clear about the concepts of correlation and independence, or else you might get them wrong easily.<br /><br />Homework:<br />Although there are 8 assignments, we only have to submit 4 of them. They would not take you a lot of time.<br /><br />Lecture/tutorial:<br />Attendance is not mandatory for both lectures and tutorial. My suggestion is to skip the tutorials and find extra materials online/ from a textbook.",

            "comment_content": "The exact contents are the same as the reviews below, so I won't list the subtopics and talk about my thoughts instead. <br /><br />Python Basics<br />Quite useful python coding (basic operations, importing packets like matplotlib, pandas etc.) Good starting point for learning data analysis.<br /><br />Module 1 - Descriptive Statistics<br />Mostly high school stuff, talks about how to describe data with various charts (which to use in each case). Most of this content doesn't get tested in the end, the only new and useful thing I learned in this module is the Chebyshev's inequality.<br /><br />Module 2 - Elements of Probability<br />I took M1 in high school so this was all easy M1 stuff (disclaimer: my M1 isn't that good either), but this module should be easy for those who have no background as well. Just basic multiplying and dividing most of the time, some annoying counting but nothing ridiculously hard.<br /><br />Module 3a - Random Variables (Discrete)<br />Pmf, cdf of discrete random variables (basically Poisson, Bernoulli and Binomial), not too hard since it's just summation, no calculus. <br /><br />Module 3b - Random Variables (Continuous)<br />Pdf, cdf of continuous distributions (exponential, standard normal etc.), this is where things start to get a bit hard and confusing since there is calculus involved. In my opinion, still manageable with reasonable effort.<br /><br />Module 3c - Joint Distribution<br />Joint distribution and conditional distribution/expectation with multiple (mainly 2) variables. This module gets ridiculously difficult especially if you have no multivariable calculus background (which I believe is the case for most year 2 IEDA students in Fall sem). The basic examples covered in class are easy to understand and helpful, but the homework and exam questions are a whole different level. <br /><br />Module 4 - Limiting Theorems<br />This part seems easy compared to 3c. Should be fine once you understand the applications of law of large numbers and central limit theorem.<br /><br />I enjoyed the content, it was useful and quite challenging.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Zhang Jiheng is good at teaching. He has the exceptional talent of making complex concepts sound more friendly and understandable. I appreciate that he never over-complicated stuff and tailored the course to beginners with little to no background.<br /><br />He prepares useful examples in class and really makes us understand the point of learning all this content (applications in different industries and later IEDA courses). He sounds like he genuinely believes in the stuff he teaches and backs it up with actual knowledge and examples. He teaches with heart and you can tell he really cares.<br /><br />He is also very nice to the students (even to those who challenge him in class. Yes, it actually happened.) He replies to all emails as much as he can and sometimes gives hints for the homework. <br /><br />Most importantly, it is evident that he pays attention to students' opinions and actually makes appropriate responses. For example, a student criticised him on Canvas for setting midterm questions that could be easily googled. In the final, he set very unique and difficult questions with niche notations and published the paper in .jpg format (don't know if this has to do with the incident, but undeniably it worked).<br /><br />He teaches the simple examples of multivariable calculus very well - he helps us visualize by drawing graphs and using different colours. He explains them so well that you're tricked into thinking you can handle those problems - and then you look at the homework and exam questions then you realize you don't even know how to start. Sometimes I wished he could have gone over some more difficult examples in class as well.",

I was quite surprised at the grade.",

The lectures only cover the concepts rather lightly and the homework is nearly nonexistent for this course so you'll have to do more practice problems on the side to really build an understanding. If you can consistently put in a couple hours of work each week into doing practice, you can probably attain a good grade. Watching youtube videos also helped me immensely for this course as it helped me tie all the concepts together.",

The lectures only cover the concepts rather lightly and the homework is nearly nonexistent for this course so you'll have to do more practice problems on the side to really build an understanding.
