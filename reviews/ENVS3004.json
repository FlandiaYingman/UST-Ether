This course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in physical climate system, with which to understand global warming, natural climate variations and climate models. We will also consider regional climate anomalies, unusual sequences of recent climate change, impacts of climate change in ecosystems and technologies to slow and stabilize climate change.",

I got &gt;1 SD above mean in the midterm and final, close to the highest score in both exams. Above mean in the report, slightly below mean in presentation. Even with 0% in class participation, it should be at least A- grade. Unless they give A-range grade to only 2 or 3 out of 40 students.<br /><br />Ridiculous grade distribution. In any other course, or if I did this same course with same exam scores at any other university, I would get A- or A for sure.",

There is a 10-minute presentation and 5-page report. That takes up a lot of time during the last 2-3 weeks of the semester, just for 20% of the final grade in this course. <br /><br />The project should be optional for an extra bonus grade, as a lot of students are year 3 or year 4, it's too much workload with FYP, etc.<br /><br />Attendance 5% is also very unnecessary, for a 9:00 am course.",
