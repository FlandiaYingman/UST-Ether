        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other data analytics tools have been advanced dramatically in recent years. In particular, some of these technologies are conducting many cognitive tasks that only humans could do before, such as prediction, evaluation, and decision making. It is widely believed that they will fundamentally transform many business practices. This course provides students with the necessary technical and managerial backgrounds to become leaders in the AI-transformed economy. In the first module, we discuss what AI technologies are, and how AI is creating value by enhancing efficiency and reducing (some) bias in humans. In the second and third modules, we cover AI applications across functions, such as hiring, investment, and innovation, to understand how firms and governments can use AI to enhance their operations. The fourth module introduces challenges that organizations face in implementing AI, and what actions they can take; In the final module considers how students should design their careers to remain competitive in the future.",
