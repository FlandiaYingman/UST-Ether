It was aimed at covering operations management in financial industry, but unfortunately nothing concrete was discussed in the course (the common core intro to financial market by Prof. Veronique is much better). Attending lectures is a waste of time, and ironically is mandatory. A lot of the materials are severely out of date.",
            "comment_teaching": "With all due respect, the prof's teaching is not good, perhaps one of the worst in UST. Around half of the time in each lecture was bullsh*t. Prof often referred to wrong &quot;facts&quot;. The course materials are not well structured, and very messy.",
