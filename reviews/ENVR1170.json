        "description": "A scientific narrative of the evolution of the universe from the Big Bang all the way to the present (also known as Big History) will be introduced in this course. The course outlines how scientific methods can be used to understand the evolution of the physical, biological and social environment around us. It highlights the transdisciplinary nature of scientific knowledge, the importance of collaboration and self-critical claim testing, the accumulation of knowledge, the acceleration of technology all the way to Big Data and AI, and finally the social and environmental challenges posed by these changes. Climate change will be used as a detailed example of a complex environment and sustainability challenges in the 21st century.  Students will be guided to appreciate how collaborations and system-thinking with integration and sharing of concepts across disciplines are required for addressing these challenges.",

The major focus on this big history course is the comparison of timescales, major events and the significance of human. It allow us to rethink our power and what we should do in the present to maintain sustainable development.<br /><br />The topic on collective learning feels like social science lectures, he placed much focus on the human &amp; agriculture part.<br />All in all, the contents are really abstract but it is fairly easy to memorise through lectures and videos",

The annoying part is in the lecture is that there will be PRS quizzes (12 times during the entire term) randomly so you have little chance to skip lessons. <br />In the middle of the term you will join in 2 class forums where you discuss with groups of 4 on projects and write two short essays submitted 2 weeks after the forum.<br />One time the prof. hint the next lesson will have no quiz.

The midterm consist of MC and T/F questions, most of them comes from PRS questions, therefore must attend lessons!!! <br />The group project is the bias one as the score depends on certain rules on designing it. This limited the poster creativity. I even argue with the TA for remarking, but that asshole lack a sense of art appreciation and it is a waste of time to talk to him.<br />The asshole TA is Wai xxx Wong Aiden",

Sustainability issues are also okay as it relates the effect of climate change into different aspects like economy and society. He introduced &quot;Collapse&quot; from Jared Diamond, mainly about why society would collapse and it's easy to get too.<br /><br />Lastly, the big history part. I think this part is the most interesting part because we can know how human develop into the current state through collective learning, social systems, interests and empire and the importance of money.",
            "comment_teaching": "He speaks very slowly, when I watch the lecture videos, I speed it up to 2x. He emphasised a lot this course isn't about teaching you climate change or anything fancy as they can be found on the Internet easily, but there's something he wants us to take is the willingness to change and realise that we can still do a lot for our planets and humans. <br /><br />However, his lectures are quite boring and many people fall asleep.",

I would say the topics for the two essays are similar so I don't really know what else to add on in the second essay. <br /><br />Essay one is given a lot of time to finish as the professor keeps postponing the deadline. But essay two we have to hand in before final period so it took up a lot of my study time (if you don't start early)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Midterm is only Mcs and TF questions.",
