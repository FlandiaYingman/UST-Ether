        "description": "This course is a mixture of lecture, readings, and student project focused on environmental challenges in smart cities, particularly the ones related to energy, water and climate. Mathematical and physical laws and concepts that are fundamental to urban science will be introduced. Lectures will cover grand challenges associated with urban development in the 21st century and their potential engineering solutions. The students will then perform a final research project on a topic of their interest, related to smart cities, with the aim of understanding the current trend of science and technology.",
