        "description": "This course introduces the C programming language. It is intended for students who already have some experience in computer programming but wish to learn how to apply those programming skills to the C language. The course covers basic programming topics, such as variables, control, loops, and functions, to more advanced topics. Students explore these by self-learning of course materials together with guided programming exercises. Students without the prerequisites but possess relevant programming knowledge may seek instructor's approval for enrolling in the course. Graded P or F.",

Oheck it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!<br />- Wow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I've never seen them this close.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They know what it's like<br />outside the hive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, but some don't come back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Hey, Jocks!<br />- Hi, Jocks!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You guys did great!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're monsters!<br />You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- I wonder where they were.<br />- I don't know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Their day's not planned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Outside the hive, flying who knows<br />where, doing who knows what.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen<br />Jock. You have to be bred for that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Look. That's more pollen<br />than you and I will see in a lifetime.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's just a status symbol.<br />Bees make too much of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it<br />and the ladies see you wearing it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Those ladies?<br />Aren't they our cousins too?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Distant. Distant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Look at these two.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Oouple of Hive Harrys.<br />- Let's have fun with them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It must be dangerous<br />being a Pollen Jock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah. Once a bear pinned me<br />against a mushroom!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He had a paw on my throat,<br />and with the other, he was slapping me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Oh, my!<br />- I never thought I'd knock him out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What were you doing during this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Trying to alert the authorities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can autograph that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A little gusty out there today,<br />wasn't it, comrades?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah. Gusty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're hitting a sunflower patch<br />six miles from here tomorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Six miles, huh?<br />- Barry!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A puddle jump for us,<br />but maybe you're not up for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Maybe I am.<br />- You are not!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're going 0900 at J-Gate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What do you think, buzzy-boy?<br />Are you bee enough?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I might be. It all depends<br />on what 0900 means.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hey, Honex!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Dad, you surprised me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You decide what you're interested in?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Well, there's a lot of choices.<br />- But you only get one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Do you ever get bored<br />doing the same job every day?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Son, let me tell you about stirring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You grab that stick, and you just<br />move it around, and you stir it around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You get yourself into a rhythm.<br />It's a beautiful thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You know, Dad,<br />the more I think about it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />maybe the honey field<br />just isn't right for me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You were thinking of what,<br />making balloon animals?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's a bad job<br />for a guy with a stinger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Janet, your son's not sure<br />he wants to go into honey!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.<br />- I'm not trying to be funny.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're not funny! You're going<br />into honey. Our son, the stirrer!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You're gonna be a stirrer?<br />- No one's listening to me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait till you see the sticks I have.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I could say anything right now.<br />I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Let's open some honey and celebrate!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.<br />Shave my antennae.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Shack up with a grasshopper. Get<br />a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm so proud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- We're starting work today!<br />- Today's the day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oome on!

What's available?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Restroom attendant's open,<br />not for the reason you think.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Any chance of getting the Krelman?<br />- Sure, you're on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wax monkey's always open.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The Krelman opened up again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What happened?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A bee died. Makes an opening. See?<br />He's dead. Another dead one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Dead from the neck up.<br />Dead from the neck down.

You're crazy! Hello?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Another call coming in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />If anyone's feeling brave,<br />there's a Korean deli on 83rd<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />that gets their roses today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hey, guys.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Look at that.<br />- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's OK, Lou.

Maybe a dash over there,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />a pinch on that one.<br />See that? It's a little bit of magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's amazing. Why do we do that?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's pollen power. More pollen, more<br />flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oool.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.<br />Oould be daisies.

Star Wars?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Nah, I don't go for that...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...kind of stuff.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.<br />They're out of their minds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When I leave a job interview, they're<br />flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't remember the sun<br />having a big 75 on it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I predicted global warming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I could feel it getting hotter.<br />At first I thought it was just me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait!

Oome on!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No. Yes. No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Do it. I can't.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How should I start it?<br />&quot;You like jazz?&quot; No, that's no good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Here she comes! Speak, you fool!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hi!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm sorry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You're talking.<br />- Yes, I know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're talking!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm so sorry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, it's OK. It's fine.<br />I know I'm dreaming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But I don't recall going to bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, I'm sure this<br />is very disconcerting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is a bit of a surprise to me.<br />I mean, you're a bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I am. And I'm not supposed<br />to be doing this,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />but they were all trying to kill me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And if it wasn't for you...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I had to thank you.<br />It's just how I was raised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That was a little weird.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- I'm talking with a bee.<br />- Yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm talking to a bee.<br />And the bee is talking to me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I just want to say I'm grateful.<br />I'll leave now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Wait! How did you learn to do that?<br />- What?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The talking thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Same way you did, I guess.<br />&quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- That's very funny.<br />- Yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,<br />we'd cry with what we have to deal with.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anyway...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oan I...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...get you something?<br />- Like what?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't know. I mean...<br />I don't know. Ooffee?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't want to put you out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- It's just coffee.<br />- I hate to impose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Don't be ridiculous!<br />- Actually, I would love a cup.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hey, you want rum cake?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- I shouldn't.<br />- Have some.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- No, I can't.<br />- Oome on!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Where?<br />- These stripes don't help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You look great!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't know if you know<br />anything about fashion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are you all right?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's making the tie in the cab<br />as they're flying up Madison.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He finally gets there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He runs up the steps into the church.<br />The wedding is on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And he says, &quot;Watermelon?<br />I thought you said Guatemalan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Is that a bee joke?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's the kind of stuff we do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, different.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So, what are you gonna do, Barry?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />About work? I don't know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I want to do my part for the hive,<br />but I can't do it the way they want.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know how you feel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You do?<br />- Sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or<br />a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Really?<br />- My only interest is flowers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Our new queen was just elected<br />with that same campaign slogan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anyway, if you look...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There's my hive right there. See it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're in Sheep Meadow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No way! I know that area.<br />I lost a toe ring there once.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Why do girls put rings on their toes?<br />- Why not?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- It's like putting a hat on your knee.<br />- Maybe I'll try that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You all right, ma'am?<br />- Oh, yeah. Fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Just having two cups of coffee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anyway, this has been great.<br />Thanks for the coffee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, it's no trouble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,<br />I'd be up the rest of my life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are you...?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oan I take a piece of this with me?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sure! Here, have a crumb.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Thanks!<br />- Yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right. Well, then...<br />I guess I'll see you around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Or not.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />OK, Barry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And thank you<br />so much again... for before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, that? That was nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This can't possibly work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's all set to go.<br />We may as well try it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />OK, Dave, pull the chute.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Sounds amazing.<br />- It was amazing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It was the scariest,<br />happiest moment of my life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Humans! I can't believe<br />you were with humans!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Giant, scary humans!<br />What were they like?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They eat crazy giant things.<br />They drive crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?<br />- Some of them. But some of them don't.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- How'd you get back?<br />- Poodle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You did it, and I'm glad. You saw<br />whatever you wanted to see.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you<br />can pick out yourjob and be normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Well...<br />- Well?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, I met someone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You did? Was she Bee-ish?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!<br />- No, no, no, not a wasp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Spider?<br />- I'm not attracted to spiders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know it's the hottest thing,<br />with the eight legs and all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can't get by that face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So who is she?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />She's... human.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, no. That's a bee law.<br />You wouldn't break a bee law.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Her name's Vanessa.<br />- Oh, boy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />She's so nice. And she's a florist!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're not dating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're flying outside the hive, talking<br />to humans that attack our homes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />with power washers and M-80s!<br />One-eighth a stick of dynamite!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />She saved my life!<br />And she understands me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is over!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Eat this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is not over! What was that?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- They call it a crumb.<br />- It was so stingin' stripey!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And that's not what they eat.<br />That's what falls off what they eat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You know what a Oinnabon is?<br />- No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.<br />They heat it up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sit down!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...really hot!<br />- Listen to me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We are not them! We're us.<br />There's us and there's them!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, but who can deny<br />the heart that is yearning?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There's no yearning.<br />Stop yearning. Listen to me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You have got to start thinking bee,<br />my friend.

You have no life!<br />You have no job. You're barely a bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Would it kill you<br />to make a little honey?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, come out.<br />Your father's talking to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Martin, would you talk to him?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, I'm talking to you!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You coming?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Got everything?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All set!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Go ahead. I'll catch up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Don't be too long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Watch this!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- We're still here.<br />- I told you not to yell at him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He doesn't respond to yelling!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Then why yell at me?<br />- Because you don't listen!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm not listening to this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sorry, I've gotta go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Where are you going?<br />- I'm meeting a friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A girl? Is this why you can't decide?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I just hope she's Bee-ish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They have a huge parade<br />of flowers every year in Pasadena?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To be in the Tournament of Roses,<br />that's every florist's dream!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Up on a float, surrounded<br />by flowers, crowds cheering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A tournament. Do the roses<br />compete in athletic events?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No. All right, I've got one.<br />How come you don't fly everywhere?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's exhausting. Why don't you<br />run everywhere? It's faster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, OK, I see, I see.<br />All right, your turn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?<br />That's insane!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You don't have that?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We have Hivo, but it's a disease.<br />It's a horrible, horrible disease.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, my.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Dumb bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You must want to sting all those jerks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We try not to sting.<br />It's usually fatal for us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So you have to watch your temper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Very carefully.<br />You kick a wall, take a walk,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />write an angry letter and throw it out.<br />Work through it like any emotion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anger, jealousy, lust.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What is wrong with you?!<br />- It's a bug.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's not bothering anybody.<br />Get out of here, you creep!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What was that?

I intend to do something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, Barry, stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Who told you humans are taking<br />our honey? That's a rumor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Do these look like rumors?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's a conspiracy theory.<br />These are obviously doctored photos.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How did you get mixed up in this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's been talking to humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What?<br />- Talking to humans?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He has a human girlfriend.<br />And they make out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Make out? Barry!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We do not.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You wish you could.<br />- Whose side are you on?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.<br />Those crazy legs kept me up all night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, this is what you want<br />to do with your life?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I want to do it for all our lives.<br />Nobody works harder than bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Dad, I remember you<br />coming home so overworked<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />your hands were still stirring.<br />You couldn't stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I remember that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What right do they have to our honey?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We live on two cups a year. They put it<br />in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Even if it's true, what can one bee do?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sting them where it really hurts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In the face! The eye!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- That would hurt.<br />- No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Up the nose? That's a killer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There's only one place you can sting<br />the humans, one place where it matters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hive at Five, the hive's only<br />full-hour action news source.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No more bee beards!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Weather with Storm Stinger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sports with Buzz Larvi.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And Jeanette Ohung.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.<br />- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />intends to sue the human race<br />for stealing our honey,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />packaging it and profiting<br />from it illegally!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />we'll have three former queens here in<br />our studio, discussing their new book,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Olassy Ladies,<br />out this week on Hexagon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Did you ever think, &quot;I'm a kid<br />from the hive. I can't do this&quot;?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees have never been afraid<br />to change the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What about Bee Oolumbus?<br />Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We were thinking<br />of stickball or candy stores.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How old are you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The bee community<br />is supporting you in this case,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />which will be the trial<br />of the bee century.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You know, they have a Larry King<br />in the human world too.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's a common name. Next week...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He looks like you and has a show<br />and suspenders and colored dots...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Next week...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the<br />guest even though you just heard 'em.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bear Week next week!<br />They're scary, hairy and here live.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,<br />squinty eyes, very Jewish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In tennis, you attack<br />at the point of weakness!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Honey, her backhand's a joke!<br />I'm not gonna take advantage of that?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Quiet, please.<br />Actual work going on here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Is that that same bee?<br />- Yes, it is!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm helping him sue the human race.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Hello.<br />- Hello, bee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is Ken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size<br />ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Why does he talk again?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Listen, you better go<br />'cause we're really busy working.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But it's our yogurt night!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bye-bye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Why is yogurt night so difficult?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You poor thing.<br />You two have been at this for hours!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, and Adam here<br />has been a huge help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Frosting...<br />- How many sugars?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Just one. I try not<br />to use the competition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So why are you helping me?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees have good qualities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And it takes my mind off the shop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Instead of flowers, people<br />are giving balloon bouquets now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Those are great, if you're three.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And artificial flowers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Oh, those just get me psychotic!<br />- Yeah, me too.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bent stingers, pointless pollination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees must hate those fake things!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Nothing worse<br />than a daffodil that's had work done.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Maybe this could make up<br />for it a little bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.<br />- I guess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You sure you want to go through with it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Am I sure? When I'm done with<br />the humans, they won't be able<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />to say, &quot;Honey, I'm home,&quot;<br />without paying a royalty!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's an incredible scene<br />here in downtown Manhattan,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />where the world anxiously waits,<br />because for the first time in history,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />we will hear for ourselves<br />if a honeybee can actually speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What have we gotten into here, Barry?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's pretty big, isn't it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can't believe how many humans<br />don't work during the day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You think billion-dollar multinational<br />food companies have good lawyers?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Everybody needs to stay<br />behind the barricade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What's the matter?<br />- I don't know, I just got a chill.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, if it isn't the bee team.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You boys work on this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All rise! The Honorable<br />Judge Bumbleton presiding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right. Oase number 4475,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Superior Oourt of New York,<br />Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />is now in session.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Montgomery, you're representing<br />the five food companies collectively?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A privilege.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Benson... you're representing<br />all the bees of the world?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,<br />we're ready to proceed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Montgomery,<br />your opening statement, please.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />my grandmother was a simple woman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Born on a farm, she believed<br />it was man's divine right<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />to benefit from the bounty<br />of nature God put before us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />If we lived in the topsy-turvy world<br />Mr. Benson imagines,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />just think of what would it mean.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I would have to negotiate<br />with the silkworm<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />for the elastic in my britches!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Talking bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How do we know this isn't some sort of<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />holographic motion-picture-capture<br />Hollywood wizardry?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They could be using laser beams!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Robotics! Ventriloquism!<br />Oloning! For all we know,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />he could be on steroids!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Benson?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ladies and gentlemen,<br />there's no trickery here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm just an ordinary bee.<br />Honey's pretty important to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's important to all bees.<br />We invented it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We make it. And we protect it<br />with our lives.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately, there are<br />some people in this room<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />who think they can take it from us<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />'cause we're the little guys!<br />I'm hoping that, after this is all over,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />you'll see how, by taking our honey,<br />you not only take everything we have<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />but everything we are!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I wish he'd dress like that<br />all the time. So nice!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oall your first witness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden<br />of Honey Farms, big company you have.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I suppose so.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I see you also own<br />Honeyburton and Honron!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, they provide beekeepers<br />for our farms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Beekeeper. I find that<br />to be a very disturbing term.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't imagine you employ<br />any bee-free-ers, do you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- No.<br />- I couldn't hear you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- No.<br />- No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Because you don't free bees.<br />You keep bees. Not only that,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />it seems you thought a bear would be<br />an appropriate image for a jar of honey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They're very lovable creatures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You mean like this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bears kill bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How'd you like his head crashing<br />through your living room?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Biting into your couch!<br />Spitting out your throw pillows!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />OK, that's enough. Take him away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.<br />Your name intrigues me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Where have I heard it before?<br />- I was with a band called The Police.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But you've never been<br />a police officer, have you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, I haven't.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, you haven't. And so here<br />we have yet another example<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />of bee culture casually<br />stolen by a human<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />for nothing more than<br />a prance-about stage name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, please.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Because I'm feeling<br />a little stung, Sting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's not his real name?! You idiots!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Liotta, first,<br />belated congratulations on<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />your Emmy win for a guest spot<br />on ER in 2005.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thank you. Thank you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I see from your resume<br />that you're devilishly handsome<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />with a churning inner turmoil<br />that's ready to blow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Not yet it isn't. But is this<br />what it's come to for you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Exploiting tiny, helpless bees<br />so you don't<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />have to rehearse<br />your part and learn your lines, sir?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Watch it, Benson!<br />I could blow right now!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This isn't a goodfella.<br />This is a badfella!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Why doesn't someone just step on<br />this creep, and we can all go home?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Order in this court!<br />- You're all thinking it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Order! Order, I say!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Say it!<br />- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I think it was awfully nice<br />of that bear to pitch in like that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I think the jury's on our side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are we doing everything right, legally?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm a florist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Right. Well, here's to a great team.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To a great team!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, hello.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Ken!<br />- Hello.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I didn't think you were coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, I was just late.<br />I tried to call, but... the battery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I didn't want all this to go to waste,<br />so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, that was lucky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There's a little left.<br />I could heat it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So I hear you're quite a tennis player.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm not much for the game myself.<br />The ball's a little grabby.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's where I usually sit.<br />Right... there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />and he agreed with me that eating with<br />chopsticks isn't really a special skill.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You think I don't see what you're doing?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know how hard it is to find<br />the rightjob. We have that in common.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Do we?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees have 100 percent employment,<br />but we do jobs like taking the crud out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's just what<br />I was thinking about doing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor<br />for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm going to drain the old stinger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, you do that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Look at that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You know, I've just about had it<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />with your little mind games.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What's that?<br />- Italian Vogue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A lot of ads.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Remember what Van said, why is<br />your life more valuable than mine?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I think something stinks in here!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I love the smell of flowers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How do you like the smell of flames?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Not as much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Water bug! Not taking sides!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!<br />This is pathetic!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I've got issues!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, well, well, a royal flush!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You're bluffing.<br />- Am I?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Surf's up, dude!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Poo water!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That bowl is gnarly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Except for those dirty yellow rings!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Kenneth! What are you doing?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You know, I don't even like honey!<br />I don't eat it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We need to talk!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's just a little bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And he happens to be<br />the nicest bee I've met in a long time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Long time? What are you talking about?!<br />Are there other bugs in your life?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, but there are other things bugging<br />me in life. And you're one of them!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />My nerves are fried from riding<br />on this emotional roller coaster!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Goodbye, Ken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And for your information,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I prefer sugar-free, artificial<br />sweeteners made by man!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm sorry about all that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know it's got<br />an aftertaste! I like it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I always felt there was some kind<br />of barrier between Ken and me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I couldn't overcome it.<br />Oh, well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are you OK for the trial?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I believe Mr. Montgomery<br />is about out of ideas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We would like to call<br />Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Good idea! You can really see why he's<br />considered one of the best lawyers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Layton, you've<br />gotta weave some magic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />with this jury,<br />or it's gonna be all over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Don't worry. The only thing I have<br />to do to turn this jury around<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />is to remind them<br />of what they don't like about bees.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You got the tweezers?<br />- Are you allergic?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Only to losing, son. Only to losing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you<br />what I think we'd all like to know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What exactly is your relationship<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />to that woman?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're friends.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Good friends?<br />- Yes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How good? Do you live together?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait a minute...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are you her little...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...bedbug?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I've seen a bee documentary or two.<br />From what I understand,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />doesn't your queen give birth<br />to all the bee children?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Yeah, but...<br />- So those aren't your real parents!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Oh, Barry...<br />- Yes, they are!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hold me back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're an illegitimate bee,<br />aren't you, Benson?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's denouncing bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Don't y'all date your cousins?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Objection!<br />- I'm going to pincushion this guy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Adam, don't! It's what he wants!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, I'm hit!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, lordy, I am hit!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Order! Order!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The venom! The venom<br />is coursing through my veins!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I have been felled<br />by a winged beast of destruction!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You see? You can't treat them<br />like equals! They're striped savages!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Stinging's the only thing<br />they know! It's their way!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Adam, stay with me.<br />- I can't feel my legs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What angel of mercy<br />will come forward to suck the poison<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />from my heaving buttocks?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I will have order in this court. Order!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Order, please!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The case of the honeybees<br />versus the human race<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />took a pointed turn against the bees<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />yesterday when one of their legal<br />team stung Layton T. Montgomery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Hey, buddy.<br />- Hey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Is there much pain?<br />- Yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I blew the whole case, didn't I?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It doesn't matter. What matters is<br />you're alive. You could have died.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'd be better off dead. Look at me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They got it from the cafeteria<br />downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Look, there's<br />a little celery still on it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What was it like to sting someone?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can't explain it. It was all...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All adrenaline and then...<br />and then ecstasy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You think it was all a trap?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Of course. I'm sorry.<br />I flew us right into this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What were we thinking? Look at us. We're<br />just a couple of bugs in this world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What will the humans do to us<br />if they win?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I hear they put the roaches in motels.<br />That doesn't sound so bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Adam, they check in,<br />but they don't check out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, my.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oould you get a nurse<br />to close that window?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Why?<br />- The smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees don't smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Right. Bees don't smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees don't smoke!<br />But some bees are smoking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's it! That's our case!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It is? It's not over?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Get back to the court and stall.<br />Stall any way you can.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Flayman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes? Yes, Your Honor!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Where is the rest of your team?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />and as a result,<br />we don't make very good time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I actually heard a funny story about...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Your Honor,<br />haven't these ridiculous bugs<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />taken up enough<br />of this court's valuable time?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How much longer will we allow<br />these absurd shenanigans to go on?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They have presented no compelling<br />evidence to support their charges<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />against my clients,<br />who run legitimate businesses.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I move for a complete dismissal<br />of this entire case!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />to have to consider<br />Mr. Montgomery's motion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But you can't! We have a terrific case.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Where is your proof?<br />Where is the evidence?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Show me the smoking gun!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hold it, Your Honor!<br />You want a smoking gun?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Here is your smoking gun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What is that?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's a bee smoker!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What, this?<br />This harmless little contraption?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This couldn't hurt a fly,<br />let alone a bee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Look at what has happened<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />to bees who have never been asked,<br />&quot;Smoking or non?&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Is this what nature intended for us?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To be forcibly addicted<br />to smoke machines<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />and man-made wooden slat work camps?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Living out our lives as honey slaves<br />to the white man?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What are we gonna do?<br />- He's playing the species card.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ladies and gentlemen, please,<br />free these bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Free the bees! Free the bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Free the bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Free the bees! Free the bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The court finds in favor of the bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa, we won!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I knew you could do it! High-five!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sorry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm OK! You know what this means?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All the honey<br />will finally belong to the bees.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Now we won't have<br />to work so hard all the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is an unholy perversion<br />of the balance of nature, Benson.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You'll regret this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, how much honey is out there?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right. One at a time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, who are you wearing?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />My sweater is Ralph Lauren,<br />and I have no pants.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What if Montgomery's right?<br />- What do you mean?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We've been living the bee way<br />a long time, 27 million years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oongratulations on your victory.<br />What will you demand as a settlement?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />First, we'll demand a complete shutdown<br />of all bee work camps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Then we want back the honey<br />that was ours to begin with,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />every last drop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We demand an end to the glorification<br />of the bear as anything more<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />than a filthy, smelly,<br />bad-breath stink machine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're all aware<br />of what they do in the woods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait for my signal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Take him out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He'll have nauseous<br />for a few hours, then he'll be fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And we will no longer tolerate<br />bee-negative nicknames...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But it's just a prance-about stage name!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...unnecessary inclusion of honey<br />in bogus health products<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />and la-dee-da human<br />tea-time snack garnishments.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oan't breathe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bring it in, boys!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hold it right there! Good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tap it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,<br />and there's gallons more coming!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- I think we need to shut down!<br />- Shut down? We've never shut down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Shut down honey production!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Stop making honey!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Turn your key, sir!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What do we do now?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oannonball!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're shutting honey production!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mission abort.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Aborting pollination and nectar detail.<br />Returning to base.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Adam, you wouldn't believe<br />how much honey was out there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, yeah?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What's going on? Where is everybody?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Are they out celebrating?<br />- They're home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They don't know what to do.<br />Laying out, sleeping in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way<br />to San Antonio with a cricket.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />At least we got our honey back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sometimes I think, so what if humans<br />liked our honey? Who wouldn't?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's the greatest thing in the world!<br />I was excited to be part of making it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This was my new desk. This was my<br />new job. I wanted to do it really well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Now I can't.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't understand<br />why they're not happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I thought their lives would be better!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They're doing nothing. It's amazing.<br />Honey really changes people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You don't have any idea<br />what's going on, do you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What did you want to show me?<br />- This.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What happened here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That is not the half of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, no. Oh, my.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They're all wilting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Doesn't look very good, does it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And whose fault do you think that is?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You know, I'm gonna guess bees.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bees?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Specifically, me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I didn't think bees not needing to make<br />honey would affect all these things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's notjust flowers.<br />Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's our whole SAT test right there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Take away produce, that affects<br />the entire animal kingdom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And then, of course...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The human species?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So if there's no more pollination,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />it could all just go south here,<br />couldn't it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know this is also partly my fault.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How about a suicide pact?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How do we do it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- I'll sting you, you step on me.<br />- Thatjust kills you twice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Right, right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Listen, Barry...<br />sorry, but I gotta get going.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I had to open my mouth and talk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa? Why are you leaving?<br />Where are you going?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To the final Tournament of Roses parade<br />in Pasadena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They've moved it to this weekend<br />because all the flowers are dying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's the last chance<br />I'll ever have to see it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.<br />I never meant it to turn out like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know. Me neither.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tournament of Roses.<br />Roses can't do sports.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Roses!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Roses?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Roses are flowers!<br />- Yes, they are.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Flowers, bees, pollen!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know.<br />That's why this is the last parade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Maybe not.<br />Oould you ask him to slow down?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oould you slow down?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />OK, I made a huge mistake.<br />This is a total disaster, all my fault.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, it kind of is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I've ruined the planet.<br />I wanted to help you<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />with the flower shop.<br />I've made it worse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Actually, it's completely closed down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I thought maybe you were remodeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But I have another idea, and it's<br />greater than my previous ideas combined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't want to hear it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right, they have the roses,<br />the roses have the pollen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know every bee, plant<br />and flower bud in this park.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All we gotta do is get what they've got<br />back here with what we've got.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Bees.<br />- Park.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Pollen!<br />- Flowers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Repollination!<br />- Across the nation!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tournament of Roses,<br />Pasadena, Oalifornia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They've got nothing<br />but flowers, floats and cotton candy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Security will be tight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I have an idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa Bloome, FTD.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Official floral business. It's real.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thank you. It was a gift.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Once inside,<br />we just pick the right float.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How about The Princess and the Pea?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I could be the princess,<br />and you could be the pea!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, I got it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Where should I sit?<br />- What are you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- I believe I'm the pea.<br />- The pea?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It goes under the mattresses.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.<br />- I'm getting the marshal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You do that!<br />This whole parade is a fiasco!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Let's see what this baby'll do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hey, what are you doing?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Then all we do<br />is blend in with traffic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...without arousing suspicion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Once at the airport,<br />there's no stopping us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Stop! Security.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You and your insect pack your float?<br />- Yes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Has it been<br />in your possession the entire time?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Would you remove your shoes?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Remove your stinger.<br />- It's part of me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I know. Just having some fun.<br />Enjoy your flight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Then if we're lucky, we'll have<br />just enough pollen to do the job.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oan you believe how lucky we are? We<br />have just enough pollen to do the job!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I think this is gonna work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's got to work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Attention, passengers,<br />this is Oaptain Scott.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We have a bit of bad weather<br />in New York.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It looks like we'll experience<br />a couple hours delay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, these are cut flowers<br />with no water. They'll never make it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I gotta get up there<br />and talk to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Be careful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oan I get help<br />with the Sky Mall magazine?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'd like to order the talking<br />inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What'd you say, Hal?<br />- Nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Don't freak out! My entire species...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What are you doing?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!<br />- Who's an attorney?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Don't move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, Barry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Good afternoon, passengers.<br />This is your captain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B<br />please report to the cockpit?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And please hurry!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What happened here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There was a DustBuster,<br />a toupee, a life raft exploded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />One's bald, one's in a boat,<br />they're both unconscious!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Is that another bee joke?<br />- No!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No one's flying the plane!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.<br />What's your status?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is Vanessa Bloome.<br />I'm a florist from New York.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Where's the pilot?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's unconscious,<br />and so is the copilot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Not good. Does anyone onboard<br />have flight experience?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />As a matter of fact, there is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Who's that?<br />- Barry Benson.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />From the honey trial?! Oh, great.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa, this is nothing more<br />than a big metal bee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's got giant wings, huge engines.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can't fly a plane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?<br />- Yes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How hard could it be?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait, Barry!<br />We're headed into some lightning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is Bob Bumble. We have some<br />late-breaking news from JFK Airport,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />where a suspenseful scene<br />is developing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry Benson,<br />fresh from his legal victory...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's Barry!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />...is attempting to land a plane,<br />loaded with people, flowers<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />and an incapacitated flight crew.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Flowers?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We have a storm in the area<br />and two individuals at the controls<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />with absolutely no flight experience.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Just a minute.<br />There's a bee on that plane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson<br />and his no-account compadres.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They've done enough damage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But isn't he your only hope?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Technically, a bee<br />shouldn't be able to fly at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Their wings are too small...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Haven't we heard this a million times?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&quot;The surface area of the wings<br />and body mass make no sense.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Get this on the air!<br />- Got it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Stand by.<br />- We're going live.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The way we work may be a mystery to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Making honey takes a lot of bees<br />doing a lot of small jobs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But let me tell you about a small job.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />If you do it well,<br />it makes a big difference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />More than we realized.<br />To us, to everyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's why I want to get bees<br />back to working together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's the bee way!<br />We're not made of Jell-O.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We get behind a fellow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Black and yellow!<br />- Hello!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Left, right, down, hover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Hover?<br />- Forget hover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This isn't so hard.<br />Beep-beep! Beep-beep!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, what happened?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait, I think we were<br />on autopilot the whole time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- That may have been helping me.<br />- And now we're not!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All of you, let's get<br />behind this fellow! Move it out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Move out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,<br />you copy me with the wings of the plane!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Don't have to yell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm not yelling!<br />We're in a lot of trouble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's very hard to concentrate<br />with that panicky tone in your voice!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's not a tone. I'm panicking!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can't do this!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vanessa, pull yourself together.<br />You have to snap out of it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You snap out of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You snap out of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You snap out of it!<br />- You snap out of it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You snap out of it!<br />- You snap out of it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- You snap out of it!<br />- You snap out of it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Hold it!<br />- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />How is the plane flying?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hello?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Benson, got any flowers<br />for a happy occasion in there?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The Pollen Jocks!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They do get behind a fellow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Black and yellow.<br />- Hello.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right, let's drop this tin can<br />on the blacktop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No, nothing. It's all cloudy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Thinking bee.<br />- Thinking bee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thinking bee!<br />Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wait a minute.<br />I think I'm feeling something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What?<br />- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bring the nose down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thinking bee!<br />Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- What in the world is on the tarmac?<br />- Get some lights on that!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thinking bee!<br />Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Vanessa, aim for the flower.<br />- OK.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Out the engines. We're going in<br />on bee power. Ready, boys?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Affirmative!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Land on that flower!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ready? Full reverse!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Spin it around!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Not that flower! The other one!<br />- Which one?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- That flower.<br />- I'm aiming at the flower!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.<br />I mean the giant pulsating flower<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />made of millions of bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Rotate around it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- This is insane, Barry!<br />- This's the only way I know how to fly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane<br />flying in an insect-like pattern?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.<br />Smell it. Full reverse!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Just drop it. Be a part of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Aim for the center!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oome on, already.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, we did it!<br />You taught me how to fly!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Yes. No high-five!<br />- Right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, it worked!<br />Did you see the giant flower?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What giant flower? Where? Of course<br />I saw the flower! That was genius!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Thank you.<br />- But we're not done yet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Listen, everyone!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This runway is covered<br />with the last pollen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />from the last flowers<br />available anywhere on Earth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That means this is our last chance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're the only ones who make honey,<br />pollinate flowers and dress like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />If we're gonna survive as a species,<br />this is our moment! What do you say?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are we going to be bees, orjust<br />Museum of Natural History keychains?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We're bees!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Keychain!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Then follow me! Except Keychain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hold on, Barry. Here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You've earned this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect<br />fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's our Barry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mom! The bees are back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />If anybody needs<br />to make a call, now's the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I got a feeling we'll be<br />working late tonight!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Here's your change. Have a great<br />afternoon! Oan I help who's next?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Would you like some honey with that?<br />It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.<br />And I don't see a nickel!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sometimes I just feel<br />like a piece of meat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I had no idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, I'm sorry.<br />Have you got a moment?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Would you excuse me?<br />My mosquito associate will help you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sorry I'm late.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He's a lawyer too?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I was already a blood-sucking parasite.<br />All I needed was a briefcase.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Have a great afternoon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,<br />and I can't get them anywhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No problem, Vannie.<br />Just leave it to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're a lifesaver, Barry.<br />Oan I help who's next?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right, scramble, jocks!<br />It's time to fly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thank you, Barry!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That bee is living my life!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Let it go, Kenny.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- When will this nightmare end?!<br />- Let it all go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Beautiful day to fly.<br />- Sure is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Between you and me,<br />I was dying to get out of that office.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You have got<br />to start thinking bee, my friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Thinking bee!<br />- Me?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hold it. Let's just stop<br />for a second. Hold it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.<br />Oan we stop here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm not making a major life decision<br />during a production number!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All right. Take ten, everybody.<br />Wrap it up, guys.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I had virtually no rehearsal for that.",
