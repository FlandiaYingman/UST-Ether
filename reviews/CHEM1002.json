You can also learn a bit of the human biology and how the cosmetic products, like skin whitener, work on the human body. Other than purely concepts, students are also required to memorise all of the chemical names and reaction procedures listed in the powerpoints. This course covers many cosmetic products we can see in daily lives. For the syllabus, you can refer to other posts.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Chan is very passionate in teaching. Since this is a common core couse, he tried his best to explain every concept to students who had never taken a single chemistry course, often by drawing. As a student who had learnt chemistry in high school, I sometimes might find his overly-detailed explanation a bit annoying, but I still appreciated his effort. He always welcomed students to ask questions, and he would try his best to explain concepts to students. Overall, he is one of the best teachers I have ever seen.",

But I would say that many students with no chemistry background would stuggle to memorise them.",
            "comment_workload": "There were only 2 pieces of homework in the course, and they both consisted of only MCs and short questions, so they were easy to finish.<br /><br />However, the mid-term and final exams required a lot of memorising of chemical reactions, so I do not recommend students who had not learnt chemistry in high school to take this course. On the flip side, if you are good with memorising things, this course may be a breeze for you.",

Make sure you have watched all the lecture videos and try to understand everything and you can get most of the marks. YET, there are some questions which he has never taught in the lesson. If you have no chem major friends like me, good luck :(<br /><br />**PLEASE PAY EXTRA ATTENTION TO THE PROJECT Q&amp;A<br />For the group project, the first three parts are still fine but for the Q&amp;A session, IT IS DISASTROUS. <br />The Q&amp;A session is divided into an individual question and some group questions. For the individual question, IT IS TOTALLY UNFAIR. Someone can get questions that are super easy which the answers are clearly shown in the ppt and taught the professor during lectures which are even not related to the ingredients of the cosmetics (the project is all about analyzing the ingredients). Yet, someone can get extremely hard questions that require students to take a deep look to the ingredient list and answer something which has never appeared and taught in the lecture. it is awful and what I can say is good luck to you all who decide to take this course in the future. For the group questions, make sure you have already watched, understood, and revised ALL topics before the Q&amp;A session.<br /><br />I got almost everything above mean except the project Q&amp;A. A- at last but I don't think it is a good grade course at all as the gap between the cut-off score of each sub grading seems to be small. May receive bad grade easily",
