She shows a few videos in class to demonstrate the feelings of the patients suffering these psychological disorders and how they look like.

But don't worry - she will go over the answers thoroughly at the end.",

            "comment_workload": "Quizzes comprise of multiple choice questions that are actually quite tricky and require a thorough understanding of details. Textbook reading is not absolutely required but you will need to go through the relevant chapters in the textbook if you really want to ace the course. Beatrice explicitly said that quite a few questions in the quizzes would be based on the textbook materials not mentioned in class.<br /><br />The group project basically lets us explore a psychological disorder not covered in class and we are required to pick a celebrity/case vignette and explore the etiology, the person's symptoms and the treatment applying the multipath model, i.e. we have to discuss the disorder from the biological, the psychological, the social, and the sociocultural dimensions. Then we need to deliver a 10-minute presentation in class elaborating on our findings and write individually a 600-word essay on the one treatment approach of the disorder. The most challenging part is that you have to be absolutely concise due to the time and word limits. Explaining all these things in a neat manner in merely 10 minutes is not that easy.<br /><br />The class participation marks are based on the submission of class discussion answers. Just make sure you don't skip all the classes and you will be fine. FYI she took attendance 7 times this semester.",

So be prepared to memorise some biological terms. <br /><br />The cases &amp; videos are rather interesting though!

I've taken her SOSC1980 course before so I was familiar with her teaching style. <br /><br />She usually reads off her slides, but will purposely leave some parts out of the notes, so you have to pay attention to get the missing stuff! She might come off as slightly boring at times, but then again, if you're genuinely interested in the subject, you'll be able to pay attention.",

I think my group did alright for the group project, but since the class size is small, and there were only 4 groups in total, it really skewed the grade curve. <br /><br />I ended up with a B range grade (I forgot if its B+/B/B-).
