The first part of the semester you look at three big ethical theories - Virtue Ethics, Deontology, and Utilitarianism.

They did come in handy though when you needed to revise.",

They are nearly 30% each so kind of feels like a mid term/ final even though he calls it a quiz. I would recommend reading the material to get the best marks but you could probably pretty easily get a B by just studying off the powerpoint. <br /><br />He takes attendance. Each lesson counts for 1%.",

Discussion about crime and punishment, death penalty.<br /><br />3rd part: Contemporary issues<br />Euthanasia, hunger and poverty, animal rights and environment.<br /><br />I think the &quot;contemporary issues&quot; part is quite fun and I'm really intersted in it. It is related to our lives and it makes me think about how I should treat the animals and the environment, which are some topics that I have never thought thoroughly before!! And the theories are the basic theories of the ethics world. It is of no disadvantage knowing more of it as long as you are interested. The theories learnt in the first part will be applied in the 2nd and 3rd part. So I kinda felt like the knowledge is really &quot;applied&quot;haahah.",

            "comment_workload": "I think the workload depends on how hard-working you are. If you do not expect too much on grades, then just finishing about 30 pages of powerpoint slides per week is a quite low workload, as there are no homework, only lecture attendance, 2 quizzes and final exam. However, if you want to score a bit above mean, you have to do the readings assigned. There will be a reading with about 6-pages long per lesson, reading all of them will be a tough task, especially for the readings that are written in ancient-style english.",
