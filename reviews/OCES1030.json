The topics include pressing global, regional and local environmental changes; life-supporting systems of our planet; biodiversity and its conservation; atmosphere, water resources, and their pollutions; solid and hazardous waste management; environmental health and sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will gain a sufficient background and a better understanding of the root-causes of the upfront environmental issues. They will also become more aware of their role, as citizens, in environmental protection and sustainable development.",

Cindy講野究極悶,我返到去都係睇youtube (其他堂我唔會咁做, 呢堂我Midterm前都唔會咁做). Recording收音又極差, 睇都唔想睇, 最後final period用1-2個鐘睇下lecture講過啲咩topic就算, 就咁去考, 我知道反正都係撞MC, 溫唔溫都一樣. <br />見到final份卷 Ice Ko嗰part又係靠撞, 一睇就知啲題目溫左書都唔會識.<br /><br />Final 25/60, 仲高過midterm嘅40%. 真係CL77777S<br />Grade係C<br />如果我Midterm都好似final咁完全唔溫, 我諗分數冇咩大分別, 最終應該都係C.<br />呢科分數冇人可以超過80% 你就知道有幾恐怖.<br />但我係想Declare COSC, CGA要3.7啊, 所以我先咁認真讀. <br />比呢科咁樣搞一搞, CGA拉低左0.3-0.4, 幾乎冇左希望.<br />真係比Ice Ko搞到毀左前途.<br /><br />奉勸任何需要GPA嚟declare Major嘅同學遠離呢科.<br />如果你需要一個SSC嘅S&amp;T嚟畢業或者fulfill science foundation requirement. 建議你唔好咁早讀呢科, pre reg比你就好drop左佢.<br />等你唔介意拎C grade嘅時候再去, 入去撞下MC就有C都唔差.<br /><br />如果你期望自己係與眾不同嘅一個,可以靠努力喺呢科拎靚grade, 你大可自己試一試, 祝你好運",

So, don't miss her lectures!<br /><br />As for Cindy, she provides in-class quiz (just for exercises) which I thought really helpful. She's also a good lecturer.<br /><br />QIAN's English is not that good. Sometimes you need to pay some effort to follow him.

Also, the mean of this course is C+/B-, which means if you get 16 in essay and 43 in the final, you will probably get a B- at last. Thus, every choice of your final exam counts a lot. If you want to get a good grade, make sure you do a good review and be really careful in the final. <br /><br />BTW, the final is only 60 minutes for 70 questions, so actually you don't have the time to check the notes, just try to remember as much things as you can.",

Her notes provide info, pictures and sometimes some news clips for our reference in the notes.

(Or rewatch the zoom recordings afterwards like me if u are having remote classes) She will tell us that some tables or additional info are only for reference which will not be test in the exam. However she REALLY loves to talk about stuff that are off topic like how her University life be and ask us some cringe questions. She also loves to talk about additional info or news clips for VERY LONG. (And most of them are not really useful too) Just ignore these part and focus on the notes will make ur life easier.<br /><br />Cynthia Yau:<br />Personally I like her teaching more than Ice Ko. Her notes also clearly state most of the useful info while some of them require u to write it down yourself during the lectures. The pictures, tables and news clips she put in her notes are quite interesting and worth discussing. Those news clips, her questions and even her personal experiences that she shared with us are much more relevant to the context than what Ice Ko shared with us. Nevertheless, I think she is not good at tech and online teaching stuff. The first lesson she sent out the zoom link very late, even pass the starting time.",
            "comment_grading": "Got a B+ overall.<br />Quite good for myself. However, I had study Biology and Chemistry in secondary school. I also study Biology elective Ecology for dse. As most of the context in this lecture are covered in my secondary school already, I didn’t study very much or need to work very very hard on the course to got a B+. If u didn’t study Biology or Ecology before, u may need to work harder to clear ur concepts and revise for this course.",
            "comment_workload": "Not very heavy workload.<br />Originally, Ice Ko said there will be one midterm(testing her notes) and one final(testing Yau’s note). Till 2 weeks before the mid term, she cancelled the midterm exam and change it into 10% a ppt assignment and 90% final(testing hers and Yau’s note together). The pressure is very high cause the weighting of final is high.<br />ppt assignment: (10%)<br />We are required to choose one of the terrestrial biome and make a 7 slide ppt (with apa form citations) according to her reference ppt given. Not very hard or having heavy workload. But many of us worried about the format (eg font size, colour, pictures and citations format) than our context because Ice Ko gave us quite a lot restrictions on format. (eg all font size must not be below 24). I used around a day and a half to finish it and got 7/10.<br />p1: cover<br />p2: main characteristics <br />p3-4: biodiversity <br />p5: major human impact <br />p6: conservation<br />p7: reference<br /><br />Finial exam: (90%)<br />The main problem is testing all 16 topics at the same time and the weighting is very high therefore make me quite worrying. But if u focus in the lectures and had made notes during the lectures, the workload will not be heavy. I used a few days to rewatch most of the lecture zoom recordings and marked some notes&nbsp;&nbsp;for the exam. The final exam is open book online exam. Online format ppt, lecture notes and notes&nbsp;&nbsp;and even google are allowed. Most of them are in the notes and quite of them can be found in google. 100 minutes are given for 100 mc. The time is very tight I finished the exam just before time up. Although google and notes are allowed, u cant check for every question otherwise there will not be enough time.<br />Forgot the actual mark of the final but above mean (and the mean is quite high to as most of the questions are common sense and can google.)",
