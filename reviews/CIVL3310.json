TA always attended lectures, so they were quite helpful addressing your enquiries regarding the course content. <br /><br />‚úÖ Lambros may adopt the short-cut method in solving problems which were quite different from the traditional textbook method. For example, he used kinematic consideration (stability analysis) to perform influence line calculations. <br /><br />‚úÖ Due to the social situation, Lambros uploaded lecture videos for the very last parts of the course, which was a great arrangement and beneficial to our revision. FYI, Lambros never recorded lecture videos in any circumstances in the past years. <br /><br />‚ùå His lecture materials were quite spontaneous as he may ask the class to pick the numbers for his example randomly. Make sure you sit at the first few rows because he did not provide lecture notes. He wrote all the contents on the whiteboard. Therefore you need to copy them. Sometimes his drawings were quite messy, and students were unable to see the numbers and details. So it would be a disadvantage sitting at the very back. Moreover, it is notable to note that Lambros demonstrate the questions at a quick pace. A mediocre student like me always found the lectures hard to follow.",

It is compulsory to attend all the lectures because there were quizzes to be completed, which counted towards your final grade. You will never know when Lambros will assign the quizzes. For off-class workload, you may need to spend substantial time to understand the concepts and examples completely.

The teaching pace in 3310 is much faster than in 2110, ü§Ø STAY ALERT‚ÄºÔ∏è<br />2. There are many errors in his calculation, but he‚Äôll correct them after starting another things, ü§î, making students quite hard to focus.<br />3.

He rushed through the later topics probably due to time constraint. However, you can always ask Lambros about some difficult assignments and request delay on due date. You can interrupt him in lectures too. He also held 2 tutorials during study break to do additional examples and answered students' questions.",

            "comment_workload": "Almost the least workload within the fall semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 4-5 assignments and a lab report, and you can copy from sources. <br /><br />The only workload is to attend lectures and make sure you DO SUBMIT ALL THE QUIZZES (Taking attendance only).<br /><br />Before the final exam, he held an additional tutorial and he will outline the exam questions in class. So the final exam is not that difficult if you go to the tutorial.",
