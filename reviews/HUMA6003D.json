        "description": "This course offers students a careful and in-depth examination of key concepts, figures and topics in phenomenology, a key movement in twentieth-century European philosophy. The aim of phenomenology is to describe and interpret experience and its structures as they are lived. Phenomenology has been described as \"returning to the things themselves\" (Hussar), as \"letting what shows itself be seen from itself\" (Headgear), and as \"placing essences back into existence\" (Merleau-Ponty). We will explore basic philosophical issues such as temporality, spatiality, perception and embodiment, worldliness, intersubjectivity, and the relation between self and others in figures such as Hussar, Headgear, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Levinas.",
