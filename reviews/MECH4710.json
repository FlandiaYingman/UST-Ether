You should have the basic knowledge of matrix before enrolling this course.<br /><br />Course Content:<br />Ch.1: Introduction<br />Ch.2: Spatial descriptions and transformations<br />Ch.3: Manipulator Kinematics<br />Ch.4: Inverse Manipulator Kinematics<br />Midterm: Ch.1-4<br />Ch.5: Jacobians<br />Ch.6: Manipulator dynamics<br />Final: Ch.5-6 <br /><br />For the Final, Ch.1-4 were not included, but they will be used to derive the equations needed in the exam.<br /><br />Overall: <br />Ch.1-3: basic knowledge<br />Ch.4-6: Main focus of this course",
            "comment_teaching": "You might know him before, as he also teaches MECH 3610 Control Principles. if you don't like his teaching style, it might be a problem. <br /><br />I do not have much to say for his teaching style, as I almost skipped all his lessons. But in general, CAI Lilong is a good professor as he will explain things in detail during lectures. However, his notes were quite dull, and the notes are not easy to follow if you did not attend his lesson.<br /><br />Nothing to say for the TA.",
            "comment_grading": "The exam problems are relatively easy, but there were plenty of nerds enrolled, therefore the mean is quite high, and giving a wrong answer would cost a lot. <br /><br />The Midterm problems are quite similar to the assignments, but the Final is a opposite. Nonetheless, if you did revise and UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT, it should not be a problem.<br /><br />I did few hours of basic revision (review lecture notes and assignments only, no additional excise) -&gt; B+<br /><br />Extra Information:<br />Midterm mean: 89 (80+ marks: approx. 80% of the class)<br />Final mean: ???",
