        "description": "This course introduces the basic principles of acting developed by Russian maestro Stanislavsky. Through applying these principles in a series of practical exercises, students will have an experiential understanding of the theory and practice of theatre arts. The in-class activities can give students a refreshing stimulus to both body and mind, unleash their imagination and develop their inborn ability of acting further. Students will also be guided to appreciate the art of an actor by watching a theatre performance. Discussion and analysis will be focused in both historical and current theatre practices. Upon the completion of this course, students will have an elementary understanding of contemporary theatre arts. The course may be offered in separate sections either in Chinese or English. Students are advised to check the medium of instruction/materials before class enrollment.",
