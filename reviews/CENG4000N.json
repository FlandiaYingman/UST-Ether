        "description": "This course aims to deliver the knowledge on the waste transformation to energy utility and functional materials. The course will involve the fundamentals of catalytic system in different sectors including thermo-catalysis, room-temperature catalysis, organics transformation processes, etc. Different case studies of practical applications will be delivered to the students. The corresponding catalyst design, the built-up of the reactor system, and the effects of the system parameters will be described. This course will provide the practical designing knowledge in the catalytic reaction system, particularly for energy harvesting and functional materials fabrication technologies.",
