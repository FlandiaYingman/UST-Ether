It first teaches you the ER Model (similar to class diagrams in COMP3111) and how to extract information from a problem statement. Then, it teaches you the Relational Model, ie. converting the &quot;class&quot; diagram into different tables. Finally, there are 3 lessons on Oracle SQL where you learn how to make queries, create tables and insert table data.<br /><br />However, the second half of the course is a LIVING HELL since everything is theoretical. You'll learn the data structures and algorithms used behind database management system and it's difficult as fuck 😪. The query optimization part is the most difficult and confusing since there're endless possibilities to evaluate a query and you need to provide the most optimized plan to process it. Most of the time I don't know what the fuck I'm doing 😩😩😩😩",
            "comment_teaching": "TLDR: Professor is a nice guy with very fluent English. However, he basically SPEEDRUNS every lesson since there are too much content to cover and around 70% of the time you'll feel completely lost and confused at the end of the lecture 😫😫<br /><br />📃 Teaching Style<br />He's fine in explaining the concepts on the slides and sometimes he emphasizes on some tricky parts and concepts. He is also very responsive to student's questions in Zoom (this semester is online due to COVID) and he can answer all the questions relatively quickly. However, every lesson is packed with rich content and he loves teaching at an INSANELY FAST speed, which is IMPOSSIBLE to catch up unless you're a genius. Every lesson feels like a world-record speedrun attempt and I usually get completely lost at around half way though the lesson 😪😪<br /><br />The craziest lecture is lecture 5 on 2NF, 3NF and BCNF. Someone on YouTube has made a 6 hour playlist on the exact same content but the professor managed to cram all of that in a 1.5 hour lesson 😈. Just watch this playlist instead: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo5W4Nhv31b33kF46f9aFjoJPOkdlsRc<br /><br />📃 Teaching Materials<br />The teaching materials are well designed in general. Each lecture has its own lecture slide, in-class worksheet and a worksheet solution (released at the next lesson), and they are well designed. However, the slides are a bit confusing to understand for the second half of the course.<br /><br />📃 Tutorials &amp; Labs<br />The &quot;teaching&quot; in tutorials is kinda shitty since the TA just reads out the tutorial slides and the exercise solutions. The labs exercises are pretty useful for you to practice writing SQL and PL/SQL though.",
            "comment_grading": "TLDR: Quite good grade.

I got an A- at the end, which is totally out of my expectation. I feel like most of the students are confused with the course material so the mean is not unusually high 😛.",
            "comment_workload": "TLDR: Feels like a 4-credits course. Shit ton of things to be submitted and requires lots of time to revise and study 😪😪😪.<br /><br />📝Lesson, tutorial and lab exercises<br />This is fucking insane. We need to complete and submit a worksheet (1 or 2 pages) for every lesson, tutorial and lab (9 labs in total) at 11pm within the same date. These exercises can take from 5~10 minutes to as long as 1 hour to complete if you're answering them seriously. Since everyone get lost at the end of the lecture, you're forced to revise the lecture slides within the same day in order to know how to do those exercises and this is very time consuming. <br /><br />📝Project<br />The project is also very time-consuming and each task takes me around 7~10 hours to complete. The first task is to draw an ER model based on a problem statement, which is quite difficult since you need to pay attention to many small details. The second task is even more annoying since you need to go through the problem statement multiple times in order to extract all the constraints that needed to be set when defining the tables in SQL. The third task is a little bit better, but we still need to write 40 short to medium SQL queries in a C# file.<br /><br /> 📝Mid-term and Final<br />Since I got confused in almost every lesson, I need to spend a shit ton of time to revise the lecture slides when preparing for the mid-term and final exam. The final exam is also cumulative so I need to spend extra time revising for the first half of the course.<br /><br />In summary, this feels like a 4-credits course. In fact, I've completed several 4-credits course like COMP2012, COMP3111 and MATH2411 and NONE of these courses have higher workload than this course",

            "comment_content": "Only 3 lessons on SQL. I have learnt it so I do pretty well on mid-term. The content before midterm was make sense. However, the content after midterm was 3 or 4 times before the midterm. Most of the content you would not use again, except you want to be a database manager in the future. This content was not just about SQL, it covered most of the materials in cs, like comp2611, comp3511, c++, networking, web, java. You take one course, you can gain 10 courses' knowledge. I think the huge different style before and after midterm was because the textbook. This guy chose two different&nbsp;&nbsp;textbooks and the styles of them were totally different. He just copied and pasted the content from the textbook to his ppt so it made the style quite different after midterm. Most of the topic on final, like PL/SQL and database API and web API, he even did not teach them or just skip them. However, the questions were very difficult in the final exam.",
            "comment_teaching": "This guy was even worse than Dekai. This is not a joke. He just read the ppt every lesson and rushed very fast after midterm since the content was like a 5-credits course. Sometime, I asked him some questions, but he even could not answer me correctly. If you do not trust me how bad he was, just do it!!!! just do it!!!!",
            "comment_grading": "Since this semester conducted online exam, so the SQL part would directly run by machine, no any marks for your steps. You would got 0 if your SQL cannot compile on his machine. Thus, this was quite unfair because everyone might have typo in his/her code. I got full mark in the 4 assignments and attendance, 9x/100 in midterm and 7x/100 in final (the final was extremely difficult).<br />The above is what I have typed before releasing the grade and I want to give it another E on grading orginally (If you have seen other reviews in other semesters, you would know how bad the grade was). But honestly, I got A+ finally. Then, I think giving it a B on grading is quite fair. However, you cannot take this as a consideration. I think he gave all of us very good grade on this semester because of online teaching. I believe I can only get A- at most at the regular term. You should take some reviews in other semesters as a consideration.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is very light. The good thing is you don't need to do too much but the bad thing is obvious. You would not have chance to do practice as the assignment could only cover around 5% of the materials after the mid-term (only 1 pa after midterm but the content was 3 times before). He would post some self-practice exercise on his website, I finished them all and the exercise in tutor but I think this was still not enough.",

Also, boring is definitely a problem when having too much information.<br /><br />For the final, in past paper, you will see some question which is so called 玄學 (metaphysics by google translate) like calculating cost, join in QEP. However, for this professor, as what he said, his final exam does not require calculator. He doesn't require us to calculate join/select cost. He just ask for the principle and formula of the join which already teach us in tutorial and lecture. For query optimization, what you need is assumption base on the rule in notes, not imagination. His final exam is really better than other professor design since every question is reasonable. <br /><br />But there are still some problems in the course. The answer of final and midterm exercise is not released. How do we know are there any mistake when the TA revising the examination papers? Also, the exam format is change before an hour of final. We suddenly require to finish the exam in word. However, a question require us to use some symbol and we don't know how to type it. This is so bad and I hope it won't happen again.",

However, I would say that the grading is excellent. I have never seen a COMP course providing such a good grade. <br /><br />A - 15% B - 40% C - 40% D/F 5%<br />You can see that this professor has maximized the B range. If you are lucky, it is possible that you can get B- even below mean while other COMP course professor gives you C+ even if you above mean. Also, C range is maximum by combining D and F together so if you really bad at final, you can still get C or C-",

Since professor doesn't want to give us too many workload, you can obtain the score by just submitting the exercise. Also, the answer is released with the exercise and explain in tutorial so if you are busy, you can just copy the answer try to understand it when you are free.",

            "comment_content": "Very hands-on and practical. We've got to learn how to manage a relational database from design to implementation using Oracle. While DBMS technology is actually quite old, it's still very widely used in a lot of companies and I'm sure most of us would find it useful.<br /><br />The highlight of the course is definitely SQL. Don't underestimate its difficulty - SQL grammar is simple, but its usage is tricky. The logic of formulating SQL is often not that trivial and requires some little twists or tricks.<br /><br />After the midterm, the content then moves to the physical level of the database. This part is more theoretical and conceptually demanding. Basic understanding in algorithms and data structures such as binary trees, B+ trees and hashing would help.<br /><br />Wilfred also introduced NoSQL this year. But due to time limitation, not much implementation could be taught. If you're interested, you can move on self-learning and playing around the more trendy technologies like MongoDB and Hadoop.<br /><br />1️⃣ Introduction to DBMS<br />2️⃣ ER Model<br />3️⃣ Relational Algebra<br />4️⃣ SQL<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 DDL, DML<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 PL/SQL, Cursors, Triggers<br />5️⃣ Normalization<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 3NF<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 BCNF<br />6️⃣ Physical File Organization<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Indexing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Query Optimizer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 RAID<br />7️⃣ Transaction Management<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 ACID Properties<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Recovery<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Concurrency Control<br />8️⃣ NoSQL Databases<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 BASE Principles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 MapReduce<br />9️⃣ Database APIs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 ODBC<br /><br />This is a real introductory course - you're only expected to have basic C++ programming and algorithm background, which I think are reasonable. I've seen so many other courses that unrealistically expected us to have already learned the thing in order to take the course. Ridiculous. This course, while still difficult, has a much more manageable learning curve. You don't need to know DBMS beforehand in order for you to take this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Not quite sure why so many students bitch about Wilfred's teaching (because he gives bad grades?) I personally love his teaching - He's very beginner-friendly, starting from the basic and walking through with you all the necessary steps. (I also took his Java course in my year 1) He's deffo a lot better than the usual type of professors that treats everyone as genii and casually skips details in explanation.<br /><br />悶唔悶其次，起碼聽得明。<br /><br />The 2 Indian tutorial TAs are quite good. They can explain things in a fluent and logical manner. But some lab TAs have lots of rooms for improvement. It's not nice if the TAs have a monotonic soft voice and deliver in a way as if they're just talking to themselves.",

The 3rd assignment is on SQL, including database definition and writing complex queries. The 4th one is a C++ programming assignment on ODBC. These 2 programming assignments will take you longer time and make sure you've got enough test cases to check for the robustness.<br /><br />The marking on the assignments is quite strict.

            "comment_content": "这门课的主要内容:<br />midterm前:<br />- ER model<br />- Relational Model<br />- Relational Algebra<br />- SQL<br />- Functional Dependency<br />- 3NF, BCNF<br /><br />midterm后:<br />- Memory Hierarchy<br />- Database Indexing<br />- Query Processing + Optimisation<br />- Transaction<br />- Concurrency Control<br />- Database Recovery<br />***我们的ppt跟很多不同大学的笔记一模一样，相信教授在做这些slides时也花了很多功夫上网参考其它大学的database课。<br /><br />作为elective的课，从midterm前的SQL query到midterm后的database理论，这门课结合了大量关于database的知识。有的童鞋可能会说，midterm前学的更为practical，以后做工才可能会用到，而midterm后的都是以后不可能会用到的。我只能说，这样想的童鞋不如自己去自学SQL，相信能节省更多时间，不必花一门课、一个学期去学database。再次强调，这是一门elective课，不可能只想要进来划划水，学写一些SQL就算。这门课除了要教童鞋们写SQL之外，更多的是要provide童鞋们在database方面一个更全面的认知。<br /><br />虽然有时我也不太赞同教授企图把很大量的知识都挤在一门课内教完，但我认为大多数知识都是重要、有用的，只不过会让人有些消化不过来。无论是以后想往database方向发展还是只纯粹想学学database的童鞋，都强烈推荐上这门课，感觉上读CS的人都应该要对database有不错的认识。<br /><br />忠告：这门课不适合抱大腿和刷grade",
            "comment_teaching": "只上了第一堂和最后一堂课。感觉上教授只跟着他的ppt念，所以不上课也行。然而，看得出教授很用心教课，上课时也尽量与童鞋互动，但因为内容本身就有点闷，而且教授语音也比较flat，导致最后上课的童鞋寥寥无几。<br /><br />至于tutorial，只上了第一堂。好几位TA有严重口音，很难明白他们在说什么。",
