Ms Crystal gives character writing exercise so that we can be familiarized with the words. She also gave a vocab word list so that we can memorize the meaning of each characters. <br /><br />Finals is much harder than midterms because the characters get more complex and hard to write and the final exam covers all units tested in midterm. She did not specify how the grading goes but I think it is not a curve. Try to get high marks as possible. <br /><br />Fair grading<br /><br />Midterm and Final exam is out of 60<br />Final score: B",
