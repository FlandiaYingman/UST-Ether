There are a lot of international and exchange students.<br />• There are a fuck ton of final year students in this course. <br /><br />I'm a second year kid and I think I was fine. I think I know a lot more about my personality now. That is really something. I don't remember much from my other courses since I cram a day before the finals. <br /><br />Lot of personality tests (too lazy to do them normally), however you have to reference them in the logs so I had to complete them.<br /><br />Got to speak to 70% of the people in my class and made a lot of friends. No midterm no final. one 3 hour class where you just basically socialise.<br /><br />10/10 would do again.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor was good. He is chilled out, makes class relaxing.Quality lad who is always up for some banter after class. <br /><br />Very clear english. Well structured class. Energetic. Can't ask for more.<br /><br />Ace of a guy, marry him if I could.",
            "comment_grading": "A+ <br />I did almost nothing for the course so I felt it was brilliant. <br />98/100 in final reflection log<br />93, 92, 95 in other logs<br />9/10 and 10/10 in quiz<br />Talked a lot in class.",
            "comment_workload": "Did some of my friends spend a lot of time on their logs? Yes<br />Did most? Probably Not.<br />I just started writing my logs a few hours before the deadline (yes, I had to stay up because of my laziness) and I got a decent score.<br /><br />I could spend a lot more time on my core courses, and write bs in the reflection logs when I was tired on Sunday evening.",
