        "description": "The goal of this course is to introduce how various analysis techniques can be used to manage the quality of a software application.  Students will acquire fundamental knowledge of program abstraction, features, verification, testing, refactoring, concurrency, reliability, aspect orientation, and fault analysis.  The course will also discuss how to carry out the empirical experimentation for program analysis.  Wherever applicable, concepts will be complemented by tools developed in academia and industry.  This enables students to understand the maturity and limitations of various analysis techniques.",
