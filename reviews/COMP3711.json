            "comment_workload": "The workload of this course is an absolute nightmare. Although there are no group projects or presentations, the homework itself is enough to give the experience of hell.<br /><br />There is 5 homework, with the 3rd one being double-sized, which is assumed to alleviate the workload of the course by replacing midterm with it. The homework has many questions asked for proof, which makes students found frustrating and took a long time to do.<br /><br />For me, it cost me the whole easter holiday to finish HW3 and finalized HW5 one day before the deadline (And not to mention that the deadline of HW5 was extended for 4 more days before the release of the homework. This means, if the deadline wasn't extended, I am unable to finalize it into the best version).<br /><br />During the period of HW3, some claimed that they &quot;transcended to another dimension&quot;, had mental breakdowns, and even stated HW3 is &quot;scarier than horror films&quot;. (I wasn't joking here, they really put these statements on Piazza!) You may imagine how insane these assignments can get.<br />At last, the teaching team came up with an agreement with the students to put up fewer algorithm design problems in the homework (like 50:50 ratio with problems requiring running algorithms).<br /><br />You may think that since the homework is hard, and so does the final exam. However, the final exam is much easier than the homework. One reason is that it is a closed book exam, even though it is &quot;more orientated to algorithm design questions&quot;.<br />Prof. Golin stated that since the questions on homework are too dense (i.e. takes too much time to think), they appear on homework but not exams (even for questions similar to the ones in homework).<br /><br />Side note: For Non-CSE students who somehow wish to take this course (e.g. CPEG students who want to take it as an elective), please think thrice before actually taking it, especially please evaluate the expected workload first.",

            "comment_content": "1. The content is actually simplified<br />In particular, this course has greatly simplified the discussion on depth-first search and topological sorting, and didn't talk about the notion of NP completeness. But given the CSE course pathway design, this simplification is actually reasonable.<br /><br />2. You better do self-learning before the start of the semester<br />Just because the content is simplified does not mean the content is simple! This is especially true when you are just an average student without experience in algorithm class (like me), since this course covers many algorithms in a rapid pace which, I think, an average beginner could hardly catch up. I would advise you to AT LEAST do the following before the semester starts:<br />- Get familiar with all divide-and-conquer algorithm and sorting algorithms (by get familiar, you should also understand all their properties and proofs)<br />- Grasp a basic idea on greedy algorithm and dynamic programming (e.g. the greedy choice property and the optimal substructure property)<br />- Get familiar with these graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Topological sort, MST (Prim and Kruskal), SP (Dijkstra), APSP (Floyd-Warshall) (Again, by get familiar, you should also understand all their properties and proofs)<br />Although these topics comprise almost all the content of the whole course, I guarantee that you would have a much smoother and easier course experience by doing this. (I guarantee that my guarantee is better than Kenneth's guarantee!) The contents of this course are not easily absorbable for an average student.<br /><br />3. Prove by contradiction and M.I. (and its variants) are very important to this course.<br /><br />4. Better pay attention to these topics (and their variants) when preparing for the final exam (the following is essentially a summary of the kind of questions that has appeared in the exam set by professor Golin and Ma):<br /><br />- Asymptotic notation and recurrence<br />- Properties of sorting algorithms (e.g. best-case, average-case, worst-case running time, and stability)<br />- Sorting lower bound (comparison tree model)<br />- Radix sort on integers of bounded range<br />- Indicator R.V.<br />- Divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g. subset-sum, x-discounted MCS, and designing the variants of binary search)<br />- Greedy algorithms (e.g. interval scheduling, interval partitioning, subsequence, minimum stopping)<br />- ****Dynamic Programming**** This topic is VERY IMPORTANT, since questions of this topic are usually the killer (e.g. longest monotone sequence, shuffling, minimum cost itinerary, x-discounted MCS, doubled string)<br />- BFS, DFS and Topological sort (How to apply or modify them to fit in other situations)<br />- MST (the cut lemma, prove by contradiction and counter-example)<br />- Dijkstra algorithm (its correctness proof)<br />- Variants of Floyd-Warshall algorithm (e.g. all-pair max-bottleneck problem)<br />- Application of maximum flow<br />- Dry-run of these algorithms: min-heap, AVL tree, sorting algorithms, Huffman tree, BFS, DFS, MST (Prim and Kruskal), SP (Dijkstra), Max-flow and Bipartite matching, Pattern matching automaton",

The focus is in learning algorithms instead of the your problem-solving ability.",

Sometimes he will ask some questions that clarify the correctness of an algorithm but most of the class doesn't get what he's trying to ask which is kind of funny. (because he doesn't want to reveal too much in his conceptual questions) <br /><br />He tried to make some jokes during lectures occasionally e.g., &quot;two-child policy&quot; in the correctness of huffman-encoding. He also repeatedly asked us to not think about algorithms during DP lecture in the course &quot;Design and Analysis of Algorithms&quot;.<br /><br />The PowerPoint of both lecture and tutorial are very-well designed like all COMP courses.

It's certainly ok for you to do so since the course has nothing to do with C++. What you need is a little bit of &quot;mathematics sense&quot; and a basic idea of what complexity means. I also don't think COMP2711/2711H is any helpful to this course so you may waive that as well if you are really interested in taking this algorithm course in year 1. COMP2711/2711H is more helpful for COMP5711/5712.<br /><br />4 assignments throughout the semester. Some problem in assignment is quite difficult and may take you some time to figure out. On average, each assignment takes me about 5 hours to finish (most of the time is spent on formatting latex). I got almost full marks in asm1-3 except I always forgot to state the running time of some trivial algorithms. I also run binary merge tree wrong in asm4. That causes quite a lot of marks so you need to be careful and double-check your assignments since mean is usually around 80-90%.<br /><br />Both mid-term and final exam is of moderate difficulty but time is quite limited. The TAs is lenient on marking though. You don't need extremely rigorous proof. I tried to give formal proofs in mid-term, ending up not having enough time to finish some easy problems.",

Each will take around a few days to complete if you aren't particularly talented like me.<br /><br />50% Final: 2 parts, in total 11 questions, by the grace of God it is easier than the assignments, a few questions will be just simply dryrunning the algorithms explained in class, and the complexity of the design questions is pretty low, studying the notes and assignments carefully should mean you can handle the questions decently.<br /><br />Ended up 1% above mean overall, B, quite surprised",

So please attend the tutorials, there are some hints for the HWs and exam! <br /><br />There are also a final exam. Prof provided a lot of past papers, so you can practice and know how to answer them! Prof also said that the final exam is orientated to algorithm design problems as the assignments have a lot of working example, it is about 60-40(design - working example). I think it is fair and the questions are not that difficult (except the DP).<br /><br />我用中文講啦，如果唔係CS compulsory，我諗唔會有人reg呢科，因為真係好難好難同好難，由其是你無數學底或者你睇唔明math notation <br />如果你係CS一定要讀嘅，最好比多啲時間呢科+努力啲做題目 <br />同埋要衡量下係咪要一個sem讀曬3111 3511 3711.我建議唔好 <br />同埋好多人話呢3科都爛grade，其實3111同3511唔算爛，3711先真係爛，不過3科嘅教學都麻麻",

            "comment_content": "Among all CS compulsory courses, this one(3711) and COMP2011+12/2012H, in my opinion, are proboably the most important courses. The content of COMP3711 basically never changes since it's about &quot;classic algorithms&quot;, not the ML or DL algorithms that could be changing and developing everyday nowadays. <br /><br />Main Topics:<br />~ The idea of divide and conquer<br />~ The idea of greedy algorithm<br />~ Dynamic programming (1D/2D/interval)<br />~ Graph algorithms (from BFS/DFS to shortest paths)<br />~ Max flow problems<br /><br />From my perspective, &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;DP&quot; are about getting the idea, or the approach of thinking, while Graph algorithms really seems like a game of memorization, well at least I wasn't smart enough to figure out any &quot;generic&quot; idea behind them.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ever since entering ust and getting into CS major, I have been imagining taking this course from Prof Golin, because every rumor I heard about Golin is about how clear his teaching is. And I know he normally teaches this course. And also most rumors I heard about prof Papadias is how weird his accent is and how difficult it is to follow his lectures. So at first when I saw it was prof Papadias who was going to be the course instructor this semster, I was very disappointed and really wanted to drop the course. <br /><br />But it turns out that Papadias's teaching is just great! Yes, he has a strong greek accent, but it's absolutely undestandable, it's even easier to follow compared to the Chinese accent of some professors I think. Aside from the accent, everything else is very clear. He explains each concept clearly and in an organized manner, he also give plenty of examples to help us understand. And despite this was an online semester, he fully utilized the zoom chat to make the lecture as interactive as possible. I haven't really taken a course from Golin, but if all rumors about how good Golin's teaching is are true, I think Papadias's lectures are every bit as good as Golin's lectures.<br /><br />But there are two major difference between Papadias and golin's style. (See Grading and Workload section)",
            "comment_grading": "Usually if Golin is the only instructor of this course or coteaching this course with other instructors, golin will be the course coordinator, that means he gets to decide grading scheme. And Golin's style is to give a so called &quot;guarantee grading&quot;. (you may probably find the details about this in comp3711 review on Golin) And that &quot;guarantee&quot; is a &quot;lower bound guarantee&quot;, so as long as your overall score is high enough, you can secure an A range. But when Papadias is the only insturctor of the course (and hence the course coordinator), he doesn't have this &quot;guarantee&quot; scheme. Instead, it's pure curved grading. <br /><br />And it turns out that because the final exam is much easier this semester, the mean reached an astonishing 80 (which is probably never seen in comp3711 history I think), with an sd of 17. The mean of the final was even higher than many of the homework asignments. <br /><br />But despite that, since Papadias already gave an A range of 25%,&nbsp;&nbsp;which is normally the largest A range allowed according to ust policy (Bad Guy UST, why not allow for more A), I should say the grading of this course (at least this semester) is very good.<br /><br />And I also heard that the mean is B, while Golin claimed his mean is usually C+/B-, which is &quot;standard ust&quot;, quoted from Goin.",
            "comment_workload": "&quot;The workload of comp3711 is isane&quot;, this is what I heard for a thousand times before taking this course. However, the workload was ideed not small, but not that &quot;insane&quot;. <br /><br />This is probably another important difference between Golin and Papadias's style. Golin emphasizes a lot on proofs. He has a very standard and strict requirement on writing rigrous proofs for many kind of algorithms, which could often end up in pages. But Papadias has an more &quot;algorithmetic focus&quot;. He doesn't focus that much on proofs, but instead on the intuition and design of algorithms. So Papadias's assignments are lengthy, but the difficult part is about coming up with the idea of the algorithm, not writing pages of long and rigorous proofs. So the workload is actually smaller than I imageined.",

It's assignments are really time and brain cells killer...<br /><br />There are relatively more &quot;worked&quot; problems in assignments this semester.<br />E.g. Given a graph with 10+ vertices. Find out minimum spanning tree / all-pairs shortest paths / max flow. We must show every substeps in details (the parents and distance form after adding a new vertices).<br />Using coding to finish assignments is a good approach. You can choose if you prefer to code or write it by hands (iPad recommended).<br />I have no idea if TA has done these problems by their own in advance. Doing such tedious process with so many times is kinda useless. I mean, the given data set could be smaller and we can still have a good practice on this concept.<br /><br />Professor and TA may think that as we almost stay in our home all the time, we would have much more time to spend on our assignments.<br />Well, it's actually true. But workloads become disastrous when all professors think in that way.<br /><br />To deal with these stupid tedious worked questions, I have almost no time for reviewing contents.<br />It's not about if you're a genius or not. It's just about time management and your patience.",

We do not have COMP3711H this year. Therefore it may be better if you study this course in Yr2 Spring if you really want to get a job in the Fall recruiting season.<br /><br />1. Divide and Conquer, different sorting.<br />Introduction of different sorting algorithms. Learn how to use recursion to deal with problems. Some other sorting algorithm like quicksort, heapsort, linear sort are also taught.<br /><br />2. Greedy<br />Be greedy and take the best one among all choices in each steps, but...how do you define &quot;best&quot;? Very hard to proof its correctness, usually simple in implementation.<br /><br />3. Dynamic Programming<br />Very powerful tool that usually performed in optimization problems. Bottom-up approach of building up solutions compared to divide and conquer (top-down approach). The recurrence relationship will be key in this topic.<br /><br />4. Graph algorithms<br />BFS, DFS, Minimal Spanning Trees (Prim, Kruskal), Shortest Path algorithm (Dijkstra), Max-Flow-Min-Cut theorem, Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.<br />The Max-Flow-Min-Cut is the best thing I learnt in this course, an effective tool solving many other problems.<br /><br />5.

            "comment_workload": "The workload depends on your mathematical background, compare this course to those strict, rigorous math courses (e.g. MATH2033), this course is relatively loose in grading our proofs. Usually you still get full marks in your assignments/exam if you leave a bit loophole in your proofs (even one time I know my proof is not complete, but the TA still give full marks).<br /><br />The assignment 1 will be a big bomb for those who doesn't know how to write proofs, as somehow it requires a bit mathematical background to finish those upper bound/lower bound proofs (limit of sequences, epsilon-delta will help a lot).<br /><br />As the course progress, the assignments are easier, it no longer need an a-ha moment, but simply something covered in class.<br /><br />For the final exam, I am disappointed by its format, being a past-paper analysis course. There is one question from last year past paper directly, and mainly the proof questions comes from those already derived in lecture notes (Greedy proof of interval scheduling, Comparison-based sorting algorithms lower bound). What is the most disappointing is, there is only one question about graph, to draw BFS and DFS diagrams.<br /><br />I study my exam by understanding those key insight of each problem and proofs and I write the complete proof by those key insights then since I don't believe the exam will be a reciting game. However, for those who cannot regenerate the proof by key insights, congratulations, you can spend days and days reciting all the proofs and past paper. They are lenient in giving us the past papers. I would say this is good in some sense as hard work can really get you a good grade, since the professor promise for a grade lower bound, it doesn't hurt anyone that much. <br /><br />But I just don't believe that this is the correct way to examine students in a relatively hard course. Or maybe it will be a completely different story in COMP3711H but I don't have a choice this semester. I admit that in terms of hard work, I do not deserves an A+ compared to those who recite all materials.",

            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Golin has good working ethics.<br />First, he knows how to teach. Generally, whenever he goes over an algorithm, he runs step-by-step example to give you intuition. <br />Second, he values feedback. Almost every lecture he stays behind and answer questions in details. And when I say answering questions, he really try understanding your hardship, for example, making wrong assumptions, lacking essential knowledge. Most of the time it isn't about the complexity of content but we, students, forgetting the essential assumptions.<br />Third, he answers email. I heard from him that quite some students simply take reference for their assignments, especially given this special semester where we have 7 assignments in total. So, I basically send him emails every time we have an assignment since I literally do each of them myself. Of course, they aren't dumb questions and I don't recommend you sending him dumb questions also. And he answered each of them timely and precisely. When I say timely, it is like within 2 hours even at night time like 2200. To be honest, this is admirable.<br />Last but not least, he encourages questions. So for example, since I was so busy and literally started revising 5 days before the exam and I got some questions on pastpapers, he literally told me to have a Zoom meeting for like half an hour for clearing all concepts.<br />To be brutally frank, this is an introductory course. So the content isn't that &quot;exciting&quot;. But you can see his enormous effort in making sure that students truely understand a concept both intuitively and rigorously.",

Thus, we have<br />50% assignments (6 in total, with one having 200 marks, it's about dynamic programming)<br />50% final<br />I am not going to enumerate each assignment's mean. Rather, I would just go over the overall mean.<br />Assignment: mean: 80 no sd<br />Final: mean: 55 SD: 19<br />My grades:<br />Assignment: 90<br />Final: 82<br />Grade: A-<br /><br />Prof. Golin has mentioned about the threshold. For example, if you go above 90% in course overall, it is guaranteed A range. In addition, this course is using a curve. That is why I got A-.<br /><br />Grading is tough in some sense. For assignments, you really need to nail the intuition rigorously. It isn't easy.",
            "comment_workload": "Now, it really depends since to be honest, you can really copy all the references into your assignments and get it done. You can also text some of your friends that have taken this course previously. I mean, there are literally multiple ways for scoring high in assignments, which are the most important thing to establish your concepts.<br />At the end of the day, it is your motivation. I spent a lot of time in doing all assignments by myself as well as perfecting them. <br />Also, please note that I type it in Latex. So it takes extra time again.<br />Not to mention the working problems in assignments where I coded the solution. Man, you can really decide the workload.<br />Second, tutorials.<br />There are literally on average 8 weekly tutorials. Not going to lie but if you cannot grasp the concept right after the lecture, those tutorials will simply overwhelm you.<br />And they are important since assignments maybe related to them!!!<br />And so the last thing is final. <br />Well, you literally need to memorize all the stuff, for example, some proofs so as not to screw yourself when there is such a question.<br />And there are literally 16 pastpapers offered by the professor.<br /><br />so as i said, this course can be tough if you take it seriously which I believe most don't.",

All the contents are just primary stuff of algorithms, it's a good start if you like algorithms, but taking this course is far from even a shallow endeavor to actual algorithm research. You still need a lot of practice on the Leetcode problems if you want to enter big-name IT companies even though you earn a high score in this course.",

Admittedly, Cheng, Siu Wing is indeed an excellent researcher in algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp;but his teaching is a nightmare. He speaks monolithically, trying to explain every algorithm, but with too much lengthy background introduction. It is very hard to get the core idea of algorithms if you just follow his lecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;His lecture will only get you familiar with each algorithm and academic terms, but you really need to work harder by yourself after a lecture to gain a more insightful understanding. So my suggestion would be not even attending his lecture. Besides, the midterm problems set by him are more of a testing of reading and understanding of English than actually solving the algorithm problem: a single problem itself is more than 1 page long! I don't know why he did this to us, because as far as I know, only a few students taking this course are actually English native speakers. Dimitris teaches pretty well although he is not an expert in algorithm study,&nbsp;&nbsp;it's worth attending his lecture. He will give you inspirational insight into algorithm design (especially for the dynamic programming part).&nbsp;&nbsp;And the HW and final exam problems set by him are more reasonable, some of them come from Leetcode problems.",
