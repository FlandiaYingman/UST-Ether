        "description": "This course analyses public policy from a comparative perspective. It focuses on how social science explains cross-country differences in the processes and outcomes of public policy. The first part of the course introduces a number of theoretical approaches to comparative public policy analysis. The second part applies the above approaches to several prominent domains of public policy, such as social welfare, education, health care, fiscal and environmental policies, and discusses the relevant issues and choices in some selected countries or jurisdictions. Students benefit from the perspectives into cross-national comparison and lesson drawing for making public policy.",
