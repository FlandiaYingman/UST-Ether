While it is sufficient for UG level physics, you don't learn too much in this course. If you wish to go more in depth, I would suggest taking PHYS 5110.",

All of the questions are extremely straightforward and can be solved using Mathematica if you are stuck.<br /><br />You are allowed to bring in a single double-sided A4 cheat sheet for the exams. While the exams are within the syllabus, the questions will be out of the scope of the textbook. If you wish to do well in the exams, I would suggest looking at other textbooks.",
