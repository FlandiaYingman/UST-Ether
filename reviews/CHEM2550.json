It includes a series of organic and inorganic experiments related to the theory learnt in the lecture courses. Students will be trained to perform a wide range of basic synthetic chemistry laboratory techniques, operate chemical instruments in laboratory, relate the physical and chemical principles and theory in practice and develop their data interpretation and analyzing skills. For CHEM students only.",

            "comment_teaching": "Fair, overall. <br />Most of the teaching was done by Prof. Veronica and TAs. They are helpful and keen to answer your questions.<br /><br />One tip is that it might be helpful for you to ask about the experiment report grading scheme because these so-called &quot;terms &amp; conditions&quot; for getting the full mark are quite harsh and condition-specific.<br /><br />Also, if you have any doubts about the lab quiz grade, ask Prof. Veronica. She might give you some extra marks back if you're logic is reasonable.",

            "comment_workload": "You need to read lab manuals and watch several experiment videos before doing the experiments. <br /><br />The purpose of doing this is all about the lab quizzes not performing the experiment itself. The videos are somewhat long but just sparing some time for the day before the experiment would be enough. <br /><br />For the report, you MUST read the document called the &quot;guideline for lab report writing&quot; and check whether you missed some critical points. This is very important for you to get a full mark and not lose points in a ridiculous way. (The reason why I'm saying &quot;ridiculous&quot; is that their reasons for deducting marks are many times absurd. Believe me.)",
