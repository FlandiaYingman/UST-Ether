            "comment_workload": "The content of this course is even richer than that of SOSC3900 Abnormal psychology, which is also taught by Beatrice, although lots of content of SOSC2990 is much simpler and is like common sense. But it does not mean it's easier to get a good grade because the mean is terribly high. I would rather she gave higher weight to both quizzes because I spent plenty of time on re-watching the lecture recording, jotting down notes, memorizing all of the points in each slide because you won't have time to check the notes for the answers during the 30-minute quizzes in spite of open-book quizzes due to COVID-19. I think both quizzes are what truly reflect our personal effort in this course, as you have to study lots of content and the quiz's questions require you to have a pretty thorough understanding of the concepts/theories and to differentiate the differences between several concepts/theories, some questions are quite tricky although many students eventually answer them correctly as UST students are not foolish after all, that is why the mean is surprisingly high even though most students skip regular lectures.<br /><br />The group project is time-consuming, due to take-home help kit. Having groupmates good at computer and design would help a lot.",
