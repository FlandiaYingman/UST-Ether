Questions asked by Ice Ko in cantonese<br />*couldn't rember the exact wordings&quot;<br />e.g. <br />如果呢個course嘅workshop你其他活動撞時間你會點做？<br />你係點做 time management？<br /><br /><br />Remember to be Punctual and expect delay from the previsous session. <br /><br />In my case Ice Ko spent total an hour interviewing, though we only spoke for no longer than 2 minues per student. <br /><br />The remaining time were for Ice Ko to promote the LIFS peer mentoring program and the LIFS Professional Development Workshop. and emphasised on time management + being professional (though I dunno how using 45 minues to talk about another program during an interview is considered as a professional interviewer)<br /><br />BTW no information about the Wetland Practicum course will be obtained through the interview. at least in my case.",

All the volunteers and staff are very professional and knowledgeable.<br /><br /># Meetings with Ice Ko<br />A waste of time repeating what is good about the LIFS peer mentoring and LIFS professional development workshop again and again even in front of the staff of wetland park when we are already late.<br /><br />Any questions about LIFS2011 will be answered as I don't know yet. <br /><br /># video editing/ shooting<br />Taught by Mr. Shek <br />a very knowledgeable, helpful, and nice teacher<br />We use Adobe Premiere Pro (LIFS department gave us money to buy it this year)<br /><br />Originally he will also teach us how to do video shooting in the park",
