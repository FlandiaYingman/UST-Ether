        "description": "The topic of aircraft design has always been a key part of the curriculum in aerospace engineering education. With constant expansion of aerospace industry driven by economic development, universities are required to better equip the students with knowledge and skills in design. The essence of design activities is to apply a variety of methods in an integrated manner, in order to produce design solutions which meet a set of objectives and constraints from technical, commercial, and social perspectives. This also need to be achieved in a schedule demanded by the customer, and within the specified budget, in order to maintain competitiveness against products from competitors. In this course, a set of advanced topics will be provided which complement what students would typically learn during studies at the undergraduate level. Students will be exposed to (1) principles, workflows and methods in multidisciplinary aircraft design practice, (2) concepts of some advanced engineering optimization methods and strategies, (3) some case studies used in industry design office or joint university-industry effort in research activities. At the end of the course, students will be able to formulate a conceptual aircraft optimization problem, build a variety of simulation models of various fidelity, and apply multi-objective optimization methods to solving the complex simulation-based design optimization problems.",
