        "description": "This course is a platform for entry-level engineer students to participate Chem-E-car competition, i.e. to design and construct a car powered by a chemical or biochemical energy source that will safely carry a specified load over a given distance and stop. The objective of this course is to develop the ability to control an electrochemical reaction, and to obtain hands-on experience on a practical engineering project, especially in chemical engineering field. Students will be given the opportunity to interact with each other, to integrate the learning experience to design and build a device, and chances to prepare for starting their future career in engineering. It is a student-led project, designed to motivate students for engineers. Graded DI/PA/F. Enrollment in the project course require instructor's approval.",
