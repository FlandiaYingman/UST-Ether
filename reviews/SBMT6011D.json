        "description": "Applied Statistics is a tool that can be used in a variety of business settings, but despite the widespread discussion of terms like Business Intelligence, the truth is that these areas are actually not very well understood. Advances in computing power can now give businesses ways to analyze data that they never could before. This course examines with these advances, how firms can make decisions about pricing, marketing, new products, and resource allocation more effectively than they have ever been able to in the past.",
