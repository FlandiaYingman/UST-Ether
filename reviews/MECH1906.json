            "comment_content": "It is long, but read carefully. Trust me.<br /><br />Believe it or not, a lot of content from the lecture PowerPoint slides are copied directly from the internet, sources including Wikipedia and lecture notes from other universities. That is very unprofessional and disappointing.<br /><br />If we put aside the fact that the content is plagiarized, the PowerPoint slides themselves are still no good. There are 40+ pages of PowerPoint slides per lesson. The contents are overwhelming and unnecessarily in-depth. One example is when we were learning about metals, we were taught that they can be classified into ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and super alloys. Fair enough. Then each classifications have a couple of sub-classifications, such as ferrous metals can be divided into cast iron and steels. Then we even have to learn about the sub-classifications of the sub-classifications. (e.g. Steels can be divided into carbon steels, alloy steels, high-strength low-alloy steels, stainless steels etc.) I don’t see the need to learn all that in an introductory course.",

I still believe this is a poor course no matter if my final grade is an A+ or an F.<br /><br />From what I heard, it’s not too difficult to get a good grade. You will get a good grade if you are good at memorizing. But it’s pathetic to see that education is reduced to the ability to memorize facts.",
            "comment_workload": "No quizzes, tests, assignments, projects, homework. A very good course to take if you don’t care about learning and want a good grade with minimal effort. Only one mid-term exam and one final exam, all MC questions. <br /><br />This brings up another problem. The exam questions are just as poor as the PowerPoint slides. You will see MC questions with more than one correct options / no correct options, but you’ll be told it's your own problem if you raise any question during the exam.",

This means at the end you just copy content in the PP to the cheat sheet and take the exam.<br />The assignments are mostly copying from the PP with some simple calculations. However, some questions from the assignments are worded very weirdly, with some very specific nouns altered to be different from the PP, which makes it pretty confusing.",

So if you understand the steps you'll be more than ready for the exams.<br /><br />There isn't any attendance.",
            "comment_teaching": "Pretty boring. Just reading the lecture slides and on some occasions adding examples to supplement what she's teaching, so reading the lecture slides yourself is a much more efficient way to use your time. However, during the times I was in class the professor was always willing to answer any questions that came at the end of the class.",
            "comment_grading": "Like I mentioned above, just reading the lecture notes is more than enough to do well in this course so the mean is fairly high (around the high 80s for assignments and exams). If you want to obtain high grades just try to familiarise yourself with everything mentioned in the lecture slides, especially the examples given for calculation questions. <br /><br />This term our grades were determined by this weighting: <br />assignments (20%)<br />mid-terms (35%) covering lectures 3-12<br />finals (45%) covering lectures 13-24<br /><br />the mid-terms and finals this semester were mostly MCs and 5 short answer questions involving basic calculations.<br /><br />It's fairly easy to obtain satisfactory grades for your assignments as most of the answers are directly from the lecture notes. Also for the midterms and finals you could bring your own cheat sheet.",
            "comment_workload": "In terms of assignments, the workload is very light. You're only given 1 assignment per module and you have a sufficient amount of time to complete it. Also most of the answers could be found on the lecture slides. <br /><br />I would give this rating an A, but after the mid-terms the content covered in lectures was uncalled for. EVERY SINGLE LECTURE AFTER THE MIDTERMS PRACTICALLY DOUBLED IN LENGTH. So that was a lot of catching up to do.",

Nevertheless, you can still ask the professors more about that topic during or after the lectures if you want to know more, generally, the professors are quite nice.<br /><br />Lecture topics:<br />1. engineering ethics<br />2. introduction to aerospace engineering<br />3. introduction to aerodynamics<br />4. propulsion<br />5. gas turbines<br />6. gas turbines<br />7. statics and dynamics<br />8. solid mechanics<br />9. engineering materials<br />10. metals<br />11. polymers<br />12. control<br />13. robotics<br />14. design<br />15. manufacturing<br />16. mechanism of machinery<br />17. micro-electro-mechanical systems<br />18. thermodynamics<br />19. heat transfer<br />20. fluid mechanics<br />21. energy<br />22. building",

And we are allowed to prepare a piece of cheat sheet, A4 and both sides, and bring it to the room or hall of the exam.<br /><br />All in all, the course is quite easy as long as you have read the notes and know what is going on, the knowledge is not that difficult to understand<br />I get an A- in the end",

The homework is pretty easy because you can basically just search the slides and copy the words from them, and you can get almost full mark. For the mid-term and the final, a double-sided A4 cheat sheet is allowed. Basically, you can just copy literally everything from all slides for preparation. It takes time, but trust me, this is very helpful.",

The assignments are easy to finish as I mentioned in the grading part. Each of them will take you about less than one hour to finish. Besides, there are 4 in-class quizzes, which consist of 10 MC questions each. The questions are easy so you don't need to take too much time for revising. <br /><br />Therefore, although the course is pretty boring it is easy to learn and get satisfactory grades.",

            "comment_teaching": "7 professors are in charge of this course, contributing to different topics. Overall, the teaching is appropriate and adequate but one may prefer to study by oneself by looking at the lecture slides and asking questions to the TAs, instead.",
            "comment_grading": "I think the gradings are pretty generous, especially for the assignments. If your answers contain some information which answers the question, you will get a point easily. So in your assignments, try to find as much information from the lecture slides that could possibly be used to answer the question. The mid and final terms also depend on how well you memorize information from the lecture slides and from external research you did while you completed the assignments. However, in general, the gradings are fair and it is not hard to get a good grade throughout the course.",

His powerpoints contain a great amount of materials copied directly from online pages. For other lecturers, since the topics they teach are also not the most interesting, it is hard to maintain attentiveness.<br /><br />You don't have to show up in the lessons. The extreme case is that you can simply ditch all the lessons and read the powerpoints on your own. They are not that complicated to understand, except the physics formulas part which may be slightly challenging for those without a good math/physics background. Good thing is they seldomly appear in your homework and exams.",

For the first 2 assignments without open-ended questions, the mean is around 95, but it dropped to around 90 once there are more of those questions.<br /><br />Final marks were unknown but I was extra careful in answering the questions and I wrote in long paragraphs.",

Fortunately, it will not take too long.<br /><br />For both the midterm and finals, you can bring a 2-sided A4 cheatsheet. Many people wrote as small as possible to cram every factual stuff from the lecture powerpoints. However, most of the questions can be answered without frequent referral to your cheatsheet.

            "comment_content": "This course is probably highly recommended by SENG for first-year inductees who are deciding on a major. <br /><br />The course covers four modules, each one containing 4-6 lectures' worth of information, with an accompanying assignment (3-5 pages, 65% MC, 35% FRQ) near its conclusion. Each module will introduce students to an important aspect of mechanical engineering and covers each subject with satisfying detail. Concepts are not difficult to grasp but may be overwhelming if one attempts to cram. <br /><br />Though the course provides an introduction to mechanical engineering, there is nothing in the course that is essential to your progression in the said major. Nevertheless, it is an adequate eye-opener to the courses you will take should you declare the major.",
            "comment_teaching": "There are a total of 7 module instructors, 2 teaching assistants and 1 course coordinator (Prof. Hong Tao) responsible for the direction and delivery of the course's content and lectures. Each lecturer is highly knowledgeable about the content they deliver, but they generally do not offer anything outside of reading off the lecture notes.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading policy:<br /><br />Assignments (4): 20%<br />Mid-term exam (1): 40%<br />Final exam (1): 40%<br /><br />This is arguably favourable.",
            "comment_workload": "As mentioned, lecturers generally read off the lecture slides without providing much additional input during class. Because these lecture notes are provided online and *are the only references provided that are relevant to the scope of the class*, it is feasible to study the lecture notes oneself in lieu of attending the lecture itself; indeed, many have found this a much wiser use of their time and as such the current present/enrolled ratio has dwindled to an embarrassing low. <br /><br />Besides going over the study notes, you will have four assignments, each due after the last lecture in that module has been delivered. The answers to most of the questions in the assignments are directly found from the lecture notes, with very little calculations, so if one is familiar with the contents of the module, the assignments will be very simple indeed.<br /><br />You will also face two examinations, the mid-term and the final. You are allowed a handwritten, one-sided A4 cheat sheet for the mid-term. The mid-term exam is fairly straightforward. You will recognise many questions from the assignments, so if you did your assignments with good knowledge of the information in the modules, the mid-term will be easy to handle.<br />(Time of writing is prior to the final, so no information can be provided for the final exam, but if editable this will be updated.)",

I didn't enjoy studying this course at all. <br /><br />If you are only taking this course as a common core course for sciences, unless you are an expert on memorisation, or you like memorising, I would not recommend you to take this course.

To me taking the lecture is just a waste of time. <br /><br />The slides did help a bit since it's exactly the exam material, but I don't think it actually helped on deepening our understandings.

He even laughs at students who have 2 exams or more on the same day, saying &quot;that's life&quot; with a giggle.<br /><br />The only good thing about him is that he is open to any questions and will answer them.

            "comment_workload": "You do not have any assignments, homework, exercises and whatsoever to do at all. <br /><br />However, when the exam approaches, you will suffer as there is just too much stuff to memorize. Please note that most of the powerpoints are 40-70 slides long.<br /><br />You might ask if there are ways to reduce the workload before the exams. But as only pure memorization is required, there are not many things you can do (like starting to study earlier will not help as you end up forgetting the stuff before the exams). Understanding does not guarantee any grade boost.<br /><br />So just try your best and study (memorize). Thinking about all the unfortunate students who have registered this course with you might give you some comfort.",

This is a shitty introduction course through and through.<br /><br />Every introduction course tries to touch on every aspect of the subject, and as a result never go into depth on anything. This ends up with the student learning a bunch of worthless trivia about shear stress or something, and never really going into depth about the mechanics and the maths about the subject. If you're a freshman, know this: DO NOT TAKE INTRO COURSES UNLESS YOU NEED THEM. INTRO COURSES ARE COMPLETELY POINTLESS.",

Many of such are too detailed / unnecessary to be covered in an &quot;introductory&quot; course. This course probably is one of the worst courses in terms of content design.<br /><br />Occasionally he invites other professors skilled in a particular area to teach in one or two particular lectures.

Cramming all of it in your brain in one go simply won't work unless you have photogrpahic memory (Oh how much I wished I had photographic memory when I was studying for this course). Reading through the lecture notes over and over again will pretty much sum up the workload. It's not hard, but it's something that requries dedication. There are some tricky questions in the exams, so memorising word-by-word is essential. But you can skip some notes and still pull off an A+, so it's all good.",

The course does achieve this, in that the content is basic, and does not require any previous knowledge in the subject. However, it remains at a very basic level throughout the semester, as it tries to introduce a new topic every lecture and therefore is never able to create depth. Therefore, at most the content would make you curious about those topics and search them up in your free time.",
