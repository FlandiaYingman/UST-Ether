        "description": "Contract law with the laws of tort and unjust enrichment constitutes the “law of obligations”. It plays an important part of everyday life for individuals, businesses and even public agencies. Knowledge of contract law is imperative in a variety of practical dispute resolution and problem solving contexts. This course will guide students to examine the law of contract in England and Wales, drawing on materials from other jurisdictions (particularly Hong Kong). Topics include enforceability of agreements; terms of contracts; exception clauses, limitation clauses and unfair terms; misrepresentation; mistake and frustration; duress, undue influence and unconscionable bargains; and remedies. The course will put emphasis on applying the rules, principles and concepts of contract law to real-life cases with practical\nconsequences and contextualizing the law in different settings. Good command of English Language is required to deal with legal readings. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
