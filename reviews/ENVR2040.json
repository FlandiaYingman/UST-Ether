        "description": "In today's world more and more marketing claims promise \"green\" and \"eco-friendly\" products. Yet, to interpret how \"green\" a product is, or how a product's environmental performance can be improved, one needs to consider all environmental impacts that occur along the product's life-cycle. This class is for students to gain an overview of environmental impacts of products and production systems and how they can be quantified through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In this course, we will explore relevant concepts and provide training in LCA software, equipping students with foundational skills which can be applied to their own projects in the future. The class also aims to explore how lifecycle thinking and LCA can contribute to a shift towards a circular economy.",
