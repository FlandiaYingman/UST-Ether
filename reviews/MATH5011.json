No homework. <br />Originally there is a final presentation, but since Nov. stuff, he asked us to learn Fourier transf. and distribution theory at home and do a problem as final. He also asked us to hand in lecture notes that we took down in class.<br />I didnt know how to solve that problem so only submitted the notes. and got an A!!<br />OMG! He's so generous.",

If you are a perfectionist, you would find it frustrating that in HW1 and 2, there is a question that requires you to either read a whole chapter of other reference book or an original research paper. You definitely need a month to do that particular part, which I am not interested since my interest is not in real analysis. However, if you choose to neglect this question, you can find the solution of other questions online, and the professor encourage us to do so. In either case you need to type the homework in Latex, which I was not that familiar with.<br /><br />The final exam only covers Chapter 1 and 2, despite that he taught up to Chapter 3.<br /><br />Overall the workload is B for some of us, D for some others, and so I would give an average C.",
