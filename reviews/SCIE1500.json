Try not to leave these essays to the last minute (this may be hard if a professor whose research field you really like gives their lecture right before the deadlines)<br /><br />The assignments require you to go far beyond the introduced ideas in the lecture. Start with reading some of the professor's research papers (get them from the links/citations in their own webpage), and then go onto Google Scholar, JSTOR, Web of Science, or other databases to find research papers related to the professor's.

Actually, if you are not interested in doing research, I believe you will find this course very boring even though the professors teach very well. <br /><br />From my experience, all of the professors are willing to answer any question from students, and some are even willing to meet students individually if they want to join the research project",

I got A+ at the end and I think the grading of this course is good. If you do the assignments seriously and attend one seminar per week, I think it is easy to get an A. Which is reasonable if you read the workload part later.",
            "comment_workload": "I think this part depends on whether you are interested in research or not again. For both of the assignments, you will need to write an essay (around 1000 words) to sum up what the professors have presented during one of the seminars that you choose. You also need to read more literature to extend what the professors have talked about. Finally, the reflection and inspiration from yourself.<br /><br />To be honest, as just a year one student it is a bit tough for me to look up 10+ literature for one assignment. And as the literature assumes the readers know all the background knowledge required, I need to spend tons of time trying to understand the background knowledge in order to get a clue what is happening in the literature. Some what's happening when I am doing the assignment is that I read literature and I find some terminology that I don't know. Then I look up the explanation for that terminology and I find more terminology that I don't know and so on and so on. It would be a hell of continuous suffering if you are not really interested in the topic. <br /><br />On the other way round, if you are interested in the topic, you will really learn a lot when you are reading more literature about the research topic. Actually, I think I enjoy the progress that I am preparing and writing this essay even though some of the topics are difficult. For each assignment, I spend nearly a week with a total of around 10-20 hours. It would be better if you start earlier and do not be a deadline fighter.",
