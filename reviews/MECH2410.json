The important thing is the curve of internal energy between atoms.<br />Then the next part is related to some solid mechanics, such as stress&amp;strain. Then failure/fracture was also introduced.<br />The phase diagram and the TTT diagram in the later part of the courses are extremely important, so please study hard and pay attention in these parts.<br />Overall, it is an interesting but demanding courses, in which the workload will be addressed later.",

Phase Diagram<br />Among these chapters, most of the contents in chapter 2 were related to DSE Physics Elective (Atomic World) and (to a lesser extent) Chemistry. Chapter 4 on the other hand covered part of the contents taught in MECH2040.<br /><br />In general, the contents before the midterm is easier than those taught after the midterm, though the contents were generally straight forward. I found that perhaps due to limited teaching time at the end, Chapter 8 was more difficult to understand. Besides, mastering sufficient problem-solving skills is another question though. So buying the textbook is recommended, given by the TA's problematic teaching.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Sherry Chen's teaching is clear and lively, if not impeccable. While I'm not sure whether she is a local instructor (who studied in Mainland China) or from Mainland China, her teaching was fluent, so misunderstanding due to accent wasn't a problem.<br /><br />Professor Chen also made good use of analogy, such as when teaching screw dislocations within crystals, she used ramps inside multi-storey parking lots to describe such structure. For concepts, she may also remind us that these may appear in quizzes/exams. Sometimes during lectures she may also include brief information about future academic and career development.<br /><br />The TA, Xu Junjun, was another story though. During her tutorials, she basically only repeated what Professor Chen taught, along with some concept questions. Very limited examples were provided to us for practice. With heavy Chinese accent (that hampered understanding), she also have problems in explaining concepts. I barely grasped the way to locate slip planes and directions she taught us on tutorials.<br /><br />In general, A for Sherry Chen's teaching, D for the TA, so an overall B.",

Asking the professor would be a good idea in such case. The virtual labs were easy, to the point that many students attained full marks for both of them.<br /><br />As mentioned before the quizzes contained conceptual MC questions. In general if you attended the lectures and studied the contents, you should be able to find hints or even explicit answers from lecture notes.<br /><br />The midterm, which lasted for 30 minutes, was mainly MC with a few (I think no more than 4) calculation questions. The questions were easy and straightforward, so I got an over-the-mean score.<br /><br />The take-home final though was another story though. Divided into 2 parts, Part 1 (lasted for 30 minutes) contained MC and short questions, approximately at 1:1 ratio. If you stuck at one question, you lose valuable time in tackling other questions, especially more time-consuming calculation short questions. Part 2 (also lasted for 30 minutes) contained 2 composite questions, all of them were significantly different from assignment questions. Doing Peter Gao's past paper should better prepare you for the course's composite questions.<br /><br />When preparing for MECH2410 I thought the difficulty should be similar to the midterm, so I spent more effort on other courses and neglected MECH2410. This has been proved fail deadly per my disastrous final score.<br /><br />That said, thanks to the course's balanced grading, at the end I get a B.",

Professor Chen usually informed us the quizzes before 1 lecture. <br /><br />Normally we should have lab sessions at 6pm for some Mondays, but due to COVID, all have been changed to virtual lab, in which we watched videos and fill in MC questions.",

This course will be focused on metallic materials.<br />By the end of this course,you should be able to:(i)Analyze and explain certain simple everyday materials behavior;(ii)Explain the basis of certain materials physical properties, such as density,mechanical strength,ductility,etc.,based on the atomic&amp;micro-structure;(iii)Explain the relationship of processing with mechanical properties,strength,ductility,toughness,etc.(iv)To identify engineering materials suitable for a given engineering applications",
