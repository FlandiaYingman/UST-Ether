            "comment_content": "The first thing that I would like to say is that even non-BAFS students, like me, can handle this, though those who studied BAFS in DSE would definitely gain some advantage. So don't feel sad even if you're a non-accounting high school student!<br /><br />This course covers some basic concepts for accounting, such as four financial statements and components. I believe other people from the forum has already copy and pasted the info, so I won't do it here.",
            "comment_teaching": "Sorry for the upcoming rambling guys, I just want to tell you how awful he is!!!!! <br /><br />Dennis is not bad in teaching. He does teach us something, and his English is proficient compared to other prof. Rather, I often found Dennis being utterly rude, which really affected the learning atmosphere. Many people in this page praised Dennis for being a great teacher and you'll probably think I'm just a 打手 who got a bad grade (though merely an A-). So allow me to explain.<br /><br />Dennis Chan is an impatient, strict and stubborn man who gets all-defensive easily, which often put me and my classmates off. One time I asked about why my classwork was deducted by 30% in a neutral manner, &amp; he responded with a very long message condemning me about not reading the guidelines... To be frank, I did not intentionally put my full name in wrong order, and that you didn't write in the rules that the order is to be put right, but merely 'full name as stated in student ID card'. Both of us have the responsibility to fix the issue, and besides, it is my grading that is affected, but not yours. There is no reason for him to be so angry :)<br /><br />Second, he loses patience easily when you ask him more questions in depth, and it often feels like he is angry with students. After such undesirable experience with him, I just feel frightened whenever I ask him something via email. (Ironically, he only smiles and nods with know-it-all non-locals who interrupts in the middle of his sentence and raise questions.) I really wanted to learn more about the accounting mechanics, but unfortunately Dennis is not the prof that I should ask for.<br /><br />Third, he sometimes puts up classwork that are not even mentioned in class (he mentioned compensation expenses, but not the whole procedure). This is totally unfair to those who are willing to learn but don't have related knowledge, compared to those who had learnt such in high school ! By the way, his policy of having sudden quizzes at the end of some classes without prior notice makes me really nervous. But I guess it's just my problem lol<br /><br />Lastly, remember to preview the slides before lectures because he assumes us to already know something about the concepts and thus will not explain the basic ideas. For instance, he won't tell you what a 'write-off' is, and he just jumps right into the journal entry steps, assuming that you already know it. He only kept giving us trivia that are only useful when you get the gist of the content/ want to get into accounting major.",
            "comment_grading": "update: Eventually an A- for this course. <br /><br />We got 8 classwork, <br />3 homework assignments &amp; <br />a final assessment with 50 questions that are to be completed in 60 minutes. <br />The grading policy is super intransparent. He gives no details after the finals.<br /><br />By the way, don't, and NEVER, ask Dennis about grading policies (absolute/relative, request for paper-checking), whether via email or in person. Otherwise, be prepared to be scolded by him :)))",
            "comment_workload": "homework and classwork assignments are mostly done on MH connect, an online website that gives you access to our e-book (though most of us don't read it as it's lengthy) and online assignments.<br /><br />The workload is not that heavy -- no mandatory readings or questions, but only several open-book online assignments during class (meaning, you have to attend classes even there's no attendance) as well as homework. But these are okay as it also helps you consolidate concepts that you've learnt in class. <br /><br />Homework assignments are more time-consuming - it requires us to do a full accounting process. The third one regarding inventory systems was the hardest. I used like 3-4 hours cumulatively to complete it.",

It is extremely hard for non-BAFS students to catch up since the chapters are arranged in a weird position in my own opinion. <br /><br />I think one of the chapters regarding adjusting entries is the hardest to catch up. This chapter requires students with no accounting foundation to categorize different items, and this consumes much effort. However, for some chapters after the final, the chapter summary actually clashes with the above chapter on adjusting entries to a large extent.<br /><br />Generally speaking, I saw my friends getting almost full marks when they have studied accounting before. This is very frustrating for students like me.",
            "comment_teaching": "Kelvin tends to use a lot of local Hong Kong shops as examples in classes, and even in Cantonese sometimes, which may be difficult for some non-local students to understand.<br /><br />He also loves using many technical terms and specific accounting terms, before explaining them clearly before using them. It is easy for me to lose track of what he is talking about and soon I found myself falling behind and not understanding the following lecture materials even more. <br /><br />He tends to do many examples using draft paper and youtube videos in the lesson, it may be beneficial to students who understand him, but not to students who found it confusing on all the calculations which he ASSUMES we should know .<br /><br />His powerpoint only highlight the important point without explaining the rationale behind, so it is hard to understand without reading the materials in textbooks. <br /><br />There are no lecture videos provided.",

Plus, as long as you have submitted the exercises you will gain full credit for that column. 10 In-Class Exercises throughout the semester but only 8 were required.<br /><br />There is only one class in the whole semester that requires your attendance. You have to answer a designated question in that class to get that 6% participation marks. A file that shows which day you have to go to class will be released after add-drop period.<br /><br />Quiz 1 is very easy, just the very basics. The mean was approximately 28.2 out of 32. Quiz 2 is slightly more difficult but the mean was still 72/84.<br /><br />BUT! The final exam is simply a pain in the arse. It is very difficult. An A4-sized, double-sided cheat sheet is allowed to be brought into the exam but you won't need to even have a glimpse on it, at least for me. The mean of the exam was 78/150 and the s.d. was 22.<br /><br />I believe the mean grade is B.<br />Even my Quiz 2 score was more than 1 s.d. below mean and my final exam score was within 0.5 s.d. below mean I can still get a B-. Can't blame anyone for that grade because I stupidly gave up this course.<br /><br />Not the greatest but certainly better than a number of courses out there.",

            "comment_content": "Basically this course will teach you the 4 fundamental financial statements with a thorough curriculum. The content is definitely quite complicated, especially for people who did not take any accounting subjects before. HOWEVER, I heard that a lot of non-locals always thought that locals would have an advantage in the course since they had taken accounting before. Allow me to clear up this misconception that this is not always the case. There are still a lot of local students who did not take accounting before (it is an ELECTIVE subject called BAFS under Hong Kong's high school curriculum). And I am one of those people. So I am just like those people who did not know ANYTHING about accounting until taking this course. To fully understand what Dennis said, I had to revise the notes, ask questions, do textbook exercises for countless times and it ended up an endless cycle until final. SO, instead of going on complaining you are in a so-called 'disadvantageous' position, why don't you turn it into motivation by working 10x harder than others?",
            "comment_teaching": "People say Dennis teaches well but I can only partially agree. Yes, he can deliver what he wants to say in a quite straightforward way, but the fact that he speaks too fast while cramming students with a bunch of seemingly useful info often confuses me. It makes me fail to jot down everything he says and understand what the lecture notes mean (becos Dennis will always provide additional details in class). Also, he will NOT provide any paper review session of no matter mid term or final. This is so unfair to students whose marks in mid term are not satisfactory, because even if they wish to learn from their mistakes, they CANNOT. Being said so, he will answer your questions via email in a prompt manner. So be prepared to ask questions frequently if you wish to perform well.",

I already did not know how to do the very first questions, and I just randomly picked the answers when I knew the time was running out. So... good luck.<br />Got an A in the end. Honestly I was expecting to get B- cos I thought I messed up the final - And also the very low transparency of the course. So I felt really lucky for it. Thank god.",

I discussed with a friend numerous times before we figured out the most appropriate answers, not to mention if you try to finish it all by yourself.",

Honestly speaking, they should be part of our common knowledge but I just ignored them during that lesson and wrote them down in my cheat sheet. Just do so if you don't think you need to know these facts.<br /><br />According to other posts all the contents are included in BAFS in HKDSE so it will be a huge advantage to those who have taken BAFS before.<br /><br /> Well, it may be somehow correct but as one who had no any business background, I think it doesn't matter. Everything is basic concept and Wilbur did not test some very complicated concept nor some concept that he did not mention before (although there are some in the homework but that's all due to the publisher). Therefore, based on my experience, just listen to his lecture and do some exercises in the textbook as practice can save your life. <br /><br />Attendance is taken but you just have to answer some pulling questions online. ( P.S. If you have friend with you, just ask them send you the code or even ask them to answer the questions for you using another device will be fine) However, it is strongly advised that you should take the lesson especially if you have no background before. The pulling questions always helped me to clarify my concept so I think it will be helpful if you do them yourself.<br /><br />Homework are not difficult and have UNLIMITED attempts which means that you can get all 20%. However, I don't think homework can help your exams so extra self-exercises are needed if you want to get good grades.<br /><br />Midterm was terrible (mean is about 60% after adjustment) which forced Wilbur to add 20 marks for everyone ( it seems that upper quartile was 8X after adjustment) . Final was terriblly easy when compared to midterm and those from all other professors <br />(maybe Wilbur did so because of the midterm). However, no marks was released even when grade is given. I think Wilbur will make better adjustment on the difficulties later on so good luck.",

You can do it within 1.5 hours while the exam time was 3 hours. I am quite sure Wilbur being a new professor is one of the reasons for the unreasonable difficulties.

Below are the detailed contents:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Introducing accounting statements<br />Chapter 2: Investing decisions and financing decisions and the accounting system<br />Chapter 3: Income statement and some operating decisions<br />Chapter 4: Adjustments, financial statements, and the quality of earnings<br />Chapter 5: Interpreting financial information<br />Chapter 6: Sales revenue, receivables, and bad debt<br />Chapter 7: Costs of goods sold and inventory<br />Chapter 8: Property, plant, and equipment<br />Chapter 9: Reporting liabilities &amp; bonds<br />Chapter 10: Reporting bond securities<br />Chapter 11: Reporting and interpreting stockholders' equity<br />Chapter 12: Statement of cash flow <br />Chapter 13: Financial statement analysis (Did not cover in this semester)<br /><br />The content is mostly covered in the senior secondary if you have taken accounting before. Hence that would be simple for those who had studied accounting-related subjects before.<br /><br />For those who didn't take those subjects before, GOOD LUCK. As one of them, my suggestion is to spend one or two hours every week to dig deep into the practices. This could really help in your final.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Tang is much appreciated. He is a very passionate tutor. With every lecture, you could feel his passion for accounting. <br /><br />His accents are clear without any of the Chinese accents. Besides, he seldom overrun his lectures. <br /><br />He is also welcome to any kinds of questions. Since zoom lecturing is adopted this semester, he disabled the chatroom function as well. Therefore, you may need to open your mic and ask him directly. However, he is welcome to answer your questions.",

You could get all 5% if you answer all the questions, no matter you are correct or not. There are various types of questions, including some true or false, concept checks, and calculations. <br /><br />Prof Tang would release the answer of the in-class polling later on. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND looking back at those questions as they are similar to the type of questions that would exist in the final.<br /><br />Homework:<br />Please look at the workload part thanks.<br /><br />Quizzes:<br />Please look at the workload part as well. However, best 4 out of 5 quizzes will be selected for the score for quizzes.<br /><br />Final:<br />I give his grading a C because HIS FINAL IS HARD AS HELL!. The type of questions that exist in the lecture notes and homework is totally different to those in the finals...<br /><br />The length of each question is much longer than before. It is very challenging to finish all questions in time. The question type includes:<br />True or false<br />Selecting correct/ false statements<br />Calculation (Type-in)<br /><br />As the calculations require you to type in the answer. You literally have no chance to make a guess...<br /><br />Finally, I got only 30/100 at ate a C.<br /><br />However, I still appreciate prof Tang effort and assistance in this course.",

You should not few much stress and tension.<br /><br />Also, as a non-business student aiming to minor in business, this would be a helpful course as you may acquire some basic accounting skills useful in your future.<br /><br />The workload is as follows:<br />5 Quizzes<br />4 Homework<br /><br />Quizzes:<br />Held throughout the semester every 2-3 weeks. The contents are simple. Around 20 questions in which half of which are true or false questions. One-forth is checking correct/false statements. The remainings are calculations. If you keep up the steps with the prof you should get a mean score. <br /><br />Homework:<br />A bit challenging. At the start of the semester, prof Tang only allowed 2 attempts for each assignment. Then he changed to unlimited attempts after he received some reflections from the students. <br /><br />Therefore, you should be able to get a full score in this part.",

I read many reviews praising his teaching but it seems like Dennis in real life and his reviews show different styles and personalities. When I took his class, I would often find myself confused despite paying attention and trying my best to comprehend the materials. Dennis would often cram us with useless trivia that only someone who wishes to be an accountant would be interested in. The trivia would not be examined but I didn't know that at first. This led to me memorizing a lot of meaningless information. I also find Dennis quite rude to students. He wouldn't really be willing to answer questions through email and I saw him once scoff at a student when he asked the professor a question after class ended. It was a mostly negative experience being taught by Dennis. I recommend him to replace offering useless trivia with using real life examples to illustrate concepts and ideas.",

            "comment_teaching": "Before I start I just want to preface by saying that I got an -A in the end, which I was quite happy with all things considered, and I am not writing this review in an attempt to &quot;get back at him&quot; for giving me a poor grade. <br /><br />There seems to be quite a big divide in opinions when it comes to Dennis. Some students seem to love him and enjoy his harsh style of teaching, but a lot of other students find him unnecessarily mean and defensive when it comes to answering questions and grading. I am definitely in the second group.<br /><br />He takes away 30% of your grade for all online classwork where your name is not shown correctly, and this could be even as minor as putting your first name before your last name (e.g. first name, SURNAME would be INCORRECT and it must be SURNAME, First name). When I sent a kindly-worded email asking why my classwork had been deducted, he sent a really long email reprimanding me for not paying attention to his classwork rules (which by the way do not mention anything about the order of your name). On top of this, he never really fully answers any questions in class (plus he often gets kind of annoyed at students especially when the question is a little more complex), and if you email him with a question, he will literally respond with one-word answers. Lastly, he always seems to be rushing through the material, and he constantly gives you a ton of extra information that is only useful to students who take accounting as their major (which I do not)<br /><br />Overall, I had a really negative experience with Dennis as my professor over the entire course. Although I was genuinely interested in the material, I found it really hard to concentrate during the lessons because I would be a bit nervous about the classwork which he springs on you every few lectures. <br /><br />(Please bear in mind that this review might be a bit biased because I really didn't like him or his teaching practices from the beginning of the course, as the 30% deduction thing really annoyed me. Still, I would recommend that you think twice before taking any of his courses.)",
            "comment_grading": "As I said, I got an -A overall which to be honest I was pretty happy with considering how many marks he took off my classwork.<br /><br />Although I am happy with my grade, I still think the marking for this course is borderline unethical for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. He will never let you check how are why you got something wrong in a homework task.<br />2. Sometimes the classwork asks about topics that we haven't even studied before (and for people who didn't do any accounting at high-school level this is really annoying).<br />3. The removal of 30% of your grade for not putting your name in his preferred order is perhaps the most ludicrous rule I have ever heard. <br /><br />Because of all of this, you could really end up with a grade that does not reflect your actual knowledge of the topic.",
            "comment_workload": "Pretty standard. You have to do work by yourself because he doesn't actually teach much and expects you to know everything anyway. I will say that the textbook he provided us with was pretty good.",

            "comment_content": "An introductory course for accounting that covers the 4 financial statements and how to record different items under different circumstances. I do not like how rigid and strict accounting is so I did not find the course very captivating. The concepts are not difficult to memorize and understand individually but there is a lot to remember in total.<br /><br />For details on the topics covered, please refer to the attached course syllabus.<br /><br />My overall comments for this course are as follows: You can safely get a lot of points from group exercises and assignments (also quizzes but depends on how much effort you pay). You should choose her if you only want to secure a decent score. You shouldn't choose her if you want to have a higher chance of getting a high grade (Prof Chen says only a few students got in A-range in her class)<br />Most suitable for people who have studied accounting before (economics does NOT help at all).",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Chen adopts a blended-learning teaching arrangement, where students watch pre-recorded videos for each chapter (around 15-20 mins) as pre-study at home and she will go through some questions and examples in lessons (which are not compulsory as she claims). It is an acceptable arrangement. However, I think she does not explain enough concepts to students. If you do not have an accounting background (i.e. haven't studied accounting before in high school or somewhere else), this course may be a little tough for you to get on given the rapid pace (details in the 'WORKLOAD&quot; section)<br /><br />She utilizes the discussion section of Canvas well by setting up a discussion chat for questions to be answered on or before each lesson. She usually answers by directly replying to the Canvas discussion chat. She is responsive and tries her best to leave no questions unanswered (unless she forgot and you have to remind her).<br /><br />One good thing about Prof. Chen's class is that she gives us a lot of additional exercises to complete (completely optional) so we have plenty of exercises. There is also a Smart Book Reading on McGraw-Hill Connect which can show you the respective concept covered in the question you did from the textbook.<br /><br />Lessons with quizzes are compulsory. She sets a passcode to access the online quiz so you must be present to get it. Although lessons without quizzes are optional, something troublesome is that Zoom recordings need to be requested if you want to watch them. I attended all lessons so it didn't affect me.<br /><br />The TA (LEE, Sapere KK) only appeared in one of the pre-study videos and in an announcement or two so we never actually met her. I have no comment for this TA since she is next to non-existent.",
            "comment_grading": "Interactions and discussions 3% <br />In-class group exercises (10 sessions) 22% <br />In-class quizzes (10 quizzes) 30% <br />Homework assignments (10 assignments) 20% <br />Final exam 25%<br /><br />The best part about the grading is that the daily marks take up a large proportion so you can claim a lot of marks here. The final exam takes up a lot less but it really should. Read on to know why.<br /><br />Interactions and discussions refer to answering questions during lessons and asking questions on Canvas discussion or in lessons. You get the full score by doing any of the above for 4 times.<br /><br />The content in group exercises is usually 50% in-syllabus and 50% out-syllabus and an article may have to be read. Professor Chen gives you the full mark as long as you finish it and submit it on time (mistakes will not deduct your score).<br /><br />Quizzes are done on a paid ebook platform called McGraw-Hill Connect (everyone must purchase it for ACCT2010) in closed-book format. Single-chapter quizzes usually consist of 4 MC and/or 'select all appropriate choices' questions. The quiz questions are claimed to be the 'basic' level and they are indeed mostly simple. Comprehensive quizzes have the same format but may include 'numerical response' questions (i.e. filling in the value of a computational question).<br /><br />Homework assignments are also done on McGraw-Hill Connect. Questions are usually filling in the blanks of financial statements according to the info given. 2 attempts are given so it is in your best interests to ask for all correct computational methods before your final attempt (everyone has the same questions but different numerical data).<br /><br />The final exam... is NOTHING LIKE THE usual quizzes and homework. It is split into 3 parts: basic, intermediate, and advanced. 'Basic' was 30 marks, 'Intermediate' was 76 marks, and 'Advanced' was 42 marks. The intermediate part was already too overwhelming for us since what we usually do are the basic-level questions. We were allowed to bring in 8-pages of cheat sheets, but even with them the final exam is a guaranteed FAIL. The same also occurs to students who get full marks in the quizzes. I hope Prof. Chen keeps her word and only allocates 25% to the final exam.<br /><br />There is a choice for us to shift at most 7% of our quiz scores to the final exam. Still, the decision has to be made before the final exam. After experiencing the final exam, I can say with certainty that you mustn't do that since your final may well be a disaster. <br /><br />All in all, the grading is decent if the final exam does not take up any more than 25%, so I will give it a B.<br /><br />The results for the final exam are unknown (in her latest announcement about our grade, she said 'The final exam grades will not be released in order to avoid unnecessary panic') but I know I got a B+ for my grade. You are recommended to refer to the Word file I attached which is the 'final exam' announcement from Prof. Chen to get a better idea of the grading.",

You have a consistent practice for ACCT2010 throughout the term if you prepare for quizzes seriously (then again, all my hard work didn't seem to be very effective in the final exam)<br /><br />All the extra exercises give us plenty of chances for practicing the basic-level questions.",

He spends about 3 weeks on the very basics of accounting. However, he rushed through the last chapters which should be considerably harder, thus will easily confuse students.<br /><br />2. His teachings is very inefficient. He always introduces new things even when he is teaching the basics in the beginning, thus it takes 3 weeks for the first two topics. For example, he suddenly introduces accruals when talking about chapter 2, when accruals are supposed to be chapter 3. Also, he talks a lot on irrelevant knowledge for the exam and also repeats several times every lesson. This pointless teachings along with lame annotations made his teaching dull and pointless. In fact, I skipped most of the lessons.<br /><br />3. He does not answer questions that much. Granted, he does answer questions in the lecture. However, there is one time when I send an email to him about my enquiries in chapter 12 (Cash Flow), the most recent topic, he neglected the email TWICE COMPLETELY. This is really ironic and intentional since not only I sent it twice, but I also got an immediate response right when I sent an email concerning about the exam format. This shows he is not really a reliable teacher that will answer every question.<br /><br />To give him some credits, He does provide extra lesson for those new to accounting.

To be honest, the mean should be higher if he could teach better, but many people are getting confused by his teachings. <br /><br />Since the final mark is still not publicized, I will only give some of my insights. The final for some reason addresses the questions topic-by-topic, starting from the last chapters to the first chapters in the exam syllabus (Note: The exam syllabus is not cumulative, from bad debts to cash flows) It is not particularly difficult but definitely harder than the Mid-term. There is much less time given to do the MCs while too much time for the LQs. In my experience, I have around 15 minutes left with the MCs but I have quite a number of them being uncertain.

It is about the 4 financial statement. First 2 months is mainly focusing on balance sheet and income statement. Last month would be cash flow statement with the help of the first 2.<br />A reminder: you need to understand the logic behind to avoid challenging questions. rote leaning is not suitable for you",
            "comment_teaching": "Boring but passionated. <br />Once I ask him so many questions through email, I thought he will reply me one by one. Instead of replying it one by one, he reserved a 1-to-1 zoom session for me at Sunday to answer my questions alongside providing me some sugesstions. It is rare in ust. <br />You must go to his lesson as it counts participation. I have to admit that I hate him at first as his lecture notes is not enough for you to understand what he said. You have to read the book yourself to follow him on lesson.<br />He tried to teach well but the scope does not allow. It is better to read yourself and watch back video if you don't understand. However, I do not encourage you to just use browser on lesson. Just try to understand what he said on lesson, maybe you can understand, he isn't that bad, just a dull tone.",
            "comment_grading": "As of now, I still haven't receive my final result. But I got an A-. I would not say it is good grade, but rather how hard you work how much you gain. I will explain my thought in below.<br />(Again see attachment for detail information)<br />My result: <br />Test 1: 167.55 / 200 (mean: 170; sd: 29.20) <br />Test 2: 238.85 / 270 (mean: 78.38% ; StDev: 14.85%)<br />Test 3: 299.2 / 300 (mean: 87% ; 14%)<br />Final: rot yet released<br /><br />Terry puts all hard homework questions as test and final problems, not even changing the number. Only a very few of the questions (i.e. 2 out of 30) are new questions, but they are not hard if you understand the other questions well. You can get a very nice grade even you have not study acct before. I am a non-bafs student and I stop study econ or math for one year b/c I chose retake. Even so, you can see my mark is progressing after every test.",
            "comment_workload": "Extremely heavy, as I give D even I get A-<br /><br />Reason for saying workload is heavy.<br />It is easy to see that it is heavy without comparison. 1) The total mark for all homework is 3330 and there are nearly 300 questions (including sub questions).<br />2) All questions are either hard or very hard. For concept questions, you must understand the whole session to get it correct. For factual questions, you at least have to read through the whole page to get the correct answer, sometimes you even need to click on the attachment or appendix to get the right answers.<br />3) Time is limited: Not that you are required to finish in few hours, but the total time allowed for one assignment is short. In other first year course, you have 2 weeks to finish one assignment. It is, however, not for terry's students. As he decide to put assignment after add/drop period, most assignment have to be finished in a rush. Usually 2 weeks for 2 assignment and the later one usually have 1 week only as he haven't teach. The last 3 assignments are crammed in 2 weeks. It is tough to finish it.<br />4) You cannot copy from internet: As aforementioned, he put homework questions in test. As a result, you need to digest it even you copy from chegg or course hero. It is more beneficial to do it yourself in my view.<br />5) Only 3 try. It is so different from other course and very pressured. You can understand it easily as homework accounts for 24% total mark as well as your test mark. I remember the mean for homework is 89 - 90% (not sure as he accidentally showed on lecture). You cannot form a team b/c u won't get any classmates help on zoom as he blocked the chat and there is no discussion time. <br />6) There are MC and long questions for homework. Long question is not easy than MC. Long questions are basically requiring you to do all the things you learnt and did in MC again. He wants to check your understanding. And some long questions are challenging that you can finish with book but not without book, which means you should revise them during the period you do homework.<br /><br />Period for 1 homework:<br />Minimum: 5 hour<br />Longest: 10 hour<br />Average: 7 hour <br />(It takes so long as I learnt while doing it as mentioned, I asked my acct friends and she said she tooks 3 hours for early chapter)<br /><br />Homework is one important factor that make its workload so heavy, but not the only one. Another one is practice questions. <br />Practice questions are very similar to homework. Terry will release homework first and then release answer for practice questions. Practice questions are after-book exercises. Those difficult after-book questions are your homework. If you want to get full in homework, you may want to do practice questions first and then use the method to check your homwork. It takes much lower time to finish practice problem as there are no MCs. <br />P.S. last chapter practice questions = final long questions.<br /><br />Would I say workload is heavy? Definitely. But is it such bad? No. You can learn much more than other class and you can control your grade by your effort. <br /><br />Recommedation: <br />1) not clever but willing to paid<br />2) clever and willing to paid<br />3) want to experience the felling of an accounting student",

Even you cannot get the correct answer, he still gives you majority of the marks given that you have written something meaningful :D<br /><br />His teaching is base on something called top-down approach. That is give the big picture first, then refines every detail (which is not suitable for me). Therefore, it is not a big problem if you don't know what he is talking about.

Many people in this page praised Dennis for being a great teacher and you'll probably think I'm just a 打手 who got a bad grade (though merely an A-). So allow me to explain.<br /><br />Dennis Chan is an impatient, strict and stubborn man who gets all-defensive easily, which often put me and my classmates off. One time I asked about why my classwork was deducted by 30% in a neutral manner, &amp; he responded with a very long message condemning me about not reading the guidelines... To be frank, I did not intentionally put my full name in wrong order, and that you didn't write in the rules that the order is to be put right, but merely 'full name as stated in student ID card'. Both of us have the responsibility to fix the issue, and besides, it is my grading that is affected, but not yours. There is no reason for him to be so angry :)<br /><br />Second, he loses patience easily when you ask him more questions in depth, and it often feels like he is angry with students. After such undesirable experience with him, I just feel frightened whenever I ask him something via email. (Ironically, he only smiles and nods with know-it-all non-locals who interrupts in the middle of his sentence and raise questions.)

After fully absorbing the course material, you are expected to:<br />1. know basic professional ethics of accounting<br />2. book journal entries (80% of this course, in different situations)<br />3. post the journal entries to a ledger<br />4. find useful information from 4 types of basic financial statements<br />5. construct simple financial statements (BS, IS, and Statement of Cash Flows)<br />The difficulty of the items above is ascending.<br /><br />I am a Mainland Gaokao student and I have no background in any business subjects. From my perspective, the course is newbie friendly and intellectually rewarding enough.",

Get mentally prepared for the final !!!<br />The MCs are long and need your clear knowledge with some intuition.<br />For long questions, Professor Tang will tell his students in advance what is going to be tested. You REALLY need to pay GREAT ATTENTION to this and do much exercise.<br />There is also a module of questions defined by Professor Tang called &quot;challenging question&quot;. This semester, the challenging questions are heavily associated with T-accounts, which is a great surprise to me and makes me feel like dying in the exam venue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I won't be surprised in the future if I hear someone in LG-1 cafeteria saying that &quot;Oh, Professor Tang put a WHOLE K-10 report into the appendix of his final paper this year.&quot; <br /><br />The grade is actually very good. I got full marks in homework, 98/100 in midterm, 4/5 (maybe) in attendance. The score of the final is not released. According to my estimation, I may get 40-70%, but I still got an A.

This is very different from other professors who assume you understand the basics and only teach those abstract concepts. I personally like his style though his lectures are a bit boring because I can fully understand the things I'm learning and can do well in exams. <br /><br />No participation mark so good for those who don't like answering questions during class lol.",

            "comment_content": "It covers the four basic financial statements in modern accounting—the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of stockholder's equity and the statement of cash flows.<br /><br />In terms of the difficulty of content, I wouldn't say the content, per se, is difficult. In fact, it's quite manageable for most. What's hard for most students is the tricky aspects when multiple new contents come together. However, following the course and doing all the work in a timely manner will get you there. (although bear in mind TANG Chao's finals are notoriously a killer... don't be fooled by the relatively easier midterms)<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this course is that it does not test your memorization skills. Whenever they tested theory (in midterms or finals), they would make the answer obvious, in the sense that you didn't need to memorize exact or word-for-word phrases in preparation. They focus more on testing your understanding of how accounting actually works.<br /><br />If you have DSE BAFS background, you definitely have a competitive edge, as I've seen my friends with no accounting background struggle a bit more with this course than those with some type of accounting background in high school.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor TANG, Chao was extremely nice and helpful throughout the course and was always willing to stay behind and answer your questions.<br /><br />He also conducts multiple surveys (I believe one was in the beginning, one in the middle and one at the end) to get a better sense of how his students are feeling about the content/ workload/ pace etc. I liked this about him, as it shows that he takes student feedback into consideration.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about this course is how he would make us do practice questions at the beginning of the lecture &quot;recapping&quot; things we learnt last class, as well as a few questions at the end of the lecture, helping us consolidate our understanding of what we learnt for that class.<br /><br />There's no prominent accent or anything, and his teaching is easy to follow.",

You don't need to get the questions correct, but just answer them all!<br /><br />For the homework, you have unlimited tries, so although some of them may be time-consuming I think it really consolidates your understanding and isn't all bad!",
            "comment_workload": "Out of all the aspects, the workload would have to be the biggest downside of this course as it is simply the truth that practice makes perfect! You could do the bare minimum, in which case you can't expect high grades.<br /><br />In my opinion, though, it's not a matter of this course but just accounting in general which requires much practice for you to be able to tackle different exam questions in a timed environment.<br /><br />It also depends on how self-motivated you are, as I know different students spend vastly different amounts of time preparing for this course (and usually that correlates with your final grade in this course as well...)",

The grade kinda reflected that hardwork pays off. So non-BAFS student dont give up!!!",

The second half is about long-term financing, including the issuance of bonds and stocks, which are not covered in DSE. However, some of these topics are covered in FINA1303 (so I highly recommend you to take FINA1303 at the same time).",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Chen adopted a blended-learning mode, where we watched the lecture videos filmed by herself before we attended classes and she would just do some review on the content during lessons. There would be a chapter quiz once a week/every 1.5 weeks, all of which were held in class. <br /><br />To me, Prof. Chen is just super nice and passionate. You can literally feel her passion in teaching when you watch her lecture videos, and that she was able to condense all the key concepts in her lecture videos in a clear and concise manner (it only took me around 15-20 mins to finish watching her lecture videos for every chapter). Whenever I encountered difficulty in completing the assignments, I would send an email to her and she would reply in a timely manner with detailed examples and explanations given (even during the weekend!), making sure that I didn't have any misconceptions.",
            "comment_grading": "There are a total of 11 chapters, with 8 chapter quizzes (4 questions each) where each of them constitutes 2% of your total grade and 2 comprehensive quizzes where each of them constitutes 7% of your total grade. The questions for the 2% quizzes are really basic (for students with an accounting background) while the 7% quizzes require more thinking and are pretty challenging.<br />There are 10 assignments that you have to complete individually, one per chapter and none for the last chapter. Each assignment constitutes 2% of your total grade and you get 2 attempts for each of them. Even though you screwed up in your first attempt, you do not have to worry as aforementioned, you may email her and she would teach you patiently. <br />There is also a group exercise for each chapter, where you have to read news articles and finish the questions assigned by Prof. Chen. Those questions are easy in general, some of them are thought-provoking though. The 10 group exercises constitute 22% of your total grade, and you would secure the score as long as you submit them on time.<br />Besides, there would be participation scores awarded which constitute 3% of your total grade. You can either raise questions on the discussion board in Canvas or answer her questions during lessons and take a selfie with her after the lesson ends to earn a participation mark. You only have to do these four times in order to be awarded full marks for participation.<br />Lastly, the final exam constitutes 25% of your total grade. There are 3 sections in the final exam paper, namely basic, intermediate and advanced levels. The full mark of the final exam was 148. While she said that the basic level questions were similar to that in those 2% quizzes, I felt like those so-called &quot;basic level questions&quot; were already more difficult than those in the 7% quizzes, and I am pretty sure you just can't imagine how hard the questions in the rest of the exam paper could be. What made me find the exam exceptionally difficult was that each question required extremely complicated calculations, yet no marks would be awarded if your final answer was wrong. <br />For your reference, I got full marks in all quizzes and assignments except for one 2% quiz. I also secured the 22% from group assignments as well as the 3% from participation. The score for the final exam was not released &quot;in order to avoid unnecessary panic&quot; as quoted from Prof. Chen. While I bet I did not score any higher than 30% in the final exam, I managed to get an A+ at last. Therefore, my suggestion would be to try your best to secure the 75% from quizzes, assignments, group exercises, as well as participation so that you can have some sort of &quot;safety net&quot;.",
            "comment_workload": "While the workload was relatively large compared with other professors/courses, I would say that it was manageable (may be biased because I learned accounting in high school and I took FINA1303 in the same semester so I didn't have to spend so much time understanding most of the concepts). Also, Prof. Chen's arrangement makes you do revision for the content of each chapter every week, and you would find that a lot of time could be saved when you study for the final exam. Moreover, it was the workload that allowed me to get a good grade. Therefore, I actually love the way Prof. Chen designed this course",

He likes to share some practical issues with us. For example, he always talks about franchise business which is unrelated to our syllabus. But this kind of knowledge is useful if you want to study deeply in accounting. <br /><br />You must attend his lecture to know what is going on. Because his ppt is too concise. You won't be able to know what does he means by just reading the ppt. During our lesson, Kelvin just shows a ppt slide and does a lot of explanations. We have to write down the main points! He speaks very fast and seldom repeats. You have to write very very very fast to catch up his speed. <br /><br />If you have no accounting background like me, it is very hard to understand what is going on. For example, in the first few lectures, Kelvin will assume we all know some accounting terms e.g. Credit and debit, fair value, historical cost, residuals. I don't know what is going on... He speaks very fast with lots of accounting terms. I can just stare at him. I want to cry when I was looking at those T accounts. However, if you pay enough effort, you can tackle it! I watch his lecture video many times and read the textbook. Actually, the textbook is better than the professor. I learn everything from the textbook before I attend the lecture. So I could catch up and understand the accounting issues. Therefore! Don't give up! <br /><br />Kelvin is a very nice and kind professor. He is very willing to answer your questions. Even some stupid questions e.g. What is net realizable value? He explained it very clearly. One time, he chatted with us and answered our questions until 8 p.m. So he is very responsible! The best handsome professor in UST! <br /><br />He always asks questions during the lessons. These are easy questions. You can just shout out the answers. if no one answers, Kelvin will answer them by himself but he is so poor! So remember to respond to his questions!",

Kelvin didn’t give us any extra practices and past-paper, he just uploaded some after chapter exercises on canvas. I didn’t do any of it because I think it is unnecessary.

So don't feel sad even if you're a non-accounting high school student!<br /><br />This course covers some basic concepts for accounting, such as four financial statements and components. I believe other people from the forum has already copy and pasted the info, so I won't do it here.",
            "comment_teaching": "Sorry for the upcoming rambling guys, I just want to tell you how awful he is!!!!!<br /><br />Dennis is not bad in teaching. He does teach us something, and his English is proficient compared to other prof. Rather, I often found Dennis being utterly rude, which really affected the learning atmosphere. Many people in this page praised Dennis for being a great teacher and you'll probably think I'm just a 打手 who got a bad grade (though merely an A-). So allow me to explain.<br /><br />Dennis Chan is an impatient, strict and stubborn man who gets all-defensive easily, which often put me and my classmates off. One time I asked about why my classwork was deducted by 30% in a neutral manner, &amp; he responded with a very long message condemning me about not reading the guidelines... To be frank, I did not intentionally put my full name in wrong order, and that you didn't write in the rules that the order is to be put right, but merely 'full name as stated in student ID card'. Both of us have the responsibility to fix the issue, and besides, it is my grading that is affected, but not yours. There is no reason for him to be so angry :)<br /><br />Second, he loses patience easily when you ask him more questions in depth, and it often feels like he is angry with students. After such undesirable experience with him, I just feel frightened whenever I ask him something via email. (Ironically, he only smiles and nods with know-it-all non-locals who interrupts in the middle of his sentence and raise questions.) I really wanted to learn more about the accounting mechanics, but unfortunately Dennis is not the prof that I should ask for.<br /><br />Third, he sometimes puts up classwork that are not even mentioned in class (he mentioned compensation expenses, but not the whole procedure). This is totally unfair to those who are willing to learn but don't have related knowledge, compared to those who had learnt such in high school ! By the way, his policy of having sudden quizzes at the end of some classes without prior notice makes me really nervous. But I guess it's just my problem lol<br /><br />Lastly, remember to preview the slides before lectures because he assumes us to already know something about the concepts and thus will not explain the basic ideas. For instance, he won't tell you what a 'write-off' is, and he just jumps right into the journal entry steps, assuming that you already know it. He only kept giving us trivia that are only useful when you get the gist of the content/ want to get into accounting major.",
            "comment_grading": "update: Eventually an A- for this course.<br /><br />We got 8 classwork,<br />3 homework assignments &amp;<br />a final assessment with 50 questions that are to be completed in 60 minutes.<br />The grading policy is super intransparent. He gives no details after the finals.<br /><br />By the way, don't, and NEVER, ask Dennis about grading policies (absolute/relative, request for paper-checking), whether via email or in person. Otherwise, be prepared to be scolded by him :)))",
            "comment_workload": "homework and classwork assignments are mostly done on MH connect, an online website that gives you access to our e-book (though most of us don't read it as it's lengthy) and online assignments.<br /><br />The workload is not that heavy -- no mandatory readings or questions, but only several open-book online assignments during class (meaning, you have to attend classes even there's no attendance) as well as homework. But these are okay as it also helps you consolidate concepts that you've learnt in class.<br /><br />Homework assignments are more time-consuming - it requires us to do a full accounting process. The third one regarding inventory systems was the hardest. I used like 3-4 hours cumulatively to complete it.",

The difficulty is totally different from the quiz and practice paper. You will need to spend a lot of time in studying the final (mean: 40 sth only) <br /><br />My Grade: B<br />I think is acceptable as I got and B but not really good.<br />All my quizzes are above mean or even median.

You get three tries in each assignment and it counts the last try as your final mark. For most of the assignments I finished in 1-2.5 hours, but sometimes it took me 3-4 hours depending on my level of understanding.<br /><br />The practice questions are useful in helping you understand concepts used in the homework as they are similar.

It is divided into two parts, part one on connect and part two on canvas. Part two is written and only examines the last few chapters. You are also allowed to bring in a cheat sheet. Pay attention for the long questions in the practice questions, it is likely that the final contains questions requiring you to answer in the same pattern.",

Not so recommended if you're new to accounting cuz it will be hard to catch up, but at the end of the day, you just need to put some more effort.

Instead of teaching the actually course content during the lecture, we are suppose to watch all the videos before class (in which I totally didn't do). Prof Chen will answer your questions and give you a brief summary about last week's stuff. If you ever have any questions, just ask her. She uses her email like Whatsapp.",

I think that if you DO NOT have any prior knowledge in accounting, DO NOT choose blended learning mode. Some of the videos are very simple and for a starter it is very harder to catch up. Just trust me, blended learning is not for you dear.<br /><br />The second thing is, my lecture (specifically L14) was full of WBB students. If you don't know what WBB is, just think of them as overpowered year 2 students from all across the globe. Not only are they elites, they also dominate all the quizzes and assignments. If you see a absurd amount of foreign students in your class then you know what to do, swap OUT of this lecture cuz its gonna be a blood bath.<br /><br />Tbh if you think you are a strong student you will find it an easy course with not much new to learn but literally everyone gets full marks in everything so you better watch out for the careless mistakes.<br /><br />Although I kinda caught up with everyone before finals and scored 0.33 sd above mean, I still got a C+ cuz my quizzes and assignments were miserable.",

To make matters worse, Prof Chen covers one chapter a week. Each chapter has an assignment, a quiz and a group discussion. The group discussion is fine. Just open your mouth and say something. It doesnt have to be value-adding. The quizzes are simple as they are mostly 3-5 MCQs, but for a dumbass like me i usually get 2 out of 3 while the entire class gets 3. The assignments are the worse, Especially for the first few assignments, they are long and hard (thats what she said) for a student with no accounting background like me. Prof Chen literally emailed me asking me why I opened my assignment for 54 hours. Well thats becuz its so hard I couldn't finish it in one day, so i left it open over night and continued the next morning. Remember the situation happens every week cuz 1 assignment 1 chapter.",

I will talk more about it in the 'teaching' part.

The examples in his notes is also not enough. By the way, we are required to remake the bonds examples using Excel in order to tackle the exam questions easily, it is though not bad, but time-consuming. Sometimes his slides are a little bit messy too.<br />Another point worth mentioning is that he will use some real-life companies such as Nike, McDonald's etc to explain some concepts.

I would say all of the content is useful. The content is generally easy to understand (except the Bonds part which took me two weeks to digest). Some people say that you'll have an advantage in this course if you have BAFS or high school accounting background, but I don't think it's that significant. I personally did DSE BAFS but with Sidd's teaching style and focus, many of the topics and concepts were new to me as well.",
            "comment_teaching": "Sidd is one of the best professors I've met at UST. He always prepares real-life examples to illustrate each of the concepts, which are easy to understand. In class, he often goes through financial statements of actual (big) US companies so you get a sense of the real world. He makes sure to explain concepts in the simplest way possible, which makes his lectures extra easy to understand. <br /><br />He is also very very nice and seems to have endless patience answering questions. He takes time answering even dumb questions and you can feel that he genuinely cares about his students.<br /><br />However, one small problem is that his notes are not the most structured. But it's not that major as I still have no problem understanding the content, I just need some time to organize it in my mind.",
            "comment_grading": "In terms of grading homework quizzes and exams, he is very lenient. If you look at his marking schemes, he gives partial marks even for answers that are almost completely wrong, as long as you have made some sort of attempt. It's not hard to get partial marks from him.<br /><br />That being said, almost everyone gets high scores for the homework quizzes and the midterm (most people got full marks for the midterm), so it almost fully depends on your final performance. Be mentally prepared that his final is significantly harder.<br /><br />Components:<br />15% Higher of HWQ1 or 2<br />15% HWQ3 <br />30% Midterm Exam (Median: 100, Mean: ~95)<br />40% Final Exam (Mean: 57.24, Max: 96)<br /><br />Overall I scored 96.4% which resulted in an A+<br />(Thank you so much Sidd for saving my cga)",
            "comment_workload": "Very very chill I love him so much.<br /><br />Firstly, he doesn't count attendance which is already a major bonus. Secondly, unlike other professors (who gives timed quizzes and homework regularly throughout the semester), we only had 3 homework quizzes and a midterm exam, all of which were take home (~30 hours to do something that can be done in 2 hours).<br /><br />The final is a bit painful though. The paper is very long but you only get 3 hours to do it. He explains that this is to prevent us from cheating, which I guess is a good idea since it makes the online exam fairer. The final exam is pretty much all the workload for the entire semester. <br /><br />A piece of personal advice: just make templates and excel sheets for everything in advance and that will save you a lot of time in his final.",

The Zoom polling results are also useful since I can view the percentage of classmates with my answer as well. However, only the most popular answer is highlighted in red instead of blue. Not only can I not see what I have answered, but also I cannot see the correct answer and needed to pay extra attention to the lecturer.

Here are some summary statistics of the grade. Average: 6.37 (85%); median: 6.7 (89%); Standard deviation: 1.02.<br />We figured out that Proctorio does not support the use of VPNs (see https://proctorio.com/support).

To help you better manage time, I put easier questions earlier and more difficult questions later. <br />2) It is advised that the camera should capture your hands and face during the exam. Since there is limited typing required to take the exam, the proctor may check with anyone who uses the keyboard a lot.<br />Best of luck and I wish you success in all your future endeavors.&quot;<br /><br />Participation marks are obtained by participating in each Zoom poll each lecture. Wrong answers do not affect marks in this section, but not answering will lose marks. If 16 out of 20 polls are participated in, 4 out of 5 participation marks are obtained.<br /><br />The homework consists of SmartBook assignments and Problem Sets. SmartBook assignments (0.5 points each) are for each chapter except 1, 5, and 13, where multiple-choice questions are answered repeatedly until 2 questions are answered correctly for each concept. The number of wrong answers does not affect the grade so this is where I can speedrun and find where I am not adequate quickly.<br /><br />Problem Sets (4 points each) consist of 5 individual assignments where a few long fill-in-the-blank questions are answered. Originally, only 2 attempts are allowed but after the first Problem Set, it was loosened to unlimited attempts. The resulting mark of each Problem Set is the highest mark of any attempt.<br /><br />I really like the quizzes where around 20 Multiple Choices are to be answered in 30 minutes with the Proctorio extension of Google Chrome to force a full screen and monitor the camera. Provided by the publisher, they allow for enough time to think about each question clearly and carefully, so I can score maximum marks each time. Moreover, he answers each question from students clearly and combined with logical slides, I am able to learn effectively. However, it messes with my dinner schedule on five Thursdays of these three months so I would like to see this changed.<br /><br />Final Grade: A+ Thank you Tang Chao!!!",

            "comment_teaching": "Gerry's teaching is ineffective in my opinion. He teaches from his own point of view instead of from students' or beginners'. He supposes us knowing everything, thus rarely do live demonstration on perplexing problems. What he does every lecture is just explaining concepts and definitions that are not very important and share his own experience. After that he directly asks students to do his assigned practices from textbook and starts reading out students' name one by one to take attendance. I have sit for Chen Szu Fan's lecture and I found her teaching is rather easier to follow for beginners. Gerry's unappealing lecture could be reflected by the attendance rate. I realised that after midterm, the attendance soon dropped to 60-70% though attendance is 10% of the course grade. Yet, the good thing is Gerry will provide full solution for his suggested practices of every chapter.

I am a Business minor student (from Science School) with no prior high school background. Some people said it is hard to survive Gerry's Accounting course if you only are a beginner (because of the terrible teaching), making it impossible to get a C grade or above. This is not the real case if you are hard working enough and using the right way for studying, understanding every concept thoroughly. That is why after my disastrous performance in Quiz 1, my results for other tests improved drastically. Unfortunately, I have no time for revision of the final exam (my Organic Chemistry exam was on the same morning!!!) -- I only studied for 4 hours right before the final exam!!! It is great that Gerry did not give me a C grade. If I were in Chen Szu Fan's class, I would probably end up a D grade!!!",
            "comment_workload": "If you are not aiming high and you already have some Accounting background, I would say the workload is low. Basically when grading the homework, the TA wouldn't care about the correctness of your answers and figures. As long as you finish all the assigned problems, the TA would give you full score. All the tests are not difficult as well when compared to other professors'. However, such easiness implies difficulty to achieve good grade. If you aim high, it is better to read through the textbook carefully and finish every single problem, which is rather time-consuming. Remember, practice makes perfect! <br /><br />There are several points that you need to pay attention with. For the two quizzes, rather than being application-oriented, Gerry also covers some subtle concepts from notes and textbooks that students normally skip. Only being able to do calculations is likely to cause you below mean (or at most slightly above mean). Don't think quizzes with MCQs only are that easy!<br /><br />For the midterm exam, as long as you can do all calculations without mistakes, you will be fine. For the final exam, although only the last five chapters are covered, please don't forget the fundamental concepts taught in the first half of the course. Don't be satisfied with the illusion that you are able to complete all the practice exercises on textbook. Otherwise you will cry in the final exam! Plus, unlike the midterm, there are several questions that require you to give definitions, provide examples, and do comparisons. I guess most students won't pay much attention to such details. I guess Gerry use these to differentiate between A+ and A grade students.",

Also, you should spend some time working those practice problems. (solutions provided)<br /><br />I don't really remember he had taken any attendance, but I suggest you go to his class. First, Something is missing in the lecture notes, you have to go to the class. Second, It might be difficult to comprehend the knowledge just by reading the notes, listening to his explanation is certainly a better choice.

One point to appreciate is that she will provide us with a collection of what questions we have to work on every week, instead of simply giving us the question numbers and asking us to find them ourselves in the textbook. More importantly, she will provide solutions to us together with the collection. Therefore, if you do not want to work on the solution ourselves, time can be saved to directly copy the solutions.",

However, he sometimes is not clear with his explanations and makes the content more confusing than it is. His classes were not very interesting, slides were similar to the textbook and are uploaded online, so overall you don't really need to go to class. However, he does give practice questions (you work on as a group in class and turn in before the end of class) during many classes which count towards your grade and help understand the material a lot more effectively than the lectures themselves. <br /><br />So, I enjoyed how his class was structured into lecture and practice questions since he was very helpful in explaining HOW to do questions and the midterm and final short answer questions were very similar to practice questions.<br /><br />If you are able to learn well on your own, then I would recommend Kelvin. If you need someone to explain concepts very clearly to you, I would not recommend his class.",

Participation (10%)<br /><br />For midterm and final, if you have a clear mind on all concepts and have gone through sufficient exercises, you would probably excel in those. The marks in midterm are quite close and the mean is around 56/70 for my class. I don't data on final so can't help that.<br /><br />For ethics case project, you are given sufficient time to do it. Don't rush and fully comprehend the requirements. Dr Mak would give sufficient guidings so it won't be too tough. Make sure you do enough researches. Again, no data on it.<br /><br />For participation, some would refer to the performance of your in-class practices, some would refer to your participation in answering the questions. For in-class practices, there would be a total of about 8-10 practices and he would only take the highest 4 for grading. The practices would be done in the group format. Find somebody who knows BAFS and there is nothing to worry. the mean of each practice is around 90% of the full mark. For real participation, although he stressed the importance of answering his questions to the final grading, I just ignore him and I still get A- in this course.",

Thus, if you excel in error correcting and above all, general journal, things would be easier. <br />Second, there aren't many new concepts. I can only recall the statement of cash flow, division of common stock and repurchase of common stock as new concepts. <br />Third, the answer is out there. Just don't make things complicated. This course resembles a simplified version of HKDSE, for example, when there is an estimation of allowance for doubtful debt, this course would ask you to Dr. bad debt Cr. allowance for doubtful debt. I have seen many classmates, including myself, of course, struggled to accept this fact. So my suggestion is--find the difference between this course and HKDSE and adapt to it. That's all.",
            "comment_teaching": "Do not be deceived by this grading. I ain't suggesting that Kelvin is a mediocre instructor, or professor, whatever you like, despite I had seen his title as professor in his office. <br />He's passionate in teaching. There are a few examples supporting this statement. <br />1. Janitor on LSK's accounting department has applauded Kelvin as &quot;an humble and amicable professor who is willing to answer anyone's question<br />2. I have witnessed him staying behind lectures and encompassed by a knot of students for at least an hour. <br />3. Well, this is on the record, which is he made extra classes on Saturday in LSK, despite the fact that I HAD NEVER attended any of those. Lel. <br />4. By the way, he focus on &quot;conceptual understanding&quot;, which I don't give a **** coz here's the case: if you have studied BAFS, there isn't a need for you to understand A=S+L while if you haven't studied BAFS, may god bless you. <br />Lamentably, several examples disapproved the above statement. <br />1. His tone resembles your most boring teacher in secondary or primary school. <br />2. I have attended all his lectures and I have slept in quite a lot of them. <br />Here are some tips from me:<br />1. First, Kelvin speaks English fluently, in my opinion. But, according to my observation, he loves to say &quot;in other words&quot;. So, if you find him not saying this, this maybe an impostor. Lel. <br />2. Second, Kelvin asked us to &quot;pick up the convention&quot; in doing general journals. In other words, follow his order and pick up the convention by writing narratives. <br />3. Third, there are in-class activities. Those exercises are EXTREMELY simple if you, again, do well in HKDSE's BAFS. So, here's the tip, if you have never got your ass on BAFS, it's my advice to find partners who have BAFS background. But, according to my experience, if you find this difficult, it's either your problem or doomsday of HKUST SBM. <br />4. Last but not least, well, I am more than certain that I didn't abuse the phrase &quot;last but not least&quot; cause I believe this is really the most crucial. FIND A COMPANY WHO IS HUMOROUS!!! This is really crucial because attending his lectures, given that you excel in secondary's BAFS, would bring you endless sleeps. You need a humorous, or pretty, either of them or both, classmate to keep you awake. <br />That's all for his teaching part.",

Again, those in-class exercises are nothing except jokes. <br />They are extremely easy, implying that you limit of score should ALWAYS be tending to 10, which is the maximum score. <br />2. Again, the mid-term inherited the simplicity. <br />I would say the SD is rather small, 10 out of 70. IDK<br />Kelvin loves to assess his students by MC <br />So, be careful <br />Long questions aren't the main character <br />Thus, focus on conceptual understanding. <br />3. Case study is an abomination. <br />First, the grades aren't disclosed. <br />Second, it's difficult <br />therefore, no tips at all <br />4. Again, the final is about simplicity again <br />It resembles part A of HKDSE's BAFS. <br />That's all <br />I scored A- <br />A bit sad, tho",

For students who haven't done accounting in the past, i strongly recommend you not to hesitate and ask Prof. Mak any questions you have in class or after class, as i've been doing so a few times and it really helped me strengthen my concepts and knowledge.

As expected, I started off the course panicking, uncertain of what's to come. But the materials were way to understand and guides you to LITERALLY, learn the principles of accounting. To me, that's awesome. The only downside to the materials is our professor requires us to finish 12 chapters for the final exam, while other professors only need their students to go through 3-4 chapters for the exam. Believe me, that kinda sucks. But overall, I'd say I actually learnt something.",
            "comment_teaching": "Same with the title: meh. I mean, I'd say this course is a total disaster based on the extra chapters we need to study, but after attending all the lectures, I could still vaguely understand what she's talking about, even though getting good grades is another completely different matter. Her classes aren't that funny and energetic, but also wasn't too boring or dull. So I'd say her teaching was so so. See what I did there? :)",
            "comment_grading": "Not sure if I've been through hell in other courses or what, I actually think The grades in this course is amazing. I've seen other comments complaining about the harsh grading of this professor, and at first I had the same thought. My midterms were getting worst, and I only studied for three days for the final exam. Seemed like a B or B- to me. Shockingly, it's a B+. Yeah o know, it's not worth bragging, but still, that's awesome to me. Bad thing is till this day I still have no idea of the grade I got in the exam.",
            "comment_workload": "There's a shit ton of workload in this course, so get ready for some ass-whipping. Three quizzes(identical to midterms), one project and one exam. Sounds pretty normal, but it's complete shit compared to other professors. Started the project two days before it was handed in, had two free-rider groupmates, and I'm glad I grabbed it in on time.

Be prepared to pay effort to catch up. You have to learn 2-year stuff within 3 months. <br /><br />But anyway I do not recommend anyone to give up from studying this course: It is very important that you need to know how to read financial statements&nbsp;&nbsp;and pay attention to some ratios in preparing business case analyses (Case Competition, LABU stuff) or let say, ACCT2200 you will study in second year in HKUST.<br /><br />Your hard work may not give you A in this course but the effort you pay can be turned into real outcomes in no longer future.",

It is very hard for students with no accounting background to catch-up<br /><br />The conclusion is: She hopes to develop concepts for students with no accounting background but in reality she kind of fails to do so. If you are students with BAFS experience, skip her class. If you are students without accounting background, attend her class, work harder, and you will be surviving then.",

Not too difficult if you have listened to him or have a look at the notes. I would rather spend 10min to revise before each quizzes than doing assignments or presentations.",

Proof-reading is essential for her LOL.<br />However, she uses examples not stated in the lecture notes to illustrate the concepts very often. That's fine for me as a previous BAFS student in high school, but certainly not okay for my peers without accounting background. <br />Nevertheless, I must say Prof Chen is a nice professor. She is always patient to answer the questions raised by my peers with a smile. She also treats every single word she says seriously. One day she shared a piece of information about the characteristics of the accounting frauds. On the next day I saw her announcement on Canvas, asking us not to use race and gender to judge others (Although I think no one treat her words seriously...).

No difficulties In understanding his words.

It is very important to fully understand all concepts and use them wisely.<br />The highest score in the final is 83.5/100.<br />As i get 83.5 in the final, I finally get an A+.<br />Therefore, I would say it is not a difiicult course if you pay effort in it.",

It is literally a test of mental handicap, your dying grandma would have scored 90. The final exam though is quite challenging, I still vividly remember how frustrating people were when they were leaving the exam venue. I already have a strong accounting background and I still found it challenging, at least, compared with the previous two TSA level mid-terms. Some basically left several pages blank. I would say it is too harsh for those who didn't have the training in past paper or DSE exam.<br /> <br />I got 97% in the final exam, forgot my score in homework and mid-term. 97-98% overall and nailed my A+. The A+ cutoff was around 95-96%",

Why HKDSE Economics student need to study econ2113, but HKDSE BAFS student dont need to study a more advanced ACCT course? This makes me very frustrated and are OPed by most BAFS students, which leads to a poor comment after all.<br /><br />However, the course design is excellent, at least not boring compared to other subject. Becuz there are a lot of content that will raise your interest in not just the ACCT field, but also some contents related to Finance, which is useful, from my point of view. <br /><br />Btw, Cash flow statement is the most challenging topic afterall, and will determine whether u get B+ or an A-range",
            "comment_teaching": "Excellent teaching, with a little bit Hong Kong accent, but at least better than a lot of professors. Although sometimes he claims that he worked in an Ibank to do M&amp;A before, he seldom talked what he do, which will be an interesting thing to raise student's attention in lectures. He goes through lecture contents in a moderate and acceptable speed, sometimes explaining tricky concepts very in detail, which is good for non-BAFS student like me. Patrick&nbsp;&nbsp;is definitely an excellent and warm-hearted professor that is willing to answer questions and teach students after lessons (not just ran away immediately), but the final exam paper could be more difficult after all.",

Four financial statements, journal entry, bad debt, bond, etc. The content is not so hard TBH, but if you want to understand it thoroughly and do well in exams, make sure you SPEND SOME TIME. Accounting needs practice or you may feel you know everything in class, but end up finding you know nothing in exams.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor TANG make points quite clear. Concentrating and following him in class can help you a lot. He also puts some extra practice on canvas to help you learn better( which myself find quite helpful). He is also very patient and ready to help, so if you meet with any trouble on accounting or didn't do well in exams, you can always appoint with him and talk about your problems.",
            "comment_grading": "Fair grading. <br />6%attendance<br />14%homework<br />30% for 2 midterms <br />50% for final.<br />Just submit your homework before ddl and basically I think everyone will get full mark in hw.<br />Sometimes prof will take a pop quiz or ask you to hand in a pop exercise in class , which will not be graded but will be regarded as attendance.<br />2 midterms are quite easy.<br />Midterm 1 Mean 83 SD 14<br />Midterm 2 Mean 76 SD 19<br />Final is harder,Mean 62 SD 20.<br />Good luck !",
            "comment_workload": "Workload actually differs from individuals. For me, it's pretty hard. As a student who hasn't studied accounting before, I just find 30-40% of my study time is on accounting. I go through every materials in hand( notes, practice, hw, textbook etc) and pay 100% attention in class. Of course efforts will pay off. My performance in exams is quite satisfactory.<br />There're 8 assignments after class. Usually you have 1 week left to finish it. Each assignment will include 3-4 questions and I think it's okay. Besides, 2 midterms, 1 final, and some extra practice( which is not compulsory). Again, you can fool around with these assignments and quizzes, but if you aim high, you should devote your time to this course. I have to say this is my favourite course during this sem cause I find out I really learnt something useful and interesting in class, and this is what matters most.",

If you have taken BAFS (accounting module) in DSE, you will have a great advantage since many of the topics are introduced in the DSE such as bad debts, prepayments and accruals. Of course the accounting treatments are slightly different but if you have a solid foundation then it is absolutely easy to understand. New topics can also be expected such as the treatments of bonds and cash flows statements. If you have not taken any accounting courses before, it is better for you to read through the textbook to understand more.",
            "comment_teaching": "I registered this lecture only because this session had the shortest waiting list but professor TANG Chao is unexpectedly good. Although it seems that he is not a local professor nor a native English speaker, his English accent is clear and easy to understand. His teaching pace is simply easy to catch up with and he provides examples as well. He explains clearly and will remind you of the main points and common mistakes made by students so as long as you pay attention in class, you will be fine. He will explain again if he thinks a number of students do not understand. Also, he is willing to answer students' questions. In fact, quite many students ask questions in class and he explains one by one patiently. Good choice if you are considering which session to register.",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is just as usual. If you pay effort and show you understand the topics well, you will do well. You can refer to the mean and median in other comments. You may notice that the mean of final is particularly low (around 62 if I remember correctly) but I think it applies to all sessions. I heard that final exams of other professors were also much more difficult than their midterms so it is fair.",
            "comment_workload": "Around one assignment each week or every two weeks. Each assignment consists of 3 to 4 questions. As long as you submit, you will get the mark. Accuracy seems not the point. But practice is needed for accounting so doing assignments is just for your good. 5 attendance taken throughout the semester.",

            "comment_content": "I. Course Description<br />Accounting is the language of business. In this course you will learn how to &quot;speak&quot; and &quot;read&quot;<br />this new language. The course is designed to provide an overview of the financial accounting<br />frameworks and processes leading to the preparation of financial statements, and develop your<br />relevant skills to read, interpret and analyze corporate financial reports from various dynamic<br />business perspectives.<br />II. Course Objectives<br />Upon the completion of this course, you should be able to:<br />1. Develop a comprehensive understanding and well-founded knowledge of financial<br />accounting, covering:<br />a. the accounting categories: assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses;<br />b. the ways an accounting system keeps track of data and information;<br />c. how generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) influence what is recorded<br />in the books of an entity;<br />d. the preparation of a balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement;<br />e. the reading, interpretation and analysis of a set of financial statements.<br />2. Understand the role of financial accounting in the decision-making process of business<br />organizations, and apply financial accounting frameworks to business situations.<br />3. Form critical judgment covering an ability to identify and define accounting and business<br />problems, apply analytical and quantitative techniques, and to make and justify decisions;<br />Page 2 of 5<br />4. Communicate effectively through collection, analysis and organization of information and<br />ideas and their clear transmission;<br />5. Demonstrate teamwork, independence and creativity including working, learning and<br />problem solving as a team and independently; and<br />6. Develop ethical and social understanding including a knowledge and respect of ethics and<br />ethical standards in accounting and an understanding of social and civic responsibility.<br />III. Required Textbook<br />Libby, Libby, and Hodge. Financial Accounting, 9<br />th Edition (International Student Edition),<br />McGraw-Hill, 2017.<br />Note: You are required to purchase/get a copy of the textbook for your reading and practice of<br />the exercises/problems. Previous experience indicated that students who followed the reading<br />and practice in the teaching schedule were more likely to achieve a higher final grade.<br />IV. Course Assessment<br />Class Participation 10%<br />Quiz 1 10% (Sep 25 in class)<br />Mid-term Examination 25% (Oct 26 at 7:15-9:15pm, venue: TBA)<br />Quiz 2 15% (Nov 13 in class)<br />Final Examination 40%<br />Total: 100%<br />V. Course Policies<br />1. ACCT 2010 will have two class sessions per week that will each blend lecture, tutorial,<br />problem solving, and discussion together. Each topic will start with a lecture followed by a<br />discussion of some selected exercises/problems in class to improve your understanding of<br />and familiarity with the topic lectured, subject to availability of class time. I expect that you<br />will come to each class adequately prepared by a brief and first-time reading of the<br />appropriate chapter of the text. This allows you to pay more attention during a lecture to<br />issues that you have had difficulties in understanding the concepts and theories on your own.<br />The course is practical in nature and case-oriented requiring a problem-solving approach in<br />your learning and you are strongly encouraged to participate in doing the assigned<br />exercises/problems both inside and outside the class, though they are not collected and<br />graded. The solutions to all practice exercises/problems at the end of each chapter will be<br />posted on the course website after the chapter is done.<br />2. Class Participation. You are expected to attend all class regularly and on time, having<br />prepared beforehand all readings. I also expect you to be actively involved in all class<br />discussions, including asking questions, sharing your knowledge and experiences during<br />the class. All of us, your fellow students and me, will be benefited from insightful comments<br />and thought-provoking questions. On the contrary, those who chat in class are doing a<br />disservice to everyone present.<br />Page 3 of 5<br />3. Quizzes, Mid-term and Final Examinations. All quizzes/exams are closed book, closed<br />notes unless otherwise announced. The scope of the quizzes/exams will be announced<br />during class. Two quizzes held in class are scheduled on Mondays, September 25 and<br />November 13. An evening mid-term examination is scheduled on Wednesday, October<br />25, 2017 (7-9pm). The final examination is cumulative which may include topics under<br />the scope of the mid-term examination and quizzes. Programmable calculators are not<br />permitted.<br />It is expected that all students will take the quizzes and examinations at the scheduled time.<br />There will be NO make-up examination for the quizzes and mid-term. If absence from the<br />examination is due to unexpected medical emergency, the marks earned from the final<br />examination may be adjusted to substitute for the missing quizzes/mid-term grade. A<br />student foreseeing unavoidable absence due to a strong justification may seek approval from<br />the instructor for similar arrangement. Any other absent students will get zero marks for the<br />quizzes and mid-term exam.<br />4. Academic Honesty. It is important that students follow university regulations on academic<br />integrity and honesty. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and will be dealt with in<br />accordance with university rules, which can be accessed at the university website:<br />http://www.ust.hk/vpaao/integrity.<br />VI. Getting Help and Staying in Touch<br />I will post course-related information at the course web site on CANVAS. There are prescheduled<br />office consultation hours for the course. I suggest that you either visit during these<br />office consultation hours or make an appointment by sending an email to me. You can ask<br />substantive (as opposed to procedural) questions by e-mail — but please keep in mind that the<br />questions pertaining to the course material should be preferably asked in class.<br />Apart from asking questions in class, you can also use the discussion board on CANVAS to<br />raise smart questions for the benefit of everyone – the questioner, the instructor and other<br />students. I will check the discussion board and post replies regularly. You are encouraged to<br />reply to other students’ questions on CANVAS as part of a supportive learning environment.<br />I strongly encourage you to raise your questions either in class or on the discussion board as<br />soon as your problems arise. Do not allow your puzzles or confusions to accumulate because it<br />will be more difficult to solve them at a later stage.",
