We could talk about the prevalence of the SNPs in a population, the conservation of the SNPs in other species, experimental models and the disruption of functions of a protein implicated in the disease.<br /><br />BTW don't get confused. &quot;Data mining&quot; here is about the use of tools like Variation Viewer and other public databases. It has nothing to do with computer science or coding.<br /><br />We also needed to conduct a group project on one of the case studies. We received 1 or 2 pages of information, usually including a pedigree, traits and other characteristics of a rare genetic disease in advance. Based on the information we needed to correctly identify the disease and the gene associated, review publicly available databases and primary literature, explore variants and relate the gene function to the disease.<br /><br />The group project summary was basically a recap of what was mentioned in the group project.",

            "comment_workload": "Have to admit it is not an easy course. But if you know what to study it's not difficult at all. The first impression of the whole class is like the elite kids who are already so engaged with their own experiments and projects take this course. I had no experience with lab or anything and was first time using genome browser, clinvar, uniprot, etc. But because professors explain things very clearly, as long as you focus during the class, you will be able to score well.<br /><br />Group project: your topic is given a week before your presentation date. You will be given with a genetic disease so you will have to talk about how such mutations (variants) lead to different phenotypes (pathogenic). Groups of 3.<br /><br />Group project written report: Write script for each slide. Even if that is not your part, you make your own script and submit the presentation with the script in the notes.<br /><br />Data mining assignment: 4 genetic diseases is provided to the whole class. Choose one disease and find out 5 SNPs that can be used to diagnose if the patient is having the disease. No longer than 4 pages<br /><br />Please don't get intimidated by what I have written here. I also had no idea what to do and did not understand what they want me to do. But professors will help you out and you will get things done without yourself realizing it. <br /><br />Good luck!",
