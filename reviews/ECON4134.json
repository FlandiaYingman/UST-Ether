        "description": "All human endeavors are constrained by limited knowledge about the laws of nature, external events in the past, present and future, how other people (including ourselves) are going to behave, etc. Life is filled with decision problems without perfect information of their consequences. In view of these, research on the decision making and strategic interaction under risk and uncertainty have been extremely active for the past few decades. This course aims to provide an introduction to this exciting field of research and suggestions for further exploration. The first part of the course is devoted to the economics of uncertainty and covers topics including the expected-utility model, market allocation of risks and asset pricing. The second part of the course is devoted to the economics of information and covers topics including moral hazard, bargaining, auction theory, mechanism design, and information aggregation in the market.",

It is quite interesting and fruitful for students to study in this field as the course clearly established a picture to go depth in microeconomics. Instead of solely theories, you are able to apply those concepts in real-life applications after learning. I believe it is a good course in terms of fundamental knowledge in analytical research in economics. Well-designed lecture overall.",
            "comment_teaching": "Pak Hung again is one of the best professors in ECON courses for explaining theories and math. Though the concepts are pretty abstract and hard to understand, he always provides a detailed explanation and examples to back up and is also willing to solve students' problems.<br />So I will say it is worth taking this course under his teaching if you are interested in ECON theories and would like to challenge yourself with some math skills. Overall I did not get good grades (for sure lol), but I would say the learning and the knowledge I experienced were wonderful hahaha.<br />Besides, the teaching assistant is passionate about solving your problem, he is skilled enough to give you advice and suggestions. Overall, this course on teaching is for sure excellent!!!<br /><br />(updated)<br />Professor is absolutely generously giving good grades... can't be better anymore...",

            "comment_content": "The content is similar to previous offerings except the notion of General Equilibrium is introduced before Arrow-Debreu Equilibrium.<br /><br />The first part of this course is about uncertainty. Studying how to make investment decision under uncertainty. Will dive deeper compared to Econ 3113 and Econ 3143 (Intertemporal Consumption).<br /><br />The second part is about information. How private information in a game affect the equilibrium result and how to mitigate that. You will study something interesting like: Can we trust collective wisdom? The Herding Effect; Auction; Mechanism design...<br /><br />I think the mechanism design part is the most inspiring part. If you study Economics to make the world a better place, you will be interested in this topic.<br /><br />Quite mathematical demanding but very interesting. Just like the previous reviews, this course is example based so some example may require specific mathematical knowledge to understand. In general, you have to be comfortable with probabilities. But I think Pak Hung teach quite well in explaining the math part so I still recommend taking this course.<br /><br />You can also fulfill Econ4670 by this course. However, since there is no paper requirement in this course, you have to do extra work. Considering the complexity of this course, I suggest using other course for Econ4670 if possible. But Pak Hung also gives very good instruction and timely response in writing the paper.",
            "comment_teaching": "Again, Pak Hung is very good at explaining theory and math. The content of this course is quite difficult so quite a number of students asking questions after the class. But he will answer the questions patiently even after teaching 3 hours.<br /><br />Tutorial sections will focus on solution of problem sets. One tutorial is used to teach lecture material because the progress laid back.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading Scheme:<br />Participation 3% (just show basic etiquette in class, no attendance needed)<br />Problem set 15% (best n-1, graded by effort)<br />Midterm 26%<br />Final 56%<br /><br />Participation + Problem set: everyone should get full marks.<br /><br />Midterm:<br />Mean: 61.93<br />Median: 65\tHigh: 80<br />Upper Quartile: 73.75\tLow: 31<br />Lower Quartile: 53.25\t<br />Me: 80/80<br /><br />Final: Not released<br />My Grade: A+<br /><br />Cannot determine the grade distribution in my case.",
            "comment_workload": "No compulsory attendance but professor will only release lecture recording by demand (e.g. you're sick). I think attending lecture is a most because it is very difficult to study the slides alone. Videos during add-drop period/some challenging topics will be provided as well.<br /><br />The main workload in on the exams. Personally I think Pak Hung has lowered the difficulty of the exams because too many students find this course too difficult. You are allowed to open everything except internet during the exams, and questions are quite similar to the problem sets (or even more easy in my point of view). You can see the median of midterm exam is quite high.<br /><br />Also, the numerical answers are usually in simple form (usually no decimal points), so it is easier to do checking unlike Industrial Organization.",
