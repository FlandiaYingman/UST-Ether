            "comment_content": "There is no attendance requirement for this course. The exam syllabus is the same as last semesters. Check out other reviews for that. The following are the new concepts this course teaches:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Chemical Foundations<br /><br />Laws – law of definite proportion, law of multiple proportions<br />Older atomic models – billiard ball model, plum-pudding model, Rutherford model, bohr’s model<br />Experiments – cathode ray tube experiment, millikan oil droplet experiment<br /><br />Chapter 2: Atomic Structures and Periodicity<br /><br />The first part consists of chapters 1 and 2 of DSE E2 physics.<br /><br />Second part is about quantum atomic model:<br /><br />Schrodinger’s equation, wave function, atomic orbital, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, quantum numbers, Aufbau principle<br /><br />The chapter also teaches how to use QM model to account for trends in the periodic table, for instance, why electronegativity is highest at the top right, why atomic size is the largest at the bottom left etc.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Bonding: General Concepts<br /><br />Bond length, definitions of non-polar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and ionic bonds, lattice energy, bond energy, lewis structure, resonance structures, formal charge, naming of compounds<br /><br />Chapter 4: Molecular Structure and Orbitals<br /><br />VSEPR model, hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonding and pi bonding, molecular orbital model, bond order, paramagnetism<br /><br />Chapter 5: stoichiometry<br />(Nothing new here)<br /><br />Chapter 6: Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br /><br />Hydration of ions, strong, weak, non electrolytes, Molarity vs Molality, complete ionic equation, net ionic equation, Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, non-whole number oxidation numbers, electron donors and acceptors in redox reactions<br /><br />Chapter 7: Chemical Energy<br /><br />Heat, work, state function, extensive property, first law of thermodynamics, definition of internal energy, definition of enthalpy, constant-volume calorimetry<br /><br />Chapter 8: Gases<br /><br />Pressure, barometer, manometer, Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Avogadro’s law, ideal gas law, standard temperature and pressure (STP), Dalton’s law of partial pressures, kinetic molecular theory, effusion and diffusion, real gases behavior, van der Waal’s equation, compressibility<br /><br />Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids<br /><br />London dispersion forces, polarizability, capillary action, cohesive and adhesive forces, crystalline solids, amorphous solids, unit cell, x-ray diffraction analysis of solids, Bragg equation, atomic solids, metallic solids, network solids, Group 8A solids, molecular solids, ionic solids, hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure, cubic closest packed (ccp) structure, simple cubic unit cell, body-centered unit cell, face-centered unit cell, net spheres, band model, substitutional alloy, interstitial alloy, doping, p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductor, p-n junction, holes(semiconductor), octahedral and tetrahedral holes, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of fusion, definitions of melting and boiling, normal melting and boiling points, supercooling and superheating, phase diagram<br /><br />----------<br /><br />The above are primarily from the textbook, Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach, 2nd ed. which the course uses.<br /><br />And I probably haven't included things from the lecture notes, Professor Li's lecture notes are so full of content, which deterred me from reading them.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />As you can see there is a lot to learn in this course, some of the concepts are not discussed too in depth. For example, I still have no idea how orbitals actually hybridize. Nonetheless, this serves as a decent introductory course.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />There is a post on the University of Houston subreddit where you can find the download link of the textbook in the comments. Just search 'An atoms first approach 2nd edition' there.",
            "comment_teaching": "I only attended three lectures. I never asked the TA any questions. So I apologize for not being able to give a grade that reflects accurately the teaching quality.<br /><br />What I remember is that Professor Li had a very heavy accent.<br /><br />And they also recommend doing some pre-study before attending the lectures, which I think is not humanly possible because there is too much to digest. Just learn at your own pace. <br /><br />In case you need them, recordings of lectures are uploaded after a few days to possibly a week. Lecture notes are uploaded only after the professor has finished teaching the chapter.<br /><br />You can find the lecture notes, answer keys to textbook questions and some past papers here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QoAhy0lvGzuIj1waii6w3XCyfiIsj6Nc?usp=sharing<br /><br />Although you need not attend/ watch the lecture videos, I do recommend attending/ watching the tutorial sessions held before each of the exam. The questions demonstrated are similar to those in the exams.",

What's even better is that the answers to those questions are exactly the same in the exams as well, they don't change the numerical values even if it's a calculation problem.<br /><br />Revise the notes only if you have time and want to get a really good grade, the exams are based on the content of textbook. (I didn't do that except for the first chapter, still enough for an A+)<br /><br />And if, for some reason, you still have time left. I suggest reviewing subtle concepts that you don't normally think will be asked, e.g. formal charge(in the ppt they said it's optional to learn), the definition of atomic mass unit, formula mass and molar mass, definition of acids and bases, determination of direction of work done from a chemical equation, factors affecting vapor pressure (the textbook does not mention what factors won't affect it). To my surprise, the concepts I listed above were asked in mid-term and final.<br /><br />If you can't follow the professors' teachings, don't even bother attending/ watching the lectures. But attending/ watching tutorial sessions held before each of the exam is highly recommended, because the questions they teach there are similar to those in the exams.",

But his ppt covered the details you need.<br />Prof Huang's teaching is more interesting in comparison (maybe this is also because the content she covered was more concrete). Her lectures often start with a small experiment demonstration as an inspiration to let us think about why what we saw in the experiment happened. The content of that lecture will regard the experiment and she will conclude what we learn in that lecture by explaining the experiment result. This kind of teaching mode makes the course a little more interesting.<br /><br />Btw I think the textbook isn't really necessary to buy. If you just want to pass the course and do well on the exams, just go borrow the book from the library or find one on a bookshelf in hall and do the exercises. Attending the lectures or watching the video and then review the ppt is enough for this course. I bought the textbook but I seldom use it so I kind of found that it's wasting money to buy it...",

Both professors are willing to answer students' questions, you can raise your question at the end of lecture.

I skipped some lectures (coz I am lazy) and started revising the textbook several days before exams. Still, I managed to obtain a satisfactory grade. Also, it is not a must to purchase the latest version of textbook (3rd edition) as you can find a majority of homework questions appearing in the older version (2nd edition).

            "comment_teaching": "I am so sure that you will be amused by Xiaoyuan teaching. He is the Chair Professor of the Chemistry Department and he has a long teaching experience.<br /><br />He prepares well for all lectures and able to deliver the key concepts of each chapter with in-depth explanation and the use of graphics and animations. The lecture PPTs include the details of each chapter and give supplement to the content which are not mentioned in the textbook. The lecture PPTs are designed with proper and rational logic, which are easy to follow and understand. The lecture PPTs assist the Professor to point out the fundamental concepts of each session of every single chapter. <br /><br />The presentation skills of Xiaoyuan, I would say it's funny and causes lots of laughter. He has a special voice and speaks loud during lectures. He behaves like a proactive child and presents the content with fluctuations and intonations. As a Mainland Professor, his English is much better than those local professors and easy to understand. Sometimes he makes good use of his voice to grab students' attention. <br /><br />Some of his pronunciation are quite funny indeed :) Enjoy lectures and you definitely get lots of rewards. Feel free to raise questions through email or just face-to-face. <br /><br />Xiaoyuan also prepares review and tutorial sessions before exams, showing that he is helpful and responsible. <br /><br />By the way, Xiaoyuan is energetic:) Really a good professor and teacher in my first semester study in the University.<br /><br />For TA Elaine, she particularly worked on the tutorial session before exams, working on examples of exam-oriented questions. Better not to miss her tutorials.",

But if you score high in mid-term(which is much more difficult than final) and get a reasonable score in final, A range should not be a problem.<br /><br />Grade: B+ (I did slightly above mean in midterm but over 1 SD in final, so it's standard curve-shape grading, you know the grading for most Year 1 Courses are very strict compared to those major courses)",
            "comment_workload": "Actually the workload is reasonable. <br /><br />Just read and understand the details of the lecture slides and the textbook examples. Try to apply the concepts learnt by doing the self-practice provided in the textbook and read the sample answers to grab the required concepts. Please do the self-practice provided during the tutorial sessions since some of the questions are similar to those appear in the examinations. <br /><br />However, to secure your grade, hardwork is still need. Students experience difficulties when they studied the first few chapters of the course. Try to understand and memorize the concepts and logic, make some key notes and work on the exercises for further consolidation.",

Also, there were only 13 students enrolled so the lecturers welcome students to ask questions and have some interaction. This course started the first lesson in july, so there may not have enough time to teach to the all the topic, thus the content is much fewer. Among these chapters, Chapter Review are the basic common sense about math and science taught in junior secondary school. Chapter 1 are some history of Atomic model which was learned in compulsory part of dse physics. Chapter 2 introduced the atom (wave particles duality, Atomic orbitals, electron spin etc.) which partly learned in elective part of dse physics. Chapter 3 and 4 are new things about bonding ( VSEPR, Lewis structure, hybridization and molecular orbitals). Overall, these topics are mainly related to high school physics but not chemistry ( but it is still a chemistry course without any Chemical equation)",

She prepared a detailed ppt with highlighted important points so it was very easy to revise.<br /><br />Jason<br />Jason was responsible for teaching ch3 and 4. His teaching style was compatible to private tutorial school teacher. He printed some self made colored lecture notes for us and then wrote some notes on it. We then copied the notes, but the annotated notes usually release on canvas after a few days. He will bring some apparatus to the classroom and do experiment, although only for once throughout the whole. Also he was nice to ask questions.",

Therefore, it could really help if you can get a high mark in midterm.<br /><br />Also, it is reminded that tutorial class can ONLY help you get a satisfactory score. Reviewing all lecture slides is a must for those aiming A. Details of complex formulae excluded from the tutorial slides can be ignored, but their variables and the uncertainty inequality should be recited as it was tested. <br /><br />One hint for the midterm exam is that always think more and deeper using the basic theory. Examples used in class to illustrate the theory are chosen to be simple, but questions are usually one level higher in difficulty.",

In his lecture ppt, there are a lot of extra things that are not required in the exam. Therefore, it would be difficult to learn from his ppt. He used a green laser pointer to point at the ppt. Sometimes the pointer is too bright and the reflection of it from the ppt nearly made me blind. The ppt would be uploaded after his lectures. btw in every lecture the first thing you would hear from him is &quot;In last lecture, ...&quot;<br /><br />Professor Huang is a good teacher who teaches chapter 5-9. Her tone is also loud and lively but the pitch is too high. At the beginning of every lesson, she may invite 2 students to perform simple experiments.

The idea of quantum mechanics as a perspective on the Periodic Table of Elements.<br /><br />Ch. 3-4 focus on bondings, namely, the ionic and covalent bondings. These bondings will be viewed and discussed from the atomic orbital perspective. <br /><br />Ch. 5-7 focus on chemical reactions. Students will &quot;learn&quot; about chemical reactions from the perspectives of energy, mass, and type. (&quot;learn&quot; cus you've learned them in HKDSE NSS Chemistry)<br /><br />Ch. 8-9 focus on the state of matter. Students will study molecules and atoms in gas, liquid and solid phases. Part of HKDSE NSS Physics content will be covered, namely the part related to ideal gas.<br /><br />Most of the students will find the first 4 chapters difficult.

All of us have no idea of whether to jot notes or wait for PPT, so I chose to wait for video recording so that I can refer to PPT and try to follow him. His PPT matches all the bad examples of presentation slides, e.g., using crazy colors and backgrounds, 30 words for one point, etc. He just read aloud words by words and does not explain the proper nouns at all. I have no DSE Physics background and easily get lost during lectures. There are ZERO interactions between students and himself so everyone in the lecture theatre is just doing their own stuffs, no experiments, no in-class polls, etc. What's even worse is he only focus on those complicated content out of textbooks, with no practice questions in-class and assume we all understand the basics stuff including those Physics. Also, his English accent is terrible, but you can still bearly get what he means.<br /><br />Prof Huang prepares a series of funny experiments during lectures and many in-class poll to let us know we understand the content or not. She explains very clearly if we are in trouble, also welcome us to ask her questions after class, not just ask us to contact the TA. Her English accent and tone is very clear and cute. What's even surprised me is that she knows Cantonese! She is passionate on interacting with students and used a lot of daily life examples and experiments, even hand-make some models to illustrate some complicated concepts!

The concepts are not difficult, but indeed large in quantity, so it may be a good choice to take notes for every concept.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never attended class after the first two, but I think it's enough to get a good grade get the homework done and view every ppt carefully.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most difficult part for me would be the Atomic Structure models as I haven't learned structural chemistry before, so I have to read the book thoroughly myself. But the book was easy to understand with a clear structure, so although it indeed takes a period of time, I think it's worth doing so.",

Since the midterm and final include different parts, it's totally OK for me to forget all the instant after the exam: )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the exam are multiple choice questions, and it's highly recommended to visit past-paper and listen to the tutorial for each exam. Some high difficulty questions are similar.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grades:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midterm 57/60, with mean 39.9.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final 47/50, with mean 33.6.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got an A+ in the end.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a satisfying grade as I only take it as a CCC.",

He requires us to FINISH ALL THE QUESTIONS ON THE BOOK and 20% of them will be in the exam. That's a mountain load, dude...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Prof Huang has selected some exercises as homework. That's really considerate and easy to done.",

Do be prepared to self-study a bit more for Jia's part though.<br /><br />Prof. Jinqing's accent was relatively more clear, and her explanations are clear as well. She does small experiments throughout the semester, which makes the otherwise monotonous lecturing more bearable.<br /><br />Both profs provide polling questions to clear often confusing concepts, which is a definite plus. The questions can also be used to revise for the exams.",

However, his lectures were a bit boring and I skipped quite a lot of his lectures. <br /><br />For Li, his English is slightly better, but still quite bad.

I think reading the notes are kind of unnecessary if you have studied DSE Chem already. Just do the questions.

They would also stay to answer questions from Zoom chatroom after class.<br />The TA was really good. She replied to emails very efficiently. She held optional but helpful tutorials before mid-term and final exams.<br />The assessment was very transparent. They published statistics, like mean and S.D., and set up paper checking sessions. We could know where we got wrong and what the correct answers are. This helped us learn better by reviewing and allowed discussion after exams. (Some classmates argued about two questions. The professor accepted their reasons and gave them marks.) Plus, they worked efficiently. It was my last final exam but the first one to finish paper checking and release the grade.<br /><br />It is just that you may feel a little frustrated if you expect very good pronunciation in lectures.",

Professor HALPERT covers the chapter 1 to 4 and those are tested in midterm, and professor LI covers the chapter 5 to 9 and those are tested in final. According to my opinion, I like the way Professor HALPERT teaches as he keeps students to involve in the lecture by asking some questions during the lecture. Meanwhile, professor LI does not involve students during lecture and moreover, his speaking style is quite hard to comprehend.",

It really helps to fill in the atomic orbital theory, a very important part of chemistry that is completely cut from the HKDSE syllabus. <br />The professor highly recommends the book &quot;Chemistry: An Atom's First Approach, 2e&quot;.<br /><br />Below is the list of chapters: <br />1. Chemical Foundations<br />2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity<br />3. Bonding - General Concepts<br />4. Molecular Structures and Orbitals<br />5. Stoichiometry<br />6. Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br />7. Chemical Energy<br />8. Gases<br />9. Liquids and Solids<br /><br />Some might describe this course as more similar to a quantum physics course.<br /><br />It is highly recommended that Chapter 8 Gases is studied in conjunction with thermodynamics in PHYS1112, since studying them together can help reinforce the understanding of the concepts in the chapter.",

I think it will be even better if you read through and understand the lectures first before the tutorials since you can ask about contents you dont understand and the IA is actually explaining it better and she will tell you it is not tested in the test or exam if the content you asked is not related. And i would highly recommend to attend the tutorials a few times especially if you are not familiar with the things taught.

Although professor talked in a lively way, but most of his words were just from the power point (and as the time for the class commence is 10:30 a.m., many students including me fell asleep), and before mid-term and final exams, he may or may not finish teaching the content covered in the exams. But if he cannot finish the things covered in the exams , he would still test you about the things he didn't talk about, just because &quot;They're included in the reading assignments! Lectures are conducted to help you understand the things in the book.&quot; So please be careful.",

The chapter about gases is more like DSE Physics. The chapter about solids and liquids are in-depth version of DSE Chem where calculations are involved in microscopic view.",

Li has a better accent than Jia but Li barely asks questions to students, while Jia always do polling questions. I would say buying the Textbook is a must. The textbook explains the concept clearly and it is easy to read. Just study textbook and powerpoints. DO Remember to attend Elaine's review session before the exam. The information she gave is important, and I discovered that they also include some sample questions in the final exam. <br /><br />Highly recommend to buy textbook.

His lecture slides have highlighted many key points, and also included some extra information. The professor was very passionate and knowledgeable. However, I did not attend much of his lectures as the content is pretty easy.<br /><br />The teaching assistant hosted two tutorials, one before each exam. She would briefly summarise the content covered in the exams and offer some sample questions as exercise. Even though the number of questions is quite little, they are still helpful for you to test your understanding and to familiarize with the exam format.",

The main content is about the quantum mechanical model of atom which is quite different from what I have learnt in high school. The professor kept strengthening the importance of atomic orbital and clarifying the most confusing part. After the midterm we were taught about Molecular orbital which is similar to atomic orbital. However, if you didn't learn the AO part well you are gonna suffer from MO and keep snowballing, so please revise and learn AO thoroughly.",

Or else except you're very clever or hard-working, you'll fk it up very hard.<br />I actually think that there should also be an honour course for chemistry, cuz one semester for all these contents for a normal local student is really too much.<br /><br />Course content (copied from other reviews)<br />Chapter 1: Chemical Foundations<br /><br />Laws – law of definite proportion, the law of multiple proportions<br />Older atomic models – billiard ball model, plum-pudding model, Rutherford model, Bohr's model<br />Experiments – cathode ray tube experiment, Millikan oil droplet experiment<br /><br />Chapter 2: Atomic Structures and Periodicity<br /><br />The first part consists of chapters 1 and 2 of DSE E2 physics.<br /><br />Second part is about quantum atomic model:<br /><br />Schrodinger’s equation, wave function, atomic orbital, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, quantum numbers, Aufbau principle<br /><br />The chapter also teaches how to use QM model to account for trends in the periodic table, for instance, why electronegativity is highest at the top right, why atomic size is the largest at the bottom left etc.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Bonding: General Concepts<br /><br />Bond length, definitions of non-polar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and ionic bonds, lattice energy, bond energy, lewis structure, resonance structures, formal charge, naming of compounds<br /><br />Chapter 4: Molecular Structure and Orbitals<br /><br />VSEPR model, hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonding and pi bonding, molecular orbital model, bond order, paramagnetism<br /><br />Chapter 5: stoichiometry<br />(Nothing new here)<br /><br />Chapter 6: Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br /><br />Hydration of ions, strong, weak, non-electrolytes, Molarity vs Molality, complete ionic equation, net ionic equation, Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, non-whole number oxidation numbers, electron donors and acceptors in redox reactions<br /><br />Chapter 7: Chemical Energy<br /><br />Heat, work, state function, extensive property, the first law of thermodynamics, the definition of internal energy, the definition of enthalpy, constant-volume calorimetry<br /><br />Chapter 8: Gases<br /><br />Pressure, barometer, manometer, Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Avogadro’s law, ideal gas law, standard temperature and pressure (STP), Dalton’s law of partial pressures, kinetic molecular theory, effusion and diffusion, real gases behaviour, van der Waal’s equation, compressibility<br /><br />Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids<br /><br />London dispersion forces, polarizability, capillary action, cohesive and adhesive forces, crystalline solids, amorphous solids, unit cell, x-ray diffraction analysis of solids, Bragg equation, atomic solids, metallic solids, network solids, Group 8A solids, molecular solids, ionic solids, hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure, cubic closest packed (ccp) structure, simple cubic unit cell, body-centred unit cell, face-centred unit cell, net spheres, band model, substitutional alloy, interstitial alloy, doping, p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductor, p-n junction, holes(semiconductor), octahedral and tetrahedral holes, vapour pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of fusion, definitions of melting and boiling, normal melting and boiling points, supercooling and superheating, phase diagram",
            "comment_teaching": "The English of Prof Jia is hell, it's more like Thai rather than English. Prof Li is better in pronunciation, which makes the lectures a little bit attractive. However, both of them just read the ppt out so not attending lectures and read the ppt by yourself has no big difference.<br />TA Elaine is angle btw.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is fair, A range is very big I heard ppl getting A for an overall 80%. Cannot find the distribution graph but I remember that the score is quite normally distributed.<br />For the final grade, it counts 50% mt and final, mt asks ch1-4, and 5-9 is for final. <br />Score:<br />MT:<br />Mean: 66.35/ 100<br />SD: 14.68<br />Median: 66/ 100<br /><br />Final:<br />Mean: 63.06/ 100<br />SD: 14.06<br />Median: 62/ 100<br /><br />My score: 94（+1.9sd） for mt and 88(+1.6sd) for final, overall 91/100, got an A+. The cut off for A+ is probably 90.<br />I got 5** in physics(E2E3) and 5* in chemistry so the grade is fair for me. <br />Reach out for help from dailos in wtapp group, they're more than willing to answer your questions.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is zero for me as I have learnt all the content before. However, base on my observations and the frequency of others asking questions, it's probably quite chur for normal ppl. Read the lecture notes and slowly digest the context. Don't be hesitate to ask questions cuz if you didn't do physics in high school, the concepts will be very abstract for you.",
