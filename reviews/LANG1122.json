        "description": "This course builds on the groundwork laid in LANG 1120 and LANG 1121, and takes students to a higher level of understanding of spoken Chinese and a stronger communicative competence in using Chinese in daily, social and professional situations. The course is restricted to students with non-Chinese language backgrounds. Instructors’ approval is required for students with Chinese backgrounds who are from international schools of Hong Kong, China Mainland and other Asian countries, also for overseas students with either Mandarin or Cantonese language backgrounds. For students without prerequisite but with prior Chinese learning experience of approximately 100 hours may seek instructors’ approval to enroll in the course.",
