        "description": "The course introduces the basics of cell biology, molecular biology techniques, and discusses the principles of macromolecular interactions in those contexts. We will also discuss various applications of these techniques and how combined with engineering concepts, they have contributed to innovations and breakthrough tools in the world of basic research and medicine. Topics to cover include: overview of basic molecular biology and macromolecular interactions; basic biophysical structures, imaging and characterization techniques; molecular engineering; biodevices; and genomics. Active student discussion is required and students will also do a final project team presentation on a current bioengineering topic.",
