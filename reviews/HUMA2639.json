        "description": "This course introduces students to topics on death and dead bodies from an anthropological perspective. We discuss specific ethnographic cases from all over the world with a concentration on the East Asian region. The course covers key anthropological concepts such as taboo, pollution, liminality, and dead body politics through both classic and contemporary ethnography. The three fundamental questions we ask throughout this course are: What happens when we die? What impacts does death have on social life? How can we better understand the politics and economy of death? Each question provides key elements of an understanding of the cultures of death and dead bodies. The course therefore aims to teach students to see the politics and economy of death and dead bodies as integral to the variety of cultures of death. It emphasizes an exploration of the power of the state and of capitalism, social relationships, and modern institutions as well as their impact on managing corpses, performing rituals, and regulating grief and mourning in the modern era.",
