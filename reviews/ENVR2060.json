My score is around sixth or seventh but only B range WLTF...<br /><br />Same as above, I have argued and discussed with him for the whole morning and sadly nothing can be changed. Really sorry for Benjamin becoz I think the pressure from ENVR is quite heavy<br /><br />The most scary is that student who get 80 in overall has the same grade as student who get 60 in overall. (they both have C) ( •̥́ ˍ •̀ )<br /><br />Good news for students who doesnt want to revise but if you are strong enough you will feel upset in this course.",
