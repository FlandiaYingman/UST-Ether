            "comment_content": "This course gives a concise introduction to the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is a numerical method developed for solving structural mechanics problems originally. This is later developed for solving practical problems in other fields like electromagnetism and heat transfer, and eventually used as a method for solving boundary value problems from partial differential equations. The course content is listed below. <br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. Review of basic numerical methods<br />3. Finite element analysis of 1-D problems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. axially loaded bar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. heat conduction<br />4. Finite element analysis of truss structure<br />5. Finite element analysis of bending beam<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Shape functions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Element equation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Solution procedure and methods<br />6. Finite element analysis of 2-D problems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Formulation of 2-D heat conduction<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Interpolation function and 2-D elements<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Assembly of stiffness matrix<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Solution of 2-D heat conduction problems<br />7. Finite element analysis of 2-D problems â€“ applications in plane stress/plane strain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Review of linear elasticity theory<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Finite element model of plane stress/plane strain<br />8. Advanced topics (may or may not cover, depend on course progress): (for my year: nonlinear problems, error and convergence, eigenvalue problems, time-dependent problems)<br /><br />This course has a postgraduate counterpart, with more detailed content covered, but both of them have skipped the mathematical analysis behind FEM as this is rather involved and requires pretty high mathematical maturity.<br /><br />I strongly recommend MAE students to study this course because after you have a taste on FEM, you will see the power of it and you will know how real life problems can be solved by using numerical software. Although the course content is elementary in the field of FEM, it may be a bit challenging to some students as this method requires quite complex matrix computation. If you are afraid of this, you can still sit in the class and get the essence of FEM.<br /><br />It is also important to know how FEM is different from other methods to know what kinds of numerical schemes one should adopt to solve a particular type of problem.<br /><br />[Edit] Some of the lectures will be used to hold lab sessions, where TA teaches how to use the software such as MATLAB and ANSYS. It is not compulsory to attend because you can just follow the lab notes yourself to do the tasks, but TA is nice, so you can ask him questions if you are stuck. There is also one additional lab session for discussing the final project.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is an expert in FEM, so she is knowledgeable on this subject. She speaks with fluent English, but a bit monotone. But this does not affect the teaching quality. Sometimes she may ask people to do some in-class activities, e.g. ask people to draw something on the whiteboard, due to the small class size (~20).<br /><br />The TA is quite good. He answers questions swiftly and with patience. He also gives comments on what I have done wrongly in my homework to let me know why I have points deducted.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading: <br />6 Homeworks&nbsp;&nbsp;20%<br />Mid-term Exam 40%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Term Project&nbsp;&nbsp;40%<br /><br />The mean grade of this course should be around A- as the class size is small, so the grade distribution set by the school may not apply. As long as you perform okay in mid-term, you will not have any problem.<br /><br />For the midterm, the questions are similar to the homework. There is one bonus question at the end for the year I take, but no one get a very good mark on that question. I just get zero out of that.<br /><br />My situation:<br />HWs: overall should be at mean score<br />Mid-term: 100/100 (mean: ~84)<br />Project: 89/100 (mean: ~78)<br />Grade; A+<br /><br />Conclusion: Doing well in midterm helps a lot XD<br /><br />P.S. People taking this course are usually pretty strong or strong exchange students. We also have one MATH major joining us. I don't know what will be the situation after I post this review, as this course is only listed in material option.<br /><br />[Edit on 13/11/2020] The course is also listed in Design Option. This may attract more (strong?) people to enroll.",
            "comment_workload": "IMO, pretty high workload in the beginning as there are a lot of matrices, so I need some time to digest and adapt to this. The project should be okay as long as you have a good teammate (but not for me).<br /><br />The first HW is on MATLAB, HWs 2-4 are on hand calculation, and HWs 5-6 are on using mechanical APDL (ANSYS) for solving problems by FEM. The hand calculations have a lot of steps and you need some time to finish that. Just prepare more time on this.<br /><br />For the mid-term exam, make sure you go to lectures and jot some notes as it may cover something said in lectures but not included on the lecture notes. For the lectures after the midterm, you can just go into selective listening mode.<br /><br />For the project, it's a 2-people group project. You need to use numerical software (whatever software you like, as long as it uses FEM) to build a bridge or design a fin structure for heat dissipation from a computer chip. Make sure you get a friend to study this course with you to avoid freeriders. For my situation, as the total number of people enrolled is 21, there is a 3-ppl group (my group), and there is a freerider there. My other groupmate and I had a hard time for that and we submit the project report late. But at the end, it is treated fairly and the freerider gets a discount on his score. So enroll this course with your friend.",
