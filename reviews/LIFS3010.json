Sometimes, there was too much information on one slide. The midterm covers only his part and it was quite difficult to be honest. It had true or false, fill in the blanks, a few short answers and multiple choices. The questions, especially the fill in the blanks, can be quite ambiguous so perhaps that's why the midterm felt difficult. <br /><br />Professor Wu is a great professor. He really knows the material very well. However, he isn't the best explainer. Sometimes when he explains a concept, he may go off topic or over-explain to a point where you might be more confused then you originally were. That's why you really should watch the lecture video in-depth and religiously if you want to do well.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have questions as he is giving the lecture, I would recommend you to wait until the lecture is over and ask him personally. He explains much better there.",
