        "description": "The course introduces modern advances in behavioral economics and bounded rationality to try to answer why individuals' behaviors deviate from the standard economic theory systematically, why individuals are \" biased\", and tend to find the link of some aspects of psychological regularities. Topics include inconsistent preferences and self-control, judgment under risk and show the economic implications of those psychologically richer models.",
