        "description": "The course gives an introduction to the analysis and design of sensing, estimation and control systems in a networked setting. It consists of three parts: the first part introduces necessary background knowledge in communication networks, sensor networks, linear state estimation, MAP and ML estimators, Kalman filtering, and modern control theory; the second part focuses on analysis of network effect to remote state estimation and control; the third part presents some advanced topics including distributed state estimation and resource allocation through scheduling.",
