        "description": "This introductory course on urban studies showcases how urban scholars analyze and interpret the changing of global city and regions. Instead of simply describing the various functions of the city-regions, we will take a more critical perspective in analyzing the major problems in city-regions. After taking this course, students should be able to re-discover the hidden and marginalized voices in our fast- growing city-regions today. Specific attention will be given to the city-regions in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.",
