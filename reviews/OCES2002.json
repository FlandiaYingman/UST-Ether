        "description": "This course is an introduction to chemical oceanography. It describes the chemistry of the ocean based on distribution and dynamics of elements, isotopes, atoms and molecules. This ranges from fundamental physical, thermodynamic and kinetic chemistry to two-way interactions of ocean chemistry with biological, geological and physical processes. It encompasses both inorganic and organic chemistry, and includes studies of ocean-atmosphere dynamics and marine sediments. Non-OST students may enroll in the course upon instructor’s approval only.",

            "comment_teaching": "The first half of the lectures are taught by Prof Wyatt while the second half by Prof Li. As you can see, the syllabus is quite large, and some chemistry calculations are needed in the contents taught by Prof Li. Prof Wyatt is nice and his ppt are quite detailed, Prof Li is new and is also nice and lenient, but her ppt are very simple. If you are good at chemistry you can do great in this course, if you're bad at chemistry, then much effort may be needed.",

The final exam is take-home and open book exam, the questions are also similar to the homework. I feel like the final is much easier than the midterm, which is closed book.<br /><br />Not sure what score I got for attendance and final as they are not released, but I guess I did fine. <br />Midterm I scored 10 marks below mean but luckily it only counted 15% of the grade.<br />I got full marks in all homework.<br />Final grade A",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is quit large as there's a lot of content to study, and there's 5 long questions homework which are also somewhat challenging. However, even if you got the wrong answer and the direction is correct, you can still get full score. You may need to take some time to do those homework. The final is not as hard as the midterm as there's plenty of time to do it and it's open book. Just make sure you are familiar with the topics.",
