            "comment_content": "Although it is named Animal Physiology, where you would expect memorising a huge list of muscles, bones and organs, this course actually focuses A LOT of molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways, so be prepared! Also, be prepared to remember very specific details (e.g. terms, numbers, organs). Overall the content is super heavy and require large amounts of revision and memorization of the lecture powerpoints and lecture videos (don't use any textbook they waste your time) <br /><br />The course is split into two halves (it actually feels like two very different courses) based on the professor teaching: <br /><br />Miller (focus on muscles and movement):<br />1. Muscle&nbsp;&nbsp;(5 ppts) <br />2. The Heart and circulatory system (3 ppts) <br />[Mid term exams] <br /><br />Pingbo (focus on body communication and regulation):<br />3. Endocrine System (4 ppts) <br />4. Digestive System (3 ppts) <br />5. Nervous System (2 ppts) <br /><br />My personal difficulty rating of each topic (1 being easy, 10 being hardest):<br />1. Muscles - 7.5/10, content was very new, mechanism was quite straightforward, a lot of diagrams and numbers to remember specifically.<br />2. Heart - 2/10, content was almost fully covered from highschool (e.g. IB) and 1902, some parts from muscles will be repeated here again. <br />3. Endocrine system - 9/10, like the regulation pathways were insane, and you need to know at least 20 hormones, and their negative feedback loop control and all. <br />4. Digestive system - 7/10, a lot of the content came from 1902, but there are extra parts like in-depth study of parietal cells and pancreatic cells which are extremely complex. <br />5. Nervous System - 4/10, he sorta rushed through it; he said he would remove parts about the auditory system from exams but it ended up being in the exam. The exam questions for this topic was very mathematical, focus a lot of the equations for this topic. <br /><br />Exams:<br />Miller's exam was very straightforward - 20 MCQs (20 points), and 135 points from fill in the blanks. The fill in the blanks is quite creative, sometimes it is labelling a diagram, sometimes you put in a number, or sentence (worth 2-3 points) or it can be in list form. All is direct recall from his ppt - so study that in detail! <br /><br />Pingbo's exam was slightly more difficult - 40 MCQs, not more than 15 fill in the blanks and some complex math questions on the nervous system (Nernest Equation, they were worth a lot of marks) - I personally found the math questions easy but most of the class skipped them. Issue with his exam was that his MCQ was confusing, like even though I know the content, there are always 2 choices which can be technically correct (a lot of questions and answers were super vague).",
            "comment_teaching": "Miller (A+ teaching):<br />- Everyone loves Miller! he gives off this cute grandpa aura and makes all these jokes that make everyone go awwww...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- He repeats the important points MANY times, so you know what is important; he technically answers all the exam questions indirectly. <br />- He explains his part very clearly, it all makes sense! <br />- After finishing one topic (e.g. muscle), he will give a non-graded class quiz of fill in the blanks; which is very close to the exam style. <br />- He discusses some of his tricky exam questions in class already. <br />- All his ppts are like 120-150 slides long, don't panic! - a lot of it are fun cartoons or fun stuff, a lot are repeated slides for the sake of what he is going to say, he likes to convey the same message/diagram as shown from various textbooks, and each slide contains small amounts of condensed important info. <br />- You would have to study over 1000 slides for the mid-term, but the way he made his slides really made it stick to your mind really well. <br /><br />Pingbo (A teaching):<br />- A bit more serious compared to Miller, still easy to follow. He tends to not repeat any content so its hard to tell which parts are important - basically his part goes on like a story plot. <br />- He has relates a lot of his info to diseases, medication and society, and he also make a lot of connections between different topics and sub-topics. <br /> - He includes A LOT of practice MCQ and study questions within his ppt, he usually does iPRS system in class (non-graded), however those questions are easier than his exam questions. <br />- He has around 60 slides per ppt, but very detailed. <br /><br /><br />Overall both professors taught well. Focus only on their ppts, don't use any textbook; this course is lecture recorded, I do recommend watching lecture videos - Miller actually discusses tricky questions in class, while Pingbo drops very subtle hints of certain exam questions that you can only possibly answer by what he said.",
            "comment_grading": "Very straightforward: <br />Mid term - 50% (Mean around 75%) <br />Finals 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mean is 62.6 / 110) <br /><br />My scores:<br />Mid-term - 93.4% <br />Finals - 92% <br />Eventually my score was around 92.8% ish, and overall 2nd in the class, got an A+. <br /><br />Mid term exams was a lot more competitive because the content was easier and clear and the exams were direct recall. The class didn't do too well for the finals, questions were far more tricky. <br /><br />From friends, I have also found out that an A grade requires around 86% overall, A- is around 80-81%. But may vary on your class performance ...",
            "comment_workload": "Its only prep for exam, but content was like huge - kinda heavy workload, but still manageable. <br /><br />What I did personally to get an A+: <br /><br />Mid term:<br />I went to all classes, after class I watched lecture videos, a lot of the details already stuck in my mind so exam prep was easy (he teaches very well) <br /><br />Finals:<br />I attended none of his classes (was busy with projects, woops), and that lead to a lot of procrastination ... I only started to learn the content a week prior to exams - basically I watched all lec vids and took notes, and 2-3 days fully memorizing the pathways; and it did end up going well.",

            "comment_content": "The course is quite funny and useful. More like an indepth version of LIFS 1902. Yet, it omits some of the tedious part e.g. kidney, which is good. Although the official syllabus seems to be really board and cover a lot of topics, as Prof. Miller taught relatively slowly, He can never cover the whole scope so he will just examine the topics covered. Usually, the last one or two topics of his part will not show up in the mid-term exam. (Prof. Miller teaches before mid-term and Pingbo after mid-term) The final exam is not accumulative.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Miller is a funny guy, so much better than Pingbo who is quite boring. Miller likes to repeats the same concept for several times from various approaches so if you do pay attention to class, you can definitely grasp all the concepts easily. And he is a really nice guy, wiling to take&nbsp;&nbsp;questions and conduct the lesson in a relaxing and interactive atmosphere. While Huang speaks in a boring tone although the content is alright but he can easily hypnotizes me. He does not simply read through lecture notes which is good but also give extra ideas related. And he made a lot of practice questions which are similar to the exam questions.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is not that good. The A-range is quite narrow in whcih you needs to get ~90% to fit in the A range otherwise you will immediate drop to an B+ or wtever. The exam questions are quite easy, MC and fill-in-the-blanks. Miller's paper are quite straight forward so the competition is keen. A lot of students score above 90%. While Pingbo's part is slightly more complicated that requires a indepth understanding of the course content and a good logical thinking in order to get the answer right.",

Actually, I have already fulfilled elective requirements but I still take this course as extra just because I heard that Miller is going to retire this summer. This means this year is the last year that can enjoy Miller's teaching, very sad&nbsp;&nbsp;:'(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to cry. This is definitely a loss to Lifs students. <br /><br />In this course, Miller continues his topics after what have taught in 1902. It is a detailed version of 1902 you can say. Miller's teaching never disappoints you. And the powerpoints are clean enough that you can easily study though there are many schematics. I didn't skip any lectures from Miller. As I said, I take this course just because of Miller XD.<br /><br />Pingbo I do have not many comments on him because his tone really makes you feel sleepy in most of the time so I basically skip all of the lectures except the last lecture of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to know more about Pingbo's teaching you can refer to other posts.",

The blanks are sometimes &quot;too blank&quot; that you have no idea what to fill in: Some blanks are long, expecting filling sentences I think. But they are just &quot;too blank&quot; that I dunno what I should fill in.<br /><br />Pingbo's final is all MCs with 80 questions. It is just tooooo EASYYYYY that I only spent 15 mins to finish it. The remaining time is to pretend to check my paper until half an hour is gone because the rule of final exam not allowing you to leave in the first half hour. TOO ＥＡＳＹ。。。Remember to study the MCs in PIngbo's ppts. Some are the same or similar.<br /><br />My score:<br /><br />Midterm: 86.8%&nbsp;&nbsp;(rank 5th of the class, total 164 students)<br />Final: unknown<br />Grade: A+&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Though I got A+, a large proportion can contribute to luck as this course is quite competitive. And I actually didn't have enough time to study final. I start to study for the final exam only the day before the final. I spent about 10 hours cramming up the stuff on Pingbo's part. Luckily the final exam is easy or otherwise, I would suck and fuck up.",

He will not provide video recordings of his lectures unlike MIller so you will have to join his lecture in person if you wish to.

However, as Miller will get retired in June this year, the exam format of midterm for this course may be subject to change in the coming year.<br /><br />As for Pingbo's part, the same exam format as in the pandemic times, 80 MCQs in total and they were quite straightforward with a handful requiring in-depth thinking.(e.g. High blood triglyceride level or insulin will stimulate secretion of growth hormones? )&nbsp;&nbsp;Do pay attention to which scientist discovered the proton pump as well as invented in virto fertilization.
