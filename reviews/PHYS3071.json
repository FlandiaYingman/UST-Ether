            "comment_content": "How can we model a star qualitatively<br />(or be more precise, main sequence stars)<br />How star forms, how star evolutes, and how star dies.<br />(basically you can fully understand those documentaries about stars after this course)<br /><br />If you have interest in astronomy and generally don't aim very high grade, this course is good for you.",
            "comment_teaching": "Good teaching due to small class<br />(this year only 16 students took this course)<br />Prof. can explain complicated ideas in a relatively easier way for us to understand. He can respond to our question effectively, (and he sometimes make jokes)<br />Mark release of courseworks on canvas are quite efficient.<br />(in a very short period after completion of the respective coursework)<br /><br />(much better than my major's prof. in general, which is mech)",
            "comment_grading": "Fair. Not bad, only slightly good grade.<br />Got 8x/100 (rank 2 out of 16)<br />And got an A in final grade.<br />No A+ this year, probably because my marks is nearly the same with the highest mark in this class(differ by only 0.03)<br />The grade curve just followed the university standard(slightly better in B range sub grades)",
            "comment_workload": "5 quizzes<br />Midterm<br />Classwork at the other half of every class(not difficult, and deadline is actually the next day)<br />A report on astronomy topic you are interested and a gp presentation on that report.<br /><br />The workload is quite high especially before quizzes and midterm, and I really need to have both good understanding and good memorization to get a good quiz/midterm result.",
