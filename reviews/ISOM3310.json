            "comment_content": "Content is very useful. It gives us many insights regarding e-business and start-ups, such as various types of business models, high-velocity decision making, long tail theory, community-based Internet marketing, etc. Some of the business models are really interesting and may sometimes be counterintuitive. For instance, there is a venture capital based in Europe which encourages copy-cat business models and emulating competitors, and as it turns out it's become very successful. Another notable example is the striking contrast of the fundamental strategies between two e-commerce giants, eBay (a largely unregulated bazaar) and Amazon (more regulated to ensure quality), and the reasons of why the two seemingly different strategies made both companies successful. It also digs into a more technical aspect of e-commerce, including the use of cookies, web bugs, e-currency, cryptology, etc. during the second half of the course. BTW the cryptology part looks pretty hard for me...<br /><br />It looked like to me a hybrid of marketing and IS courses. I took MARK2120 the same semester and I found the marketing knowledge helpful in this course. If you like start-ups and business models, there you go. Otherwise, this course may merely be a piece of memorization-based bullsh!t. Of course you can easily manage to get a decent grade with rote, mechanical recital, but if you really wanna learn something from this course you'd better understand the rationale behind each company's strategies and business models.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to E-business and Business Models<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Introduction to E-business<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ E-commerce Business Models<br />2Ô∏è‚É£ E-marketing and E-advertising Management<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Internet Marketing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Web Advertising<br />3Ô∏è‚É£ Google and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Case of Google<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Search Engine Optimization<br />4Ô∏è‚É£ Web Statistics &amp; Web Analytics<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Long Tail<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Internet Information Gathering Tools<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Personalization<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Web Analytics<br />5Ô∏è‚É£ E-commerce Applications - Retailing &amp; Auction<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Case of Amazon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Case of Blue Nile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Auction<br />6Ô∏è‚É£ E-commerce Applications - Uber &amp; Airbnb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Platform Business Model<br />7Ô∏è‚É£ Electronic Payment System &amp; Security Control<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Payment<br />8Ô∏è‚É£ Encryption &amp; Cloud Computing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ E-security<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Encryption",
            "comment_teaching": "Everything aside from the professor's accent is fine. At least he's really kind to us. Sometimes it's quite difficult to understand what he's conveying in the lectures, but after lectures we can always ask him questions to make out what's going on.<br /><br />One thing that could have made the course better is that there should have been IMO a separate tutorial teaching us how to make the website and conduct the web analytics in the project, cuz most of us in the class had a hard time figuring out what to do. Most of the groups even forgot to collect the data for web analytics using the StatCounter website and this caused quite a lot of troubles.",

Quite a few questions in the exams will not be mentioned in the study guideline he gives to us, so if you wanna achieve A-range, you should go over all the extra stuff out of what the guideline has mentioned. Get yourself particularly familiar with the reading materials and all the business-model thingy cuz they're the most likely to appear in the long questions in the exams. Memorize what kinds of tactics the companies mentioned in the articles use and you'll be fine in the exams.<br /><br />And make sure you don't miss any deadline - in this course, every % of your total score counts! Missing any assignment (3%) will significantly suppress your grade.",

His style is a lot more relaxed so he does not cold-call or force students to turn on their cameras.<br /><br />His course is more like a business strategy / digital marketing course than an IS course; you will be able to tell the difference in teaching style and methods for this course in a positive way. It could be a little boring, but the content is useful.<br /><br />He responds to emails very quickly and always gives a clear response if you have doubts. <br /><br />Having connections in the industry, he invites guests to share industry trends and views, which adds a lot of value in the learning process.<br /><br />While most IS professors will tell you how amazing IS is and give you the crappiest learning experience and grade, Professor Lee offers major good vibes; you can tell he genuinely wants good things to happen to his students, preparing us with more up-to-date industry knowledge and setting us up for success in many ways.",

He provides some extra examples to illustrate the idea occasionally. Many videos are played during the lecture and some of them are quite long, so it gets bored (sometimes the professor still keeps on talking even when it's time to end the class). <br />He sometimes left out some blanks in the slides so you have to fill the words back (just a few throughout the entire semester).

You should launch an SEO campaign for an NGO, so make sure you applied the concepts and techniques covered in Search Engine Marketing part. Just remember to include key concepts and specific terms in presentation.<br /> <br />Assignments (15%): 2 assignments in total. <br />(Assignment 1: 10%, Assignment 2: 5%) Just remember to complete them on time and you will get full marks. Not very complicated. <br /><br />Class participation (10%): He said in the beginning of semester that he will give out extra credits for those asking thoughtful questions or answering questions in class.... But obviously he did not have enough time for that... So you can probably ignore this part lol I didn't participate in class but still got a good grade.

Good if you can memorize things well.<br /><br />Project: Make sure you give yourself enough time to draft the campaign before launch. My group was the first batch for the project and literally got 4 DAYS to discuss everything. A very rush schedule so better if you can get yourself a later timeslot. (Our group didn't manage to grab the later ones...)<br /><br />Assignments:<br />1. Need to complete Google Digital Garage online course. Submit the certificate through Canvas. Some questions to answer after watching each video, but resources are available online. Easy to get full mark. <br /><br />2. Investment portfolio report (3-page) from an equity trading simulation. You need to choose some stocks to invest throughout the semester, and then explain the reasons behind and the stock performance with news and industry reports. Kind of annoying for a student without any financial idea like me. Just add those e-business concepts discussed in class then you'll be fine!",

We had to remind him that we had submitted it and even then, he completely did not grasp what our content was and somehow deviated completely off of what we wrote.

Presentation grading criteria are not very clear and flat among groups. <br /><br />For group project, the task was to build a webpage and made ad on Google (adwords and adsense). However, it is not easy for a newly-establish website to be trusted and it is hard for us to do analytics. Teh did have some methods to analyse but we thought it was somewhere unfair.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload not very high but assignments and exercises come one by one.<br /><br />There are in total 5 assignments, 9 after-class exercises, 5 reading assignments, 1 present with the report, and 1 final exam.<br /><br />The assignments are not difficult to do but come right after every lesson. The lesson ends at around 12:10 every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. However, the after-class assignments were dead at 17:00. It made a huge burden on me as I had another afternoon summer course that ended at around 16:30.<br /><br />For website design, it is pretty easy. We are required to use the Wix platform to complete the web design and suggested using StatCounter for website analytics. Teh is familiar with StatCounter and uses it quite well. However, I think it is not a very popular tool among web developers. And Wix limits many functions that Teh want us to do in the free version while the paid accounts cost tens of dollars.",

The other 30% is understanding the case studies that he presents in class and be able to utilize it in essays in the midterm/final.<br /><br />If you understand how to read and memorize, there will be nothing in this course that will be hard for you.",

He tries to keep his classes 50% slides, 30% videos/discussions and 20% in class assignment.<br /><br />You should always show up in the last hour of the class as that's when he usually hands out the assignment. There's 10 assignments total and you're only allowed to miss 1 of them.",

            "comment_workload": "Braindead easy, but tedious.<br /><br />Remember to check the deadlines for each one as some of them are just two days apart which can be a hassle, if you're doing more than one course at the same time.",
