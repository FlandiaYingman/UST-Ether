Before having the midterm and final exam, the professor will give a review on what to study, basically, you attend that lesson, write down what he said and study accordingly then the mark won't be low. Geeksforgeeks will help you a lot on some of the exam questions (for this semester it is helpful, but not sure if it is applicable to all).",

The content of the homework explanation was not very relevant to the content of the homework. In addition, I once sent an e-mail to ask about homework, but TAs did not reply to me at all. When someone asked TAs to postpone the deadline for assignments, the professor responded to us after a week, 12 hours before the deadline. I don’t know if it’s the efficiency issue of TAs.",

The time for both examinations were tight and the scores for each question were not reasonably distributed. Some details accounted for a lot of test scores. Some knowledge professor emphasized in class only required short answers or even not appear in the test paper. And some questions were out of scope or need some time to think, but the time for the exams was far from enough.<br /><br />In addition, the rules of the exam were not intuitive. We were required to use mobile phones as zoom lenses and need to be turned on from start to finish and also scanned our answers with mobile phones. But it is almost impossible to accomplish these two things with single mobile phone. In addition, we can only refer to paper notes. Why doesn't the professor require to show our screen? Then it doesn't matter if you check the electronic notes.<br /><br />Many grades statistics are not shown. You can't judge whether your grades are good or bad.

Network Security<br /><br />The order of topics is different from the usual networking course, since the professor thinks the concept of &quot;address&quot; is fundamental to understanding the upper layers, i.e. transport layer and application layer.<br /><br />Professor cuts some part in the data link layer in order to make rooms to talk about network security because &quot;the concept of network security is very important to every CSE and ECE students nowadays.&quot;<br /><br />The only downside is the design of the lecture slides.

You should...&quot; I do think the professor needs not to be that blunt. If I were that student, I probably would be quite upset. Still, the professor's explanation is very clear.<br /><br />The teaching of the 3 TAs, however, varies a lot. The female TA speaks quite fast, but her explanation is the clearest among the three. Another two male TAs are, at best, mediocre. Still, I found it interesting when one of the male TA always says &quot;this problem is simple&quot; before every explanation, as if that sentence is his catchphrase.

So textbook can provide more detail about the course material.<br />This course is an introductory course. If you are beginners of computer network, which means you have the following questions in your mind like me before taking this course:<br />(1) Why does the speed(bandwidth) of wireless network in library is slow in the afternoon when there are increasing students?<br />(2) I often heard about http, ip, what are they and what is the difference between them?<br />(3) What do we mean by ip address xx.xx.xx.xx ?<br />Is ip address dynamic or static?<br />(4) How do we surf the internet?<br />(5) What is the difference between host, server, data center?<br />This course will tell you all the answers.<br />However, this course does not cover advanced material like: (1) socket programming(only theory, no programming practice)&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) network security(only talk a few words in the introduction), wireless and mobile network, multimedia networking (in all, none of the last three chapters of the textbook) If you would like to learn more, consider go to COMP course.",

So it is much lighter compared to COMP courses.<br />This semester prof cuts the socket programming assignment (maybe because it is difficult) and replace that 10% with attendance.
