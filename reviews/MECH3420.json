It doesn't involve complex calculation, and no calculus is presented in the calculation. Most of the content are about theory. So it is a quite easy course, suitable for those who are not talented in Math. Some content is related to Mech2410, but not much is required. So feel comfortable to take the course even if you forgot all the content from Mech2410. The hardest chapter is probably ch.6 ceramics, which you need to read both polling, tutorial notes and lecture notes to understand. But overall, it is still not very hard.<br /><br />Chapter 1-Introductionto Engineering Materials II<br />Chapter 2-Electrical properties of engineering materials<br />Chapter 3-Thermal properties of engineering materials<br />Chapter 4-Magnetic properties of engineering materials<br />Chapter 5-Optical properties of engineering materials<br />Chapter 6-Ceramics –crystal structures, properties, and fabrications<br />Chapter 7 -Polymers –structures, properties, synthesis, and applications<br />Chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;8 -Smart Insulation Materials for Buildings<br />Chapter 9-Understanding Aerospace Materials<br />Chapter 10-Aluminum Alloys and Magnesium Alloys for Aerospace Structures<br />Chapter 11-Titanium Alloys for Aerospace Structures and Engines<br />Chapter 12-Superalloys for Gas Turbine Engines<br />Chapter 13–Materials degradation and Non-destructive Monitoring of Aerospace materials",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is good. Prof. Tao Hong also taught me Mech2410. She explain clearly for the content. And even if you missed some of the content, you can still refer to lecture notes without any difficulties. I think the lecture notes are quite well made that it explain the concept clearly. After each lesson, there will be a polling section consist of 4 question. The polling are just for the professor to know how much of the content you understand. It will not be counted toward your grade or for taking attendance. So feel free to make mistake. But it is still a good opportunity for you to check your concept. Also, the professor is very kind. During the end of semester, we has one last quiz in the study break, but the deadline conflicts with the progress report presentation of FYP. So we ask whether she can postpone the deadline, and she did! She gave us 2 extra day for the quiz, so nice!<br /><br />The tutorial, however, are quite boring. The TA just simply read out the tutorial notes. However, the tutorial notes are well made as well, so you must read and try the question in the notes even if you don't want to attend the tutorials.",
            "comment_grading": "This course has 3 assignment, 6 quiz, mid-term and final exam. The assignment format are similar to mech2410 which can be done in hours. The 6 quiz are on canvas. They consist of MC question, fill in the blank and simple calculation. The calculation won't be hard.<br /><br />Assignment (total 3): 15%<br />Online quiz (total 6): 24%<br />Mid-term exam: 25%<br />Final exam: 36%<br /><br />The grading is quite evenly distributed, so even if you fail to get a good score in one of them, you still have a chance to ace in other part to get a decent grade. However, since the course content is not hard, and the mid-term and final exam are even more easier, the mean are relative high. The means are:<br /><br />Assignment: 269.6/300 (89.9%)<br />Quiz: 500/600 (83.3%)<br />Mid-term: 78.8%<br />Final exam: 72.5%<br />Overall: 79.28%<br /><br />The mid-term has 20 MC questions and 4 short answer question. It last for 80mins. The coverage is ch.1-5. The MC question are quite easy. And short answer do not involve complex calculation as well. So overall, the mid-term is easy. In fact, it is even easier than assignment and quiz. You even has time remain to double check each question.<br /><br />For final exam, it has 30 MC questions and 4 short answer which last for 2 hours. The coverage is ch.6-13. It is quite easy as well. It is also easier than assignment and quiz. Most of the question don't involve calculation. If they do, they can be done in short period amount of time.<br /><br />My grade:<br />Assignment 1: 100/100<br />Assignment 2: 100/100<br />Assignment 3: 99/100<br /><br />Quiz 1: 100/100<br />Quiz 2: 85/100<br />Quiz 3: 75/100<br />Quiz 4: 100/100<br />Quiz 5: 100/100<br />Quiz 6: 100/100<br /><br />Mid-term: 89/100<br />Final exam: 88/100<br />Overall: 91.28%<br /><br />Final grade: A+<br />Quite good grade.",
            "comment_workload": "There are not much workload. The 3 assignment are not hard to do. And the time given for the assignment is quite long. For the quiz, you need to study hard since the weighting is similar to mid-term. It usually consist of 8-10 question, includes MC question, fill in the blank and simple calculation. It will be automatically graded. The quiz questions are very similar to the mid-term and final exam, I think some of them are the same. So you should take a screen shot for each question for revision when doing the quiz since the solution will note be shown after you submitted. To be noticed that each quiz only has 20mins to do, and you cannot return to the previous question once you go to the next question. So you need to control your time. The quiz are usually due in 4 days after posted on canvas.",

Please be aware of it.<br /><br />Since you are not anymore required to take this course, and had the patience to read till here, my warm suggestion is not to take the course unless you are 150% sure you want to do material related stuff in the future.",
            "comment_workload": "She gives about 1 homework each week and make sure you ask who came up with the homework. If it is from Sherry Chen, then god bless you. The TAs are overall nice with the homework and you can most of the time find the solutions online.<br /><br />What is awful about this course is that Sherry Chen, as a very random professor, might come up with some &quot;practical&quot; essay homework to help you understand the materials better. Of course it was not in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. But as she says: &quot;whatever&quot;.",
