        "description": "This course seeks to equip students with persuasive communication skills, both oral and written, through analyzing business cases and presenting solutions to problems identified. It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement.",

I don’t know how she graded in the past, but to those who are reading this, you are lucky as she will leave UST after 2020 fall, meaning you will never meet her in the next semester.",

Lack of examples and explanations.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have the feeling that he doesn't put the learning of students at the top priority (just personal feeling, no offence).&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I say so is that I need to ask him again and again about the grading, comments and improvements etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the grade and comment for the first presentation is released 1 week before the second presentation, which makes me difficult to improve accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation reports have the similar situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The grade and comment for the first report is released less than 1 week before the due date of the second one. And again, not much time to improve accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that his comment is vague, say like &quot;projection of voice is clear, pronunciation is good&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Labu course, not a language course!!!!",
            "comment_grading": "Grading of Labu 2040 is curved across all sections, ie students taught by different tutors and marked by different tutors will be curved together for the final letter grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although William Lee said the presentations which have been recorded and reports will be double marked by different tutors, I doubt this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are some classes which the marks for presentations are released before my class even started presenting!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;How can it be double marked in such a case???&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why grading is unfair in my opinion with different standards by different tutors.<br />William Lee's grading is awful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all students in my class got 5 out of 7 in all categories for presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the ability of students in the whole class be that similar??&nbsp;&nbsp;He also once mentioned &quot;I only gave one or two 7 marks across all my 4 sessions&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am absolutely sure other tutors give more 7 marks then he did.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the performance of my class was really not that outstanding, but all 4 classes taught by him did not perform well??&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really questionable.",

Basic steps/frameworks for case analysis were covered, and there were guiding tasks for identifying the causes and issues, but from my experience, the grade mainly depends on your presentation and language skills. Don't expect the solutions to be grand and innovative.",
            "comment_teaching": "Nora is extremely friendly and anyone can feel that she genuinely cares for her students. She is very conversational and engaging during class. For those who want to participate, she always welcomes input and encourages you to talk. For those who don't want to talk, or are a bit less engaged to begin with, she won't cold call or pressure you either, so her classes are generally comfortable and fun to attend.<br /><br />Honestly, there's not much new content to teach in this class, so Nora didn't teach anything especially amazing. However, she did a perfect job going through all the necessary prep tasks to get us ready for the case assignments and always kept us ahead of schedule. I appreciated that she always pushed us to finish our drafts or practise videos way in advance and gave us detailed feedback before our final submission. She also dedicated many lessons for consultation, which were very helpful.<br /><br />One minor issue is that she has very specific taste on the solutions, language and presentation style. During our consultations, I felt that she sort of led everyone towards the same set of solutions and wordings, so there wasn't much space to think and explore on our own. But her solutions generally made sense, and she gave clear instructions on how to express the solutions she had in mind, so it wasn't that big of an issue for me.<br /><br />Anyways Nora is easily the most caring and friendly instructor I've met at UST, I have no complaints about her personally at all.",
            "comment_grading": "As with any other LANG course, grading and curves are always a mystery. From my experience (and some guessing and comparing), I think Nora's grading is not bad, to say the least, and in my case, it was pretty good. Maybe it's because she's pretty strict with the task marks (so the final grade came as a pleasant surprise).<br /><br />I think on average I got 6 out of 7 for most of the criteria, with only two 6.5s and one 7. I also missed some small task during the semester and got an A in the end, which is pretty good considering my raw scores. <br /><br />I found her taste/preferences a bit confusing at times, but I tried to ask for as much advice and clarification as possible and the grades turned out great in the end. Echoing one of the other reviews here about Nora, I do agree that she can feel if you put in effort, and effort seems to generally pay off with Nora.",
            "comment_workload": "Standard LANG course workload, maybe even a bit less. When compared to my friend's instructors from other sections, Nora seemed to assign us more small tasks (drafts, prep tasks, practise videos) throughout the semester, so it felt a bit more intense. But all of these tasks are helpful (either for getting a better grade or getting tasks done in advance), so I didn't mind them too much.",

Mainly just talking about marking scheme, but the marking scheme of case 1 and case 2 is the same, so mainly talking rubbish.",
            "comment_grading": "The worst part about this course. Her grading is very tough, and I can't make out her logic on grading. For example, she especially like to emphasize on hand gestures and seems to pay less attention to the actual content and the visual aids. To add insult to injury, her grading is extremely slow. When I'm writing the report for Case 2, she still haven't given us the grading for Case 1. I seriously don't know how to get a good grade in this course without feedback.",

If you don't have good teammates, I don't know how you are going to carry yourself and your team.

He really likes responsive and engaging students who answer his questions and give out comments during classes. However, his emails often missed out on some information or attachments of the cases, or some mistakes, which confused the whole class. So you better email him if you have any concerns about the cases you will be having in his class.",
            "comment_grading": "Nick likes subtle details about the solutions you are presenting, it was very difficult to include many details and planning within the short 12-min presentation, without speaking very fast (which he hates it). Very frustrating. He is also the course head of LABU so he is very strict about the performance of your presentations. It is hard to score a good, high mark from him, unless you have ways to impress him.",
            "comment_workload": "This course requires very heavy attention and effort if you are not talented in presentations and want to get a good grade. As you can see from the contents, there are 2 mini cases and big cases, as well as 1 report and tons of reflection writing. He also requires you to have a practice presentation for the 2 big cases, so you have to be prepared all the time, and ask for his feedback and comments. I don't recommend enrolling in LABU 2040 if you are planning to have a 18-credit semester, as this course is fking tiring with no breaks. Work piles and tasks were never-ending, presentation after presentation until the start of final exam study break.",

Strategies and approaches to tackle different cases and different audiences. It also gives practice on working well with your team and having good synergy.",
            "comment_teaching": "I like her teaching style. For the most of it, on classes she just explains a few things briefly and gave us directions on how to tackle the case as well as presenting them. After she finished explaining we can just work with our group freely while following her guidance from earlier which will cumulatively contribute to our projects, mainly the oral presentations rather than the writing report. She is also very reasonable if you wanna negotiate or argue for a grade raise.",
            "comment_grading": "I got really good marks (almost full band) on both my oral presentations. For the writing report I initially got vg/vg/ex but request for a raise with sufficient argument and was raised to vg/vg-ex/ex. My team also asked for a raise on our second oral presentation and she gave us the raise. She actually provides session for us to ask for a grade raise if we'd like and as long as we give valid and strong reasoning she will most likely give us the raise. I got A+ and a lot of students in my class got A range. But then again she did say our section was exceptionally good compared to other sections. Grading is absolute BTW.",
            "comment_workload": "It has proper workload. She gave 2 in class quizzes which were basically free points. The writing report was probably the one that took the most labor, as it is individual, but still very ok I think. The oral presentations were group based and definitely needs several meetings and preparations but I think it is ok. It is not a difficult course but you definitely need to spend time and effort working on your projects as well as coordinating with groupmates.",

You could ask him questions regrading assignments and the course, but don't expect him to give you personal feedback for the report which I believe is paramount to the final letter grade.<br /><br />As for the teaching, Jason did a pretty good job in making comments on what we should bear in mind in writing the report. However, it still comes down to whether you can execute the proper 'tone' emphasized by Jason (I guess this is where the English matters part kicks in).",
            "comment_grading": "Overall: Um... As the title summarizes, personally speaking, it is a little disappointing. Fyi, I transferred credits for the English language courses, and according to my academic advisor, she told me this course depends heavily on your English level, but according to my experience, it takes much more than that. Good English is not enough. You also have to have the right tone and register for the report and make good presentations to secure A range I believe. More importantly, since the class size is small (less than 20 students), you can imagine even a minor discrepancy in each of your graded work could result in a difference of a sub grade.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br />Case 1&amp;2 quizzes (credit on submission): submitted<br />Attendance (80% is required): full attendance<br />For oral presentations, the scale is as follows (in descending order):<br />Excellent, Very Good, Competent, Satisfactory, Marginal, Unsatisfactory<br />Oral Presentation 1: <br />1. Task Completion (30%) VG <br />2. Organization &amp; Teamwork (20%): VG/Comp<br />Recommendation report:<br />Task completion: Satisfactory/Marginal<br />Organization: Competent<br />Language use: Competent<br /><br />Final letter grade: B",
            "comment_workload": "It wasn't high for me. But if you aim for A range, you should definitely start working earlier and put in more effort. I think you have to nail the report plus both presentations. So I will briefly talk about what you can do to get a better grade (maybe what I should have done lol), you can take it as a reference, especially if Jason's your instructor.<br /><br />For the report, make good use of the consultation session with Jason by coming to it prepared. Don't be like me and deadline fight the report and not being able to get feedback from Jason. It will be the only chance for you to get his feedback, as Jason is fair to all students and would not give you personal feedback outside of the consultation sessions he set up for everyone. <br /><br />For the first case presentation, focus on the oral part. Our group got Jason's comment the ppt slides were too eye catching (should've not made the ppt slides instead). And since we did it on Zoom, make sure the video featuring your faces is big enough. Ours were too small for Jason (we used Zoom's recording feature).<br /><br />For the second case presentation, we get to do it in person. Everyone was pretty nervous haha. So be sure to rehearse it thoroughly so you won't stutter and can be confident in front of an audience of 10 people. <br /><br />I think that's pretty much it for the workload. Though there're still quizzes regrading the cases, it isn't that time-consuming as long as you have read the case. But since this course is group project based, having responsive group mates would make a big difference. Jason requires the class to work with different classmates for the 2 cases. You can probably imagine pairing up with competent group mates would make a huge difference. Final words would be Jason indeed seems nice, but the grading could be pretty harsh as the class size is pretty small, so put in effort just like for other courses to avoid poor grades.",

Unless you end up with a free-rider or someone hard to work with, since group presentations make up a high percentage of your grade, and everyone in your group gets the same grade—you're not marked individually.<br /><br />There're some online quizzes (to test your knowledge about the cases and stuff) but those are all based on participation so everyone would get the full mark for those.<br /><br />There's also a &quot;Written Report&quot; where you detail the recommendation for case 1 in a formal business manner. This accounts for 28% of your grade or so.",

Umm before I took this course I saw many comments saying this instructor teaching is good and give leng grade blablabla.... but I did not experience any of that.<br /><br />During lessons I think we went off-track quite often and in the end had to rush through several topics without clear clarification or in-depth discussion on those topics, which is very problematic as you have to figure out how to do several major tasks on your own. <br />If you got any problems you can find him or email him but do not expect too much as I found him to be quite unresponsive to students' concerns.",

However sometimes the comments/feedbacks on how to improve your body language are just ridiculous/vague (move your fingers? Spread them open? Move them closer?) <br /><br />The brainstorming sessions on how to solve certain issues or dissecting a case are sometimes hit or miss. Sometimes she wants a very specific solution/answer, but as we all know there are definitely more than one answers for certain problems right? So she just goes about the class asking each group a question, just waiting for this one specific word.<br /><br />Oh and what drives me nuts is how brand/image is somehow different? Come on it's more or less interchangeable. Just how she teaches or guides students to a certain specific solution for a case study is very frustrating.",
            "comment_grading": "I don't want to come off as salty, but I feel Nora's grading is a tad biased. I personally believe my presentation skills are pretty decent, natural and I look confident/persuasive. But I swear she gives the try=hards a better grading, even though their solution is just as full of shit as everyone else's, and their presentation skill/English isn't all that great. It is especially tough to stand out on the curve when everyone else are native speakers too, and within the add-drop period there have been so many that drop cuz they just can't match the level of English. So be careful. <br /><br />Oh and like most soft-skill classes instead of exams that test hard-knowledge, grading is subjective. Even though your solution is valid (and honestly every bloody consulting solution that uni students come up with is vague as fuck anyways), she might not like it or it isn't the specific one she had in mind and therefore your grade drops cuz the application/solution &quot;doesn't work&quot; in her mind.",

After the first presentation and writing, he would provide detailed feedback on why he will give you that particular score, which is fair and transparent.<br /><br />To score high, you must be a little bit more proactive in class.

Good group mates are important also as it will help you a lot in brainstorming ideas and preparing presentation.",

Most locals have a pretty shitty English fluency (no offence) and you'll need to put in some extra effort to make sure what they're saying actually makes sense (50% of the presentation grade is a group grade).

It depends a lot on the packaging of the group's ideas. It kicks off with two mini-cases to show how things are done in the LABU way. It's all about finding the problems of companies and brainstorming ways to improve the situation, just like consultants. Having some passionate teammates is needed and I'm more than lucky to find them. It's randomly assigned so you guys might wanna find at least a dozen reliable friends to register for the same class. If you are lucky enough, then you may even find some new friends in this course and study together. (I found some local friends for lunch reunions this semester.)",

(If you are an INTROVERT who doesn't like a bit of mocking, then you really need to step up to tell Levi to stop, I REALLY MEAN IT.) This makes our class less stressful despite the demanding workload. He cares a lot about our class. He had a lot of group consultations in breakout sessions and guided us throughout class time. Through his guidance, a clearer picture of the group project could be seen. Get a lot of guidance when needed. Passionate and helpful overall. Btw he's local, and I was caught speaking Cantonese during breakout sessions, just fyi.",

For example, under the written reports, one of the assessed criteria is organization. As long as you follow the report sample, there should be no problem in scoring full score in that criteria.<br /><br />On the other hand, for presentations, it will be very hard to see drastic increase between your first presentation and your second presentation as it is very much based on your fluency in English. In order to score high, you must ensure you are fluent in English before taking the course.",

Attendance is taken but I'm unsure to what extent that affects your overall grade. <br /><br />William will babysit you through the preparation of your first presentation, just take ample notes of what he says and you'll be fine. I'm not kidding, he analyzes the case for you, your job is to elaborate on what he says.",

The course sharpens students’ ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills.",
