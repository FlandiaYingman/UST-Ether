            "comment_content": "Although this course is technically a continuation of MATH5311, I think it's more like a PG version of MATH3322. Instead of focusing on how to formulate a numerical method from a PDE (as in MATH5311), this course focuses on algorithms to solve linear systems, such as basic iterative methods (e.g. Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR) or Krylov subspace methods (e.g. conjugate gradient, GMRES).",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Cai provides handwritten notes on each chapter, and during class essentially rewrites and rederives everything on his IPad. The way he teaches this course is exactly the same as how he teaches his other courses (namely MATH3322 and MATH3332).<br /><br />I personally think his notes are quite good and enjoy his teaching style. Although what he covers in the lectures is exactly the same as what he provides in his notes, I still think his lectures are still quite useful since he starts from scratch to explain and introduce the motivation behind the concepts, instead of just reading off their notes like some professors might do.",
