She will take every chance to exploit any interns as their grade and reference letters are in her grasp. She will need you to OT everyday and sometimes even till Sunday 1-2am, but in the end won't use the work that you have done.",
            "comment_teaching": "The UST tutor himself is not helping nor understanding students' situation, and the rules and regulations of this course are completely biased to NGOs. Your pass/fail grade and start/end date are almost solely depends on your NGO supervisor, and the tutor would have an initial bias to NGO partners (e.g. he will say &quot;I have cooperated with your supervisor for a long time and he/she is a good person.&quot;) before listening to any of your concerns. If you are fortunate enough to have a good supervisor then congratulations; however if not, you can do nothing except listening and obeying to your supervisor until the end of your internship, as he/she determines your grade.",
            "comment_grading": "This course only have pass and fail, and it is a 2 credit course, not 4. However, my supervisor will ask me questions like &quot;Do you think I will fail you?&quot; when I didn't do anything bad to the company or to herself. Generally supervisors in this course will not fail you if you didn't do anything destructive, but it is not guaranteed, only depends on who you met.",
            "comment_workload": "Extremely heavy. I would rather study one to two more subjects while in school instead of going to HKFYG to work. HKFYG always organize events which the manpower needed is very far exceed what they have. Thus, they will exploit interns and volunteers to help them get work done. No leaves (not even sick leave) are expected to take, and in my case, you won't be given any leave even though you have worked on weekends, while the supervisor will take leaves.",

            "comment_teaching": "urrrr冇咩好講，基本上你係學校申請完，學校可能screen左次（但我估除非份cv真係好差，如果唔係基本上都係全部applicant都dump哂過去比NGO揀架啦）對方機構會再叫你去interview多次，in完佢會自己contact你幾時可以開始番工，咁我當個老細就話覺得翻耐d先可以學多d野，於是就叫我早少少（十二月尾）開始返工返到一月底，所以實際上係多過一個月／成個winter semester嘅日期，其他學生就唔好咁傻比呢d語言藝術呃到啦<br /><br />然後成個working period你都唔會同學校有任何contact,科大係唔會比任何support你，直至個program完結，個instructor就會約你傾下計，問下intern做成點，學到乜，評論下自己嘅表現",

Tbh, it is a very nice experience and internship for year 1 students since most of the year 1 students wont get internship experience. It will be a great stepping stone for getting more internship experience. <br /><br />The course is quite nice, dont be faked by other review XD since I think the course changed quite a lot (not sure haha).",

The interview is not that difficult and the main point is you have to show your passion in NGO or in the value of the NGO you choose to achieve. It will be better if you can show your relevant volunteer experience.",

This was great to me as a year 1 freshman who just experienced one virtual semester. However, to be honest, for non-year1 students, the internship experience in SBMT 2200 might not be useful enough since my works were mainly about administration and sometimes marketing. This is not professional enough for non-year1 students no matter in skillset learning or on the CV.",

            "comment_workload": "The workload is light. For those NGOs having a well-established structure. the works are usually planned by the supervisor. For those NGOs having a shorter history, the works are usually more sudden but limited. In my internship experience, usually there was one task for a day. Therefore, the light workload does not mean a good thing in this case. Since by a month, the knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned did not deserve such a long time.",
