        "description": "IoT (Internet of Things) is the key enabling technology for many integrative systems. A design thinking-led approach is used to motivate and engage students to design IoT systems, leading to user-centric solutions. Through the design of IoT systems, students learn fundamental theories and gain hands-on working experience on several key components for IoT systems, including circuits and sensors, signal processing, embedded systems, and communication and networking. In the final project, students will apply design thinking approach to meet the project requirements, specified from usersâ€™ perspective.",
