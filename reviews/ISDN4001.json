        "description": "This course is the first part of the final year project course. Students will continue to expand their skills in technical and design elements as well as knowledge about marketability, sustainability and manufacturability of their product solutions via this project. Students will be assigned into a team and they will define their own project. They will formulate a project proposal to demonstrate project feasibility from a technical and business perspective and seek approval through a proposed project presentation. Students will be given resource and time constraints to complete project milestones under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Regular project meetings will be held to track progress. Each student in a group will be responsible to lead one key element for a successful outcome. A first semester final presentation will update faculty advisors, other ISD faculty and mentors on the project progress and future development plans. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
