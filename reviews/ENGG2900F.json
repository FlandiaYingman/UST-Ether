        "description": "The YMCA Bridges Street Centre, built in 1918, is a 6-storey redbrick construction that was accorded Grade 1 status by the Antiquities Advisory Board in 2009.  Formerly used as the headquarters of the Chinese YMCA, the Centre is now mainly used for Rehabilitation Service. It currently houses the Home of Love Hostel and Home of Love Sheltered Workshop to provide accommodations and employment opportunities to the mentally handicapped. After years in services, the building is currently facing water leakage problems due to material aging and cracking.  In this community services project, we will study a new approach for waterproofing of the building roof, based on the use of fiber reinforced mortar as buffer between the concrete roof-top and conventional repair material to prevent cracks in the concrete from penetrating into the waterproofing layer to render it ineffective. In this course, students will learn about the history of the building and the services provided by the Home of Love.  Arrangements will be made for them to talk to the mentally handicapped residents to see how water leakage affects their daily life and work.  On the technical side, there will be lectures covering conventional waterproofing approach and design of the fiber reinforced mortar, as well as site visits to expose students to the current practice of building waterproofing.  A major part of the course will be on the design and conduction of laboratory experiments, under the guidance of research students, to study the waterproofing capabilities provided by various compositions of the fiber reinforced mortar.  At the end of the semester, we hope to identify a cost-effective composition suitable for waterproofing of the YMCA building. Students must obtain prior approval from course coordinator for enrolling in the course. Graded P or F.",
