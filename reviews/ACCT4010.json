However, as this was the very first time he taught the course, he was not very familiar with the course materials and sometimes made some mistakes in the class.

Nevertheless, Peter has shown his passion in teaching and worked hard to explain those complex entries and concepts. :)",

The level of difficulty is moderate and as long as you have tried the questions in the textbook, you shall be fine.

Peter only teaches the basic method on how to arrive on those figures, but the textbook will elaborate on other methods.",
            "comment_teaching": "Because consolidation is very complicated, Peter encourages us to attend every lecture. He knows the concepts and methodologies well, but his English is not so good, and one can easily doze off, especially in the afternoon. He follows the PPT strictly, but he will happily answer any questions you raise throughout class. After a lot of lecturing, he will give out handouts for us to practice in-class. But his time management is not so good, so sometimes he rushes in the end.",

Peter mentioned that he would like us to finish them in-class, but in the end, he would let us take the exercises home and hand them in next class.<br />40% is for the mid-term, and it covered the first 5 chapters. Closed book, but can bring cheat sheet.<br />45% is for the final, non-cumulative. But a lot of the content after the midterm is built upon the content of previous sessions. Open-book, so label your book and notes carefully to quickly find the entries needed. Time is tight for both exams. Make sure you print the handouts and solutions too because the finals will feature the exact questions.<br />Peter won't fail anyone, but accounting courses are extremely competitive in UST so try your best.",
