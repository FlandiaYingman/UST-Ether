        "description": "This course hones students’ ability to “do economics”: to apply economic concepts and reasoning to real-world phenomena,and to express that application clearly and convincingly in writing. In weekly large-class settings, students will work with an economics instructor on interpreting and explaining data, applying economic principles to daily life, building and supporting an argument, and evaluating different perspectives in scholarly debates. In weekly small-group tutorials, a language instructor will lead discussions to analyse texts and workshop individual students’ writing. At the end of the course students will be better prepared to undertake independent research and writing in their economics coursework, as well as to write from an economics perspective for a range of non-academic purposes. For BBA(ECON), BSc(ECOF) and BSc(MAEC) first and additional majors students.",
