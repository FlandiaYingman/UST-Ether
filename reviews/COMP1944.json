        "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting every sphere of our work and lives, bringing unprecedented risks to society. This introductory course surveys the explosive area of AI ethics, illuminating relevant AI concepts with no prior background needed. Fake news bots. AI driven social media displacing traditional journalism. Drone warfare. Elimination of traditional jobs. Privacy‐violating advertising. Monopolistic network effects. Biased AI decision/recognition algorithms. Deepfakes. Autonomous vehicles. Automated hedge fund trading. No area remains untouched. Policy think tanks, governments, and tech companies around the world have started paying serious attention to AI ethics. How will human civilization survive the rise of AI? What are the new rules? What are the ethical frameworks needed to avoid extinction? What are engineers’ and entrepreneurs’ ethical responsibilities?",

I would like to thank Dekai for enlightening me, because Neuro-sama is now my wife.<br /><br />Bonus: He teaches some actual ethics<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Usually the lectures will follow a formula.<br />1) Unscheduled Dekai rant on random topic<br />2) Watch Dekai's TED talk<br />While loop:<br />3) He asks us for our opinions, you raise your hand to speak out to the class.<br />4) Other classmates will respond to your comments, and the chain continues until Dekai doesn't like one of the takes and begins debating with that one student.<br /><br />Judging off of purely the contents, the best parts of this course are the discussions we have. He brings up issues and we discuss. Wish we just skipped all the foreplay so we had time for longer and better discussions. But this part of the course which I liked isn't really sunshine and rainbows either (read Grading).",
            "comment_teaching": "Dekai is legitimately a very active teacher. There is never any dead air like the other profs in UST and you won't be bored. He is the type of teacher who would explain everything in great detail.<br /><br />Problem is he talks about things that are COMPLETELY UNRELATED to the &quot;syllabus materials&quot;. He does not explain what AI means until mid semester, he does not introduce ethics terms until late semester. The first few weeks of the course consisted 30 mins of rants about the latest AI trends. The one I remember the most was on Elon Musk buying out Twitter. He dragged this on for so long because someone replied to him with a different POV. Isn't this a credit bearing course? We have a midterm right? Can we please get back to the planned contents? <br /><br />Discussion is a very big part of the course. I did not talk too much when compared to the rest of the class. Some students are very active and I enjoy listening to their opinions. Dekai's comments, are very biased to (that particular side).<br /><br />Small rant:<br />Dekai went for a &quot;United Nations&quot; meeting and we skipped 2 weeks of lessons, and he comes back telling us we need to come for lecture at 7:30AM. We thought it would be on Zoom, but NO you have to come back F2F, and remember, if you don't come back, no participation score, bad grade gg. (My friend lives on the other side of HK, he has to wake up at 5 for Dekai).<br /><br />Also, there was one lesson where he just &quot;decided&quot; to not show up, I only had his lesson that day, what a waste of my bus fare and time.",
            "comment_grading": "Participation, Quiz, Homework, Midterm, Final Project(Video)<br /><br />I'm not rating it lower for grading just because it is very easy to rig the system to get yourself higher grading. Otherwise, the grading for this course is disgustingly unfair.<br /><br />For the midterm, remember to study on the different ethics terms. if you pay enough attention during class, you would have learnt basic bullshitting skills, and you'll probably be fine finishing the midterm with good scores. If you have done DSE, the question type is similar to Liberal Studies data-based questions.<br /><br />================<br />Examples:<br />Q1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox News Article reporting on Facebook Whistleblower <br />- What the inherent biases seen in this report, and what are the consequences of reporting like this?<br /><br />Q2:&nbsp;&nbsp;Some researcher's thesis<br />- Why AI cannot do critical tasks such as judgement?<br /><br />Q3:&nbsp;&nbsp;Report on Google's ethical board not including African Americans<br />- Do you think representation is important in such companies' ethical boards? Argue based on either one: deontological, virtue ethics, consequentialist<br />================<br /><br />For the final video, make sure you stand out. He never tells us what the marking rubric was, and I still to this day dunno how I did for my video.<br /><br />Homework is very simple. Just need to read some articles and find biased arguments. (I still don't know how that directly relates to learning about AI ethics but ok).<br /><br />Quizzes are not quizzes. They are questionnaires from Dekai about stuff like your decisions on the trolley problem. For one particular quiz, we had to watch a Netflix documentary at home, come back and take a quiz on the contents of the documentary. Some of us are poorL and don't have Netflix.<br /><br />A large chunk of the course grade is class participation. This leads to very unfair grading. Here is why.<br /><br />1) If you are not comfortable talking in front of the class, even if you have a lot you want to say, you will never get the chance to participate. Hence, bad grade gg.<br />2) If your reaction time is not above upper quartile, Dekai will forget that you have raised your hand and you will never get the chance to speak. Hence, bad grade gg.<br />3) If you raise your hand for too long, Dekai will forget that you raised your hand and you will never get the chance to speak. Hence, bad grade gg.<br />4) The class time is very short, if someone argues with Dekai for too long, everyone will lose their chance to participate, and you will never get the chance to speak. Hence, bad grade gg.<br /><br />If you REALLY want to take this course, here are some tips:<br />A) Whatever you say does not matter, just raise your hand as soon as you have the chance. <br />To put into perspective:<br />- Well thought out argument: 1pt<br />- Repeating ideas: 1pt<br />- Water is wet argument: 1pt<br /><br />B) If someone begins arguing with Dekai, don't wait for your turn and just jump in and argue with them. It helps with the discussion anyway to have more people talking. The best discussions we've had are always the ones with the whole class arguing, no regard for raising hand. Remember to say who you are before talking and you'll still get the pt. <br /><br />C) Agreeing with Dekai will shorten the time you spend your turn, and will give your fellow classmates more chance to get their point. Also Dekai will have a good impression of you.<br /><br />D) Remember to check if the TA recorded your mark last lecture correctly at the start of the lecture.<br /><br />We've had pretty good discussions this semester, hearing my classmates' hot takes on topics like AI uprising definitely helped me gather better perspectives on these issues.<br /><br />But sorry this is all credit bearing, and Dekai's grading system is rigged. Don't ruin your grade for some &quot;good discussions&quot;. <br /><br />Follow these suggestions and you'll survive.",

The professor attributed this to the spike of Facebook controversies during the semester.<br /><br />Issues investigated with reasonable effort:<br />• Creative AIs<br />• Strong AIs<br /><br />Issues investigated with insufficient effort:<br />• Artificial children<br />• Artificial gossips<br />• Prescriptive/descriptive and deontological/consequentialist/virtue ethics<br />• AIs and weapons<br /><br />Kind of useful concepts (but made shallow effort to cover them): Trolley problem, Scissor statement<br /><br />Case study: Current news (e.g. Covid vaccines, Facebook)<br />• A LOT OF COURSE HOURS (equivalent to 5-6 complete lectures) originally intended for lectures on important concepts were spent to discuss tech news (with the most emphasis on controversies of Facebook), a significant amount of which was irrelevant to AI ethics (e.g. TRUTH Social, Apple VS Epic, China's crackdown on how long kids can play mobile games per week, you name it)<br /><br />Remarks: I use &quot;investigated&quot; above because the professor didn't come up with a takeaway message after the discussion in each lecture, and you have to come up with your own. <br /><br />The course description did say, &quot;This course critically surveys AI ethics ...&quot; The course greatly achieved the intended learning outcomes on analysis of AI ethics, but failed to achieve the rest (comparison of existing AI ethics frameworks, propose designs for an ethically aligned system, ...).",

He tries to persuade you to think that<br />• the media is biased against vaccines; and<br />• MAMAA (except Microsoft) are evil and untrustworthy.<br /><br />Lectures mostly involved discussion on ethical issues related to AI and analysis of recent news. Very few concepts that aid analysis were taught. There wasn't enough evidence to rate how he 'taught', but if you take part in the discussions during the lessons, he can inspire you to investigate the problem from a deeper perspective. Oh, and classes often overran. <br /><br />P.S. To those who read the reviews of COMP4901M (the former code of this course) and COMP4221, the professor is finally willing to share his slides to everyone after the class!<br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />TA: Serkan Kumyol<br />The TA’s English couldn’t be understood by at least half of the class.

Expect a lower weighting though.<br /><br />In-class exercises (20%)<br />Group assignments (20%)<br />Mid-term exam (10%)<br />Final group presentation (25%)<br />See Workload for the details of the above items.<br /><br />My grades: The grades in the above components weren't announced (except the participation score).

Almost all of them weren't used in the lectures except the one that introduce them, despite being &quot;required readings&quot;… Some are really inspiring and worth reading though.<br /><br />In-class exercises: Just fill in the Google forms (only 2 in this semester) that he asked you to. They're simple to complete.<br /><br />Group assignments: Light. Create a mind map on Covid vaccines memes (and news) and revise it around once per month. The only task in which you may struggle is following the format.<br /><br />Mid-term exam: Write as many short essays (12 to choose from, some have higher scores than others) as you can. Each one is hard enough. Worse still, some are on topics that aren’t even discussed in the class, so there's no way to prepare for them except reading a lot…<br /><br />Final group presentation: Medium. Convert some nodes on your mind map into HTML NEWS ARTICLES (1-2 each) and do a 5-minute presentation on all of them in class. Lighter if you know how to write HTML documents natively.",

            "comment_teaching": "Each week we cover a different aspect of AI ethics and society, with the class structured in two halves.<br /><br />The first half begins with a short provocation such as a TED talk, to create a controversial context for discussion and debate. We then review the relevant literature, illuminate major concepts, and critique them. The first half finishes with a questionnaire/quiz that tests your understanding and poses self-reflection challenges.<br /><br />The second half exercises these concepts. We may do case studies, breakout groups, collaborative mind mapping, and other interactive work to help concretize, explore, and internalize the issues and challenges. Individual contributions to these exercises over the course of the semester are a large part of the assessment for the course.<br /><br />Provocative content, <br />Discussion-based",
