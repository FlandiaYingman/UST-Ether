The first unit looks at greetings, introduction, and daily conversations. The second unit is all about numbers (counting, date, prices). The last unit is harder and looks at making telephone calls, your likes and dislikes, food, and hobbies. <br /><br />In my opinion, it is not too difficult altogether, and the previous units give you a good base for the last unit.",
            "comment_teaching": "My teacher was amazing. She not only taught us the syllabus but also extra words and phrases. She never stopped us from asking questions even though it used to slow down the class sometimes. Sometimes she has short quizzes about topics covered in the last class, but they are not graded. <br /><br />Resources provided are also very good. Make sure you use CLE website.",

However, five absences may result in an F.<br /><br />I think the grading is ok. Liang Xin told us that she tried to give us as many marks as she could. However, I noticed that in the oral tests the grading was quite harsh. Some international students have difficulty with pronunciation.<br /><br />Assessment 1: Listening - 10/10, Oral - 9.2/10<br />Assessment 2: Listening - 9.5/10, Oral - 18/21<br />Assessment 3: (Scores were not given) <br />Grade: A+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is medium. It really depends on what kind of grade you want. My teacher gave homework from time to time but it took only 15 minutes or so. There aren't any consequences if you don't do the homework but in my experience, doing the homework really helps in the assessments. <br /><br />I recommend that you keep revising the content over the semester, then the assessments become quite easy. After mid-semester, you should also start memorizing characters. Flashcards really helped me with character recognition.",

            "comment_content": "This course is a requirement for all international students and includes basic Mandarin, which can actually prove to be quite helpful. But the content can be very hard to deal with, if not reviewed on a regular basis. <br /><br />The course has 3 units. The first unit looks at greetings, introduction, and daily conversations. The second unit is all about numbers (counting, date, prices). The last unit is harder and looks at making telephone calls, your likes and dislikes, food, and hobbies. <br /><br />In my opinion, the key is to not stall with reviewing the content after every class. It can be very overwhelming to do all the content right before the exam. So to the typical UST student, DO NOT PROCRASTINATE.",
            "comment_teaching": "Emma is actually a great teacher and she has a lot of patience. I took the online version of the class with her in Spring 2020 and she made sure to give personal attention to every kid in the class. <br /><br />Also, she is I think the only prof out of all teaching the course, who gives insights on the examination pattern and what the scoring will be like. That is pretty helpful, and she is also very generous with offering time outside class to help with doubts.",

Participation (10%)<br /><br />The grading is absolute, and you need to score an aggregate of 90% or above to get A or more. I scored a total percentage of around 88% in total and secured an A-, pretty satisfied considering how hard it was for me to get by.",
            "comment_workload": "If you want to score well, you might have to put in effort because you wont be able to just wing it. Taking the online version was definitely a bit easier because we got to record our oral presentations and hence could rerecord if an error was made; opposed to the offline exam where you just get one shot. <br /><br />My advise would be to practice vocabulary after every class for a bit, so you can retain what was taught. I didn't do that, and hence had to do everything at the last moment.",

            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is very fair. The grade heavily depends on how much work you've put in.<br />For the oral tasks, I would highly recommend putting in as much information as possible. Make it longer than the minimum 3 minutes (both of mine were +7min long) because the teacher grades the content section based on the different vocabulary you use. Go through the book thoroughly adding every piece of vocab you can and re-use the grammar examples to get a high score on the grammar section. Additionally, I would recommend starting preparing your oral as soon as possible and putting in a good effort to learn it properly, as a fluent oral will make you win points on the pronunciation/fluency section.<br />The grammar task was quite difficult, you must go through every point covered in the book before hand.<br />Overall, you don't need to worry too much as long as you've worked throughout the semester.<br />Final grade: A",

            "comment_grading": "She definitely understood that students did not really have good tones, so grading was a little more lenient as lone as you tried. Attendance is part of the grade and there about 3 &quot;tests&quot; that factor into your grade. Each test varies but the first one is about 20%, second is 25% and the last one is around 30%.",

She gives plenty of opportunities to ask questions for clarification and you can even email her to ask to see her out of class (though she is often busy with other classes) especially to check your script for the oral assessments.",
            "comment_grading": "The course included 3 assessments and 1 essay on any aspect of Chinese culture. <br /><br />There is a listening section on each assessment worth 10 points each, and the difficulty gradually increased, but if you did the exercises on the CLE website, it should not be too difficult. <br /><br />The first assessment had a pronunciation section where you were given a list of words in pinyin and had to pronounce them correctly. In the second and third assessments, this was replaced with an oral section where you would have to speak for quite a while without a script using words covered in the lesson. It is very hard to get full on the oral assessments but in general, using a lot of words will get you a higher score since it seems they have a list of words from the lesson and record which grammatical structures or vocabularies you use. Each pronunciation or oral section is worth 10 points.<br /><br />The last assessment also included a Chinese character section and a grammar section, each worth 10 points. For the character section, you're given a list of 70 words and you should be able to recognize (though you don't have to write them) all of them. Doing the exercises on the website should be sufficient preparation. The grammar section tested grammar points covered in the book.<br /><br />The essay had to be around 1000 words and could be on anything in Chinese culture and is worth 10 points. <br /><br />In my opinion, it is quite hard to get A+, but it is definitely possible.",
            "comment_workload": "As a LANG course, attendance is mandatory and you can only skip 6 or so lessons without failing. <br /><br />For me, the listening assessments took around 1 hour to prepare for each, but for the oral assessments I needed to prepare a script and this did take a lot of effort.",
