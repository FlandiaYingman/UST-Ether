            "comment_teaching": "The instructor has tried to explain the biological concept with a lot of examples and detailed information. the content is relatively difficult and costs a lot of time especially for those who have no biological knowledge such as cell membrane and the heart. but there is no tutorial session, so the only way is to ask the prof. directly or searching from the internet. <br /><br />some content will not be explained in class which requires you to read the handout. some handout is really long and too difficult to understand.<br /><br />No attendance required. According to the situation, all labs will have videos and data support, attendance for labs is optional.<br /><br />the TAs' response in around 2-3 hours, which is quick enough.",

            "comment_workload": "To be honest, the assignments and labs workload is normal, one assignment per week up to midterm, and one lab report per week starting after the midterm. Total 6 assignments and 6 labs. the most time consuming maybe the first assignment if you are not familiar with Matlab. the code for data analysis used in the assignment will be reused in each lab report. for each report and assignment, around 3 hours will be spent, therefore it is around 3 hours workload per week, which is fair for a 4 cred course. <br /><br /><br />the instructor claim that you just need to have some basic circuits knowledge to study this course, so you do not need to have bio knowledge. <br /><br />but the main problem is the content is not familiar for most of the students which is very difficult. if you really want to understand the course materials, you have to spend a lot of time self-learning and revise. for those who have not much biological knowledge, it is a hard time until you get familiar with the content. therefore, it is not a suitable course for those not interested in this area and not good at bio-content.",
