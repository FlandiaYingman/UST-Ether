Weekly sessions are composed of lectures from different guest lecturers, group meetings and presentations. What's cool about this course is that you get to visit the site during summer to actually implement the project. For my case, I was able to visit Cambodia to implement my hygiene education project.",

            "comment_grading": "My teammates and I worked hard and actively reflected the comments from professors and staffs. So I earned a good grade. However, I also heard from my friends that the grade seemed to be subjective and didn't reflect the efforts they put into their projects.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is quite heavy. You need to consistently put effort to this project throughout the whole semester. I had many more group meetings in addition to the regular weekly meetings during course time. The course consists of several long presentations to report on the plan and progress of the project, final roadshow and a final report.",
