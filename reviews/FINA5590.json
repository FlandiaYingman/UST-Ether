        "description": "This course aims to give participants an insight into finance in action, focusing on the equity market.  The emphasis will be on real life market problems.  Led by a market practitioner, it will look at, amongst other things, how a trading floor works and the different forces and factors that lead to a market behaving in the way that it does.  Students will apply knowledge gained in other courses in practical situations with a distinction on where theory differs from practice, and an emphasis on the needs of market practitioners.",
