        "description": "Information cannot exist without a physical system to represent it. Quantum physics enables some fundamental new ways of information processing. In recent years, quantum information processing (QIP) has emerged as one of the “most fiercely competitive in today’s world of technology”. This course offers an introduction to the past, present and future of QIP. The theme is to explain the major ideas and issues in QIP, and how this new technology will change our understanding of information processing. The course starts from a gentle introduction to quantum theory without assuming any physics background, then moves to the key applications of QIP including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. Besides theory, demonstrations and hands-on experiences with quantum hardware will also be given. Students will benefit from learning quantum information technology in an interdisciplinary environment, with knowledge and skills for comprehending the fast-paced developments in today’s technological world.",

Which is good to let is know more about the differences between traditional and the quantum.<br /><br />However, I gave a B to the contents mainly because of the pre-requisites. WARNING: take this course ONLY if you have taken MATH2111/2121. Best if you are major in Physics with PHYS2022 taken, or if you are major in CS with COMP2611 taken.<br /><br />With M2 as the pre-requisite, umm..., you will be quite confused with all the things taught. The workload for you to grasp an understanding about the contents from zero background is definitely huge.",
            "comment_teaching": "I don’t know how to say. I can feel the Prof teaches with heart, and she is also responsive to students. When we asked her to post hand-written notes, she did post. Also, she is willing to answer students questions during class.<br /><br />However, I personally don’t like her teaching style. She jumps from pages to another, which is hard to follow. She is definitely not the person that can teach students from “zero”. Which means, if you come into the class with background, it would probably be okay; but if you come with blank, you may be really confused with her teaching. Her accent was not too good to comprehend as well.",
            "comment_grading": "Can’t say it is very bad, but I don’t think it is good either.<br /><br />Scheme: <br />5% participation<br />15% weekly canvas quiz (homework)<br />35% midterm exam<br />45% final exam<br /><br />What I got: <br />Total 83.875 with overall mean around 73.<br />I got 13/20 in midterm with mean 13.1 (I will explain more below)<br />I got 27/30 in final with mean 21.6 <br />Full in homework + attendance 20/20 with mean around 19-19.5 I guess.<br /><br />Grade: B+<br />P.S. I have sent an email asking the TA. Cutoff between B+ and A- is 85 (which means one single more question correct in either midterm or final.... cry!!) <br />Should be 5 points a sub-grade, 85-90 A-, 90-95 A... <br /><br />However, I gave C in this criteria for the following two reasons:<br />1. The midterm exam sucks. It is the go-ahead-no-return type canvas quiz. However, some question involves tedious calculation, there is a question asking for the inner product of tensor products of 2x1 matrices with each entry being complex. (Complex numbers mean you need to do the multiplication two times, so you need to do 16 multiplications before having the tensor product on one side; another 16 the another side, then you do another 16 multiplication between the two tensor products and you also need to do 15 additions on both real and complex parts for simplifying. There are 63 steps before you reach an answer.... lol, correct me if I am wrong). Since the exams are open book open internet, students can use any codings to perform the matrix computation. Many used octave; however, I did not know how to use it... I spent quite a lot of time struggling for that question. But I don’t know whether I should skip it or not since I couldn’t come back to check for that question later even I got time left. The midterm exam consists of way too many computational question, which was also the reason for me not performing well on the midterm. I think the mode of assessment did not really comply with the objectives of this course. Isn’t this course “quantum information”?? I thought it was “Coding for Computations” :(<br /><br />2. The grading curve isn’t good neither. I was upset that given many technical difficulties and mistakes in many exams and homeworks, plus this course is brand new that many students did not know the contents in advance when taking it, plus also it is a common core with unreasonable pre-requisites, it is still giving shitty grade. Well, not shitty, but average gradings. It isn’t giving exceptionally better grades; however, it should, given all these.<br /><br />Since HKUST typically says mean is C, I will give the “grading” C here. I think the grading scheme and the distribution, as well as the assessment modes are not really good enough. They are not very worse, but average.<br /><br />Rooms for improvements:<br />1. Allow all-in final<br />2. Don’t include computation questions too much<br />3. Don’t do one-way forward quiz.",
            "comment_workload": "Easy workload. I am thinking even you do not attend class but somehow showed up a bit, you got full in parti.<br /><br />Homeworks are not difficult, you will immediately know your results as they are just Canvas quizzes. You got three attempts where most students got full here.<br /><br />Midterm and Final are intensive given limited time, but tbh the questions are not that difficult if you got time. You have nothing to do in revising for the exams except for the sample paper. I would recommend you go play around with Octave or Matlab before taking the exams. They may even be more useful than practicing with the sample paper.",

Regardless, if you like this sort of stuff you might find the contents pretty interesting. There was a big focus on quantum gates and how quibits would interact with a quantum circuit. Other topics included: Vector and matrix stuff (eigenstuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;hermitian and unitary matrices, tensor product etc), Quantum states, probability, Bits and Quibits, Q gates, various algorithms(Deutsch–Jozsa, Simons, Grovers, etc), cryptography and information theory. The textbook for reference was Quantum computing for computer scientists (Noson S. Yanofsky, Micro A. Manucci), however I did not end up using it that much and instead used the lecture notes, which were also not that great. So I would say that the provided resources could be much better.",

Famous quantum algorithms are explained in details (except for Shor’s algorithm, when I think it should be the climax of this course, it was introduced just very briefly), and they might be very useful in the future(?)<br /><br />Mathematics prerequisite includes complex number and linear algebra. Basically all maths needed would be introduced in the first two weeks. Overall the problems are not very difficult and everything in homework and exams can be done with the help of MATLAB / Octave. But it is still good if you have a basic understanding in the maths before you take this course (e.g. complex number in polar form, vector basis and linear dependence, eigenvectors and eigenvalues). Year 1 BB like me may have to take a look at these concepts first.<br /><br />The textbook is not particularly good, as it sometimes uses some very weird conventions that make readers confused.

She explained those examples quite clearly, and it should not be difficult to follow her and finish the homework. But as a matter of fact, concepts in quantum physics are difficult to truly understand, so sometimes you may just be able to do all the maths, but you don’t know what is actually happening.

It was not very difficult, so the mean scores were usually very high. Try your best to get full score. Make sure you have saved your attempts (screen-capturing or printing-to-PDF) before you submit, so that you can revisit your answers if your score is not full.<br /><br />For mid-term and final, there were both MCs and numeric questions. They were more difficult than homework problems. The difficulty was increased by adding more qubits to the circuit, setting some variables instead of numbers in questions, etc. But overall the style was somewhat similar to homework problems. For online exam mode, please get used to Octave before you take the exam, as it can speed up your calculation a lot. Dealing with the matrix multiplication by hand can be troublesome.<br /><br />Eventually I got an A+. Some said that a mean score gives a B.

            "comment_content": "The course has been simplified compared to last year and has become a true &quot;for everyone&quot; course in Quantum Information. Also I think it contains a good introduction to modern computer architecture as well. But I do agree that this may be a little difficult for year 1 students.",
            "comment_teaching": "This was probably my favourite course of my enrolment, for me the pace of the teacher and the style of the lesson was perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that I was influenced by last year's reviews before the course started, but all my concerns were put to rest once the course actually started. <br />So if you still need a class now, I hope you won't regret taking this one!",
            "comment_grading": "The teacher also mentioned this, saying that the exam would be streamlined and the distribution of grades would be optimised in line with last year's situation.",
            "comment_workload": "As a year 4 exchange student, I would think that if you are interested in the subject, at least the first half of this course will not be a burden. I don't know how the sections on quantum algorithms and such will be as the professor hasn't uploaded the files yet, but as she has mentioned many times that she has gained a lot of experience from her first start, I think the workload for this course will at least be reasonable.",
