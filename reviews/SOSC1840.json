It examines how laws are used in the social, economic, and political activities of the Chinese people. The course focuses not on the Chinese laws per se but on how laws are used in people’s daily lives. Examples or cases will be used extensively in the course to illustrate the topics included. Major topics discussed in the course include the interactions between legal institutions and the party-state (i.e., the party and the government), the behavior of legal workers (e.g., judges, police officers), citizens’ use of civil lawsuits and administrative litigation, and some important mechanisms through which citizens or other social actors seek justice in China.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Learning outcomes<br /><br />After taking this introductory course, students are expected to: (1) know about Chinese legal institutions and their functions; (2): be familiar with the ways legal disputes are resolved in China; (3) understand the mechanisms that can be exploited by citizens or other social actors to seek justice in Chinese society; and (4) be able to analyze basic legal issues in China.<br /><br /> Lectures<br /><br />Week 1 Introduction: law and society in China<br /><br />Wang Shaoguang, “The Problems of State Weakness,” Journal of Democracy, vol. 14, no. 1 (2003), pp. 36-42.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“The Cultural Revolution”<br /><br />http://members.fortunecity.com/stalinmao/China/Cultural/Cultural.html<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Week 2 Introduction to legal institutions in China<br /><br />“China’s Judicial System: people’s courts, procuratorates, and public security,”<br />http://www.olemiss.edu/courses/pol324/chnjudic.htm<br /><br /> <br /><br />Richard Wong, “Why China chose the German instead of English legal system,”<br />South China Morning Post, October 13, 2015.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Week 3 Legal workers in China<br /><br />Peerenboom, China’s Long March toward Rule of Law, pp. 290-302.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Judging judges: To help build “the rule of law”, China is demoting judges,”<br />The Economists Sep 26th 2015<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Week 4 Citizens’ use of law in China (I)<br /><br />Yongshun Cai, “Social Conflicts and Modes of Action in China,” China Journal, vol. 59 (2008), pp. 62-82.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Zhang Shouzhi, “Litigation and enforcement in China: overview,” global.practicallaw.com/8-502-1965<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Week 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens’ use of law in China (II)<br /><br />Video: “The Story of Qiu Ju” (秋菊打官司) (English Subtitle).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Randall Peerenboom, China’s Long March toward Rule of Law, pp. 280-295.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Philip P.

There is not much interaction in class, as the professor is speaking most of the time, sometimes can be a bit monotonous but in general it is an interesting class. His stance towards the PRC government is relatively critical and some students may not like it.",

Each quiz covers the topic discussed the week before and requires a short written answer to a question. The first quiz is early around week 3 or 4 while the other two quizes are after the midterm. If a person studies regularly he/she will get 4 or 5 (5 is the max score) on the quizes. The exams are also easy unless a person does not make careless mistakes.",

Although there is 'law' in the course title, you don't need to actually know Chinese law. It's more about the culture and how law interacts with society. Generally, if don't extremely hate law, you'll be fine.",

The major law and party related issues are addressed, examples including the judiciary system, law enforcement, lawyers in China, petitions, the People's Congress etc. Some social phenomenon before and after the Cultural Revolution and Reform and opening-up policies are also covered, like medical dispute, house demolitation, rural reform etc. <br /><br />The overall content are not difficult to handle. The only thing good&nbsp;&nbsp;or bad at the same time is that the examples illustrated are quite long time ago, probably in the early 2000s, I would say it can be good to know the social changes in China in our childhood days, but the bad thing is the social conditions and international relation of China keeps changing in the past 10 years, it would be better to cover more such examples to demonstrate the concepts.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor has some Mainland accent but still not hard to follow his presentation. The lecture is sometimes boring given that he follows the lecture presentation to cover the key points and illustrates different cases during the class.

Some required readings are necessary for every exam.",

A subtle mistake may cost you 1 point loss for the entire course so just be careful. <br /><br />The exam are not cumulative and cover the content for the first&nbsp;&nbsp;and second half of the course with assigned readings respectively. Each exam includes 30 MCQs and 3 Short essay questions. <br /><br />My result:<br />Quiz x3<br />5/5, 5/5, 5/5<br />Midterm 40/42<br />Final 38/43<br /><br />Overall 93%<br />Grade A<br /><br />If you expect a good grade with low workload, this course is a good choice during online semester.

Some keywords may not be defined clearly in the MC questions, but it's hard for you to appeal when they are not giving you the correct answers.<br /><br />If you just want to look for a social science course to fulfill the common core requirement, this course will be a good option for you.
