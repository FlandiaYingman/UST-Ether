Can explain concepts clearly and convincingly, go to Terence the TA (harsh af grader) or raise hands and ask in class. She likes students that participate",
            "comment_grading": "Homeworks are easy, so make sure you get full marks / near full on all of them. Go over each question twice, cross-check with a friend. <br /><br />Midterm was really straightforward, i think at least a third of the class got nearly full marks. Again, heavily computation driven (i.e. they'll change the #s from the homework Qs and give them to you) - don't need to put thought into it, just grab your pen and hope you can finish on time. Cheat sheets allowed.<br /><br />Final is pretty much non cumulative, but heavy focus on EOQ model (both types) - I think over half the paper was on this topic. Make sure to thoroughly go over this module in your revision. Final is around half of your overall grade<br /><br />I managed to stay on course for an A up till the final, when I slipped to a B.",
            "comment_workload": "Light - to average, depending on how attentive you are in class. I checked out the textbook and read the chapters, and did the Qs just to make sure I understood the core concepts -&gt; doing this took a while, but the contents were just so dang interesting<br /><br />On average, an assignment every ~10 days to be submitted in class.",
