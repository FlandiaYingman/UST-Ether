The project can be delivered through the format of literature review, research, or practical study. A written report and an oral presentation are required to document their learning experiences. For CHEM students under the four-year degree only. Students should seek instructor's approval prior to enrollment in the course.",

No lab is required for this course, but required in CHEM 4691 (Capstone Research), which is an equivalent of this course.<br /><br />If you can't think of it, your supervisor (either Dennis Chan, Jason Chan or any other faculty professor they assign you) would give you some topics to choose from. <br /><br />Your research topic MUST be decided by mid-September (or mid-February if taken in Spring). You are expected to read at least THREE research articles &amp; make them a zip file in your submission of final report. <br /><br />You are required to deliver an oral presentation (late November or late April if taken in Spring) &amp; submit a formal report (due in mid-December or late May if taken in Spring) on what you have researched. Word limit is not present. Their % would be stated in the “GRADING” below.<br /><br />P.S. You MUST be well-prepared for the oral presentation as it counts the most &amp; the assessing professors would ask questions like a machine gun. Even if you just fail to answer one of the questions, you may already suffer significant mark-loss.",
