            "comment_content": "Summary of the course:<br />&quot;This course is part of HKUST's Common Core Program. This course develops and evaluates your skills in 5 Core Areas for Learning (CAfL): Three of these extend your learning from CORE1402: Written Language (WL), Spoken Language (SL) and Coherence (CO). Two more are further developed on this course: Synthesis (SY) and Multimodal Communication (MM).&quot;<br /><br />In other words, we have 2 written projects and 2 video projects, 1 of each are graded which makes up 75% of the grade. The other 25% comes from Self-Directed Learning tasks that takes up time in your week, waste of time honestly :/<br /><br />I also hate the fact that they still used the noisy ass timer.",
            "comment_teaching": "My instructor, Mark Hopkins, is a pretty friendly guy; he doesn't impose stupid rules or anything. Though we kinda have to participate in the class to know what's going on for the assignments.",
            "comment_grading": "Although I didn't give a lot of effort, for some reason I was given an A- here, I was expecting a B or B+ with the efforts I did. Perhaps ChatGPT did all the work for me 😌😌 Though grading may vary by instructor so again it's gacha to how your instructor treats you which kinda sucks",
            "comment_workload": "Every week you are expected to submit the assignment and then you might be called out in class to talk about your submission, which sucks for me. <br /><br />The projects are quite annoying too, they are placed near the midterm and finals, you would need to waste your time to make a video that is 4 minutes long near the finals so relying on chatgpt is always a good idea.<br /><br />I asked chatgpt to give a source for engaging in creative work stuff and it gave me this funny link <br />https://www.verywellmind.com/the-health-benefits-of-art-4163609",

W1 : 寫一篇350-450 summaries and critique 1 source，唔計分，會比comment，堂上會要求exchange<br />2. V1: group project in 3-4 people，將各自係W1用既source sub 落條片度，1:30-2:00長，一樣唔計分，會比comment，堂上會要求exchange<br />3. W2:寫一篇750-850 summaries and critique 2 sources，會計分，事後會show feedback &amp; comments，計分分3個aspects (written language+coherence+synthesis)<br />4. V2: solo project，不限source 數目，4-6 分鐘長，事後會show feedback &amp; comments，final submission 之後有Q&amp;A consultation，會計分並分4個aspects (spoken language + coherence + synthesis + multimodality)<br />**分數分level，最高exceptional, followed by exceptional/advanced, advenced, advanced/competent, competent, competent/emerging, emerging, entering (最低)**<br />**Rosie claim 攞 all competent C range **",
