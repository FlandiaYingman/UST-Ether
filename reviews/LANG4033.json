The literature review needs to cover other researchers' work and solutions in order to give further evidence of the niche in your FYP.<br /><br />‚úíÔ∏èA presentation describing the progress of FYP* <br />(4-5 minutes + 3 mins Q&amp;A)<br />Students give an overview, outline the methodology, and give an update on your current progress in FYP. <br /><br />*For non-final year CIVL students, alternative writing and speaking assessments will be given, which you are free to choose. You may review on a CIVL topic and give a presentation to outline the issue, describe the current trends, and evaluate existing technologies.",

Because I am a year 3 student, I did not have an FYP project. I proposed some review topics for the writing assessment to replace the FYP introduction and literature review. Unfortunately, the instructor thought my topic is too general and did not go in-depth. She advised me to come up with a hypothetical FYP topic so I can benefit from this course and gain the necessary techniques for writing the FYP report in the next year. Therefore, I did a lot of research and come up with a 'hypothetical' FYP Project title... <br /><br />For the second speaking assessment, I was permitted to work on the review of a CIVL topic, as I can't present the methodology and current progress of FYP.",

            "comment_content": "To grossly simplify, this is a trashy course. It is such a disgrace that I waste 3-credit on doing stupid stuffs in the final year. <br /><br />For the assessment part, please refer to the review of mhcm138. However, the content for this course simply does not meet the need of either for the construction industry or&nbsp;&nbsp;to help students to make progress on FYP. Therefore, it is worthless to mention the content again.<br /><br /> For workplace, or so-called professional communication of civil engineering, it is impossible not to use local languages because of the existence of Jargon/ communication with workers. For the academic part, the course is teaching you how to write a thesis, rather than a lab report. However, many FYP topics are experiments/simulations, with little supporting literature. In this sense this is non-sense to write a literature review that cannot contribute to the interim report.<br /><br /><br />Although this course is dumb, this is compulsory for all civil students. Therefore, prepare to waste more than 40 hours to complete a course in the semester that makes you feel yourself like a moron.",
            "comment_teaching": "This course is useless, but I do respect that the instructor make her every attempt to let the students learn as much as possible. <br />She provided detailed feedbacks and responded to the email promptly. <br /><br />The main problem is that the instructors just teach language skills, rather than telling you how your languages can make an effective technical communication.",
            "comment_grading": "Got about 75% and a B eventually. This is unsatisfactory since most CIVL4000 level course will have at least a B+ if you have average performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasted 40 hours on doing unpleasant coursework and got an unpleasant grade.<br /> <br />The most frustrating part is that the coursework is graded by laymen. They grade the work by your &quot;language skills&quot;, rather than the quality of the findings. If they cannot understand your topic, then you are going to have a miserable life.",

            "comment_content": "As mentioned by other students, the course content is generally divided into two parts: (1) A feasibility study for the redevelopment of San Po Kong &amp; (2) Introduction &amp; Literature Review of Final Year Project. <br /><br />In some sense I agree that some of the content covered in this language course do not help much for polishing a nice capstone design project report/FYP report or improving your spoken English, but I still appreciated the efforts made by Anita in delivering the course content in a cohesive and well-structured manner. <br /><br />The feasibility study requires both individual and groupwork. It covers an individual feasibility report (around 1000-1200 words) for the redevelopment of San Po Kong by identifying the existing problems (such as environmental issue/traffic etc.), followed by providing solutions with the application of innovative civil engineering technologies, discussing the feasibility of your solutions and providing recommendations. <br />An in-class group (around 3-4 persons) presentation for around 15-20 mins then follows.<br /><br />You will later need to submit a FYP Introduction and Literature Review with around 800-1200 words by covering the research topic, niche, research gap, project objectives and comparing the existing research works provided in the literature. A 5-min individual presentation will require you to further elaborate the proposed project methodology together with your progress of work. A 2-min Q&amp;A session will follow.",
            "comment_teaching": "Anita is a really nice language tutor. She is well-prepared for every class with clear teaching objectives. Basically she went through the content from the textbook and provided different writing and speaking tips for your assignments. She provided sufficient time for students to read through the assigned readings and discussion topics during classes, and provided rooms for students to share their views on their own. In later part of the course, she tended to be more lenient during classes by covering more writing techniques for the FYP report. <br /><br />Sometimes classes ended earlier than expected and she provided adequate consultation and contributive feedback for your assignments. <br /> <br />An online consultation session was assigned before the commencement of the first speaking assignment. She provided tips for students to modify their presentation slides. <br /><br />I recommend students to take her class if you want your efforts to be recognized.",
            "comment_grading": "I would say the grading is lenient. Most CIVL students should have only received B-Range in previous LANG courses. <br /><br />If you follow the instructions and writing skills as taught during classes, give some time to polish your writing and prepare your presentation, the grade should be very reasonable. <br /><br />You know la, civil students always expect &quot;no pain, but gain&quot; ah. That's why people always complain &quot;laan&quot; grade. The only &quot;laan&quot; grade course I have to admit should be CIVL2510 lor.<br /><br />My grade:<br />Feasibility Report: 26/28 (20%)<br />Feasibility Presentation:17.5/21 (20%)<br />FYP Report: 26/28 (25%)<br />FYP Presentation: 18/21 (25%)<br />Out of class activities: full (10%)<br /><br />Grade: A<br />I don't think there are students receiving an A+... <br />But I still appreciate the course grade is just nice for everyone.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload depends much on your effort and your course schedule. <br /><br />The two writing assignments may only cost you a few days to complete so. If you have ideas what you really want to write, then the reports should not be too difficult. <br /><br />The presentations may take you more time since you are required to prepare the presentation slides and rehearse quite a number of times by reciting the scripts with your groupmates. The workload depends on your expectation. If you want a nice grade, start rehearsing weeks before the real presentation and remember to finalize and submit the presentation slides on time. Or else your groupmate will be very sad.<br /><br />The second assignment may take you more time as more activities are expected during the end of the semester.",

            "comment_content": "As is the case for other mainstream LANG courses, this course is split into two parts. Each part has a writing assignment and a speaking assignment. The content of the textbook (available on Canvas) revolves around these assignments. Attendance is taken every class even though there is no participation mark for this course: according to CLE, an attendance rate of at least 80% is required to pass the course.<br /><br />The first part focuses on professional communication and is based on an outdated scenario regarding the redevelopment of San Po Kong. We were to write an individual report with 1000-1200 words, and later conduct a group presentation 12-15 minutes long, to propose an innovative technology that can be applied to this scenario. It reminds me of the engineering innovation part of LANG 2030(H), except that we now have to write a feasibility report instead of a proposal report. Is this useful? Let's just say that I did not use any of this when working on the reports in the capstone project (CIVL 4950).<br /><br />The second part focuses on academic communication and is all about the Final Year Project (FYP). There are alternative arrangements for Year 3 students who enroll in this course; however, since everyone in my class is in Year 4, I will not elaborate further on that. We were to write the introduction and literature sections of our FYP report in 800-1200 words, then deliver a presentation lasting 4-5 minutes to share our FYP and current progress. You can use the content that you have written here for the real deal (CIVL 4910). I find this particularly helpful this year considering that by the end of December, we have to hand in not only the first half of the FYP report but also a progress report, so this assignment can reduce your workload later on. One major caveat, however: if your supervisor has barely formed the scope of the FYP by this stage, you may end up wasting time if it eventually does not fit your work.<br /><br />There are also two out-of-class tasks that count directly towards the final grade, with one task to be done in each part of the course. The tasks are evaluated based on effort rather than language competency. These tasks are pretty light and can be easily done within an hour each.",
            "comment_teaching": "Sandy is new to HKUST (this is her first year here), so she appears friendly and actively interacted with the class to better understand the culture here. (Note: this does not mean she spent considerable time just chatting with us. I am referring to the interaction during teaching.) Perhaps due to this, she frequently failed to cover all of the planned content within a class and had to either delay or cut some of the topics. She assigned short non-graded tasks for us to complete between classes and set up a Google Sheet to summarize them; however, she appears to have forgotten to update the Google Sheet from October onwards. For each assignment, she prepared a PowerPoint to explain the requirements which I often find myself referring to during my work.<br /><br />Outside of class, she was more than willing to answer our questions right after class. Around a week before the submission of each assignment, she also arranged sessions in Language Commons for walk-in support. Email requests were responded to within a day.<br /><br />Feedback was released quite late (almost a month after the submission of the written assignments), but it may be a delay in the course-wide grading process rather than an issue with the instructor.",

In my opinion, the grading is pretty bad, considering that I received A+ with 85% overall score in the previous LANG courses.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload can vary greatly based on effort and proficiency. I spent around 3 full-time days working on each writing assignment, 1 full-time day on each presentation, and around 30 minutes on each out-of-class task.<br /><br />Do note the presentation period for Speaking Assignment 1 overlaps with the midterm examination period, so you should plan with your group in advance.<br /><br />For a 3-credit course, I consider the workload relatively light, provided that the work in the second half of the course can be transferred to the real FYP. Otherwise, I would consider it to be just average.",
