It is very standard for an introductory course on thermal physics, and I especially like this balanced treatment between classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.<br /><br />The textbook (Schroeder) is a good one. It is in general very understandable and &quot;reader-friendly&quot;. The author's writing style make the book kind of like a &quot;Griffiths&quot; in thermodynamics. If you have the time, I highly suggest you to read through the textbook.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, Schroeder did not do a very good job on quantum statistics (ch.7) like the rest of the book and make the subject mysteriously difficult to understand from his explanation. Therefore, I would suggest you to obtain a secondary text for the quantum statistics part. I personally uses Stowe's &quot;Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics&quot;, which is readily available from the library and is on about the same level &amp; scope as Schroeder (so it can also be used as a supplement to other topics).",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Cheung is a standard one. He mostly just read aloud the PowerPoint in class, and sometime do some explanation on the whiteboard (especially for the stat mech part).<br /><br />I can tell he has a good altitude toward teaching. But unfortunately, due to his limited English proficiency and teaching skills, I really can't say his teaching is good at all. But at least he did try his best to be helpful, for example, he often upload a lot of supplementary material on Canvas and give hints to the homework problems, and he replies email inquiry at an extremely fast rate.<br /><br />For the course material, although I always think teaching physics with PowerPoint is simply ridiculous, the PowerPoint slides used by this course are so far the only one I found to be acceptable for a physics course. They explain things quite clearly and often offer alternative derivation to some of the major result in the textbook. The exams are based more on the content of the PowerPoint, so I suggest you to read through them to get used to&nbsp;&nbsp;the alternative methods and notations, when studying for the exam.<br /><br />The TA will work through several problems (and go through the homework) during the tutorial session.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework Assignments\t25.0%<br />Mid-Term Exam\t35.0%<br />Final Examination\t40.0%<br /><br />There is also a PRS bonus, which can be obtained from answering PRS questions during the lecture throughout the whole semester (there are not many of them though). The bonus can count for a maximum of 2%. The bonus won't normally included in your overall score, but if your score happened to be near the cut-off of a sub-grade, then the bonus points will be used to raise your final grade by one sub-grade.<br /><br />I think the grading is fair enough, and it provides you quite some chance to get a good grade by including this PRS bonus system and having a 25% homework component.<br /><br />I am not too sure about the grade distribution, but here are some statistics of the exams:<br /><br />Midterm: mean 72.3 SD 1x (I don't remember)<br />Final: mean 44.4 SD 2x<br /><br />The professor tended to make the midterm too easy, and there will be quite a lot of people scored nearly full-marks. To make up for that, the final was much more difficult.",
            "comment_workload": "There is one homework assignment every week, which contains about 1-2 textbook problems. They can be very easily solved within 15 minutes, if you understand the material. But they can be quite stressful if you are behind in class, especially after the midterm period when you are way too busy to study at all.<br /><br />For the exams, it is very important to get a clear conceptual understanding of every topic. The exams won't ask you to do some very sophisticated calculation, but rather, they often ask you to re-derive something that is in the text. (The final essentially ask you to reproduce all the major results in Ch.7) So it is a good idea to go through all the derivation in the textbook yourself.<br /><br />Also, Dr. Cheung will post a selected set of problems from the textbook for each chapter on canvas, they are also very helpful for studying for the exams.",

Both excellent textbooks with useful exercises and solutions online.<br /><br />As you can see, final is more chur than midterm.<br /><br />I am a LIFS student, and I took this course alongside PHYS2022, so it is easy to see that the prerequisite is quite unnecessary.<br /><br />It is recommended that at the very least you have studied MATH2011/2023 Multivariable Calculus, and remember some concepts like integration by parts and Taylor series from MATH1014. These things will appear all the time.<br /><br />Revisiting the thermodynamics from PHYS1112 is optional, because you would be proving everything anyways.<br /><br />There will be some strange integrals, but don't worry, the solutions would be given (or maybe you would be able to solve it by yourself if you still remember what you learnt in MATH2023).<br /><br />I think the content is interesting, and the textbook made it seem even more interesting. The mathematics involved is suffering, but as long as you do all the exercises in the textbook that are related to math, you should be able to understand.",

The midterm past papers are useful and doable. Solutions can be found if you look hard enough. I couldn't find any solutions for final past papers, and they are hard as fuck. However, this year the final is a bit easier (yay).<br /><br />If you really want to secure an A, then select some relevant exercises from the suggested textbook as well (Concepts in Thermal).

He also tries to interact with us by asking us simple questions and giving classwork with discussions with each other. His notes are easy to understand: like main points are highlighted and details with examples are given for some key concept. Overall his teaching is quite good.

The final exam is somewhat harder than the midterm and the mean is around 65/100 so in the long run quite a number of us get a A grade. Those with below mean results obtain a C range.

So, be sure to know how to derive the relations and understand them well.
