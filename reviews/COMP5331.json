But since we had almost entire freedom in the project (do research/implementation/survey on any Database/Data Mining/Machine Learning/Information Retrieval paper), doing the project is not intimidating. According to the professor himself, the workload of the project totally depends on the students themselves, so its quite 'elastic'.",
