            "comment_content": "This course mainly focuses on optimisation, problem solving and decision making. Rather than focusing specific theories or frameworks (like you would encounter in most of the other courses), the professor introduces various problems each class, and the class time is spent in thinking about how to solve these problems logically, and then using Excel (and related Excel functions like Solver) to solve these problems. <br /><br />For people who like studying out a textbook with a clear syllabus and topic list, I think this course will be quite interesting (and challenging) in the beginning, since there are no lecture notes provided, per say. <br /><br />The content itself is very interesting, and you get to learn a lot about different Excel features and functions (I certainly learnt a lot of useful functions). A lot of the things you learn can be applied in various other courses, like workforce scheduling, production optimisation, logistics, etc. <br /><br />As a required course for the OM major, I would definitely say that the course is quite fascinating, practical and useful.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Zhang is a very friendly and helpful professor, and he's very willing to answer any questions you may have (through email or face-to-face). Initially, you might find the style of teaching a bit different, as you spend the entire lesson going through 4-5 Excel files and solving various problems. If you can get used to this style of learning, then I find that you will definitely be able to appreciate Prof. Zhang's teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is relatively fair. <br /><br />The final grade is made up of two major components<br />— Quizzes (3 quizzes, 15% each)<br />— Final Exam (55%)<br /><br />The quizzes are held in-class and contain relatively short problems (it's hard to predict what the problems will be). <br /><br />The final exam is much tougher and requires much more thinking, and it can cover anything taught in the course. <br /><br />You can skip all of the quizzes and shift the entire weighting of the course to the final exam, the professor is very flexible with this.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload really depends on the grade you want. There are no homework assignments or projects due. The professor does upload 3 exercises (for the whole semester), but these are optional - although it's a good idea to complete these exercises since they are a good way to practice your skills.",

I don't know whether he will do the same in offline lecture. I recommend to review his recording since sometimes he goes through stuff a bit too fast.

A significant proportion of the course (Chapters 3 - 7) focuses on optimization modeling with Solver. The problem-solving approach of this course is really great. It allows us to learn not just the Excel features, but also the way to model and solve various business problems.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />1️⃣ Introduction to Management Science<br />2️⃣ Introduction to Spreadsheet Modeling<br />3️⃣ Introduction to Optimization Modeling<br />4️⃣ Linear Programming Models<br />5️⃣ Network Models<br />6️⃣ Optimization Models with Integer Variables<br />7️⃣ Nonlinear Optimization Models",

But this is reasonable considering that it's a 4-credit course. <br /><br />Both the quiz and the final are computer-based exams similar to the exercises done in class in terms of format. The quiz covers chapters 2 to 3, while the final covers chapters 3 to 7. Open books, open notes, and we're provided with the PowerPoint slides. Make sure you prepare well for the final as it's more difficult, and it takes a huge chunk of your grade.

The female TA, Ms. Xinli Xie, spoke so softly and with terrible english that I wanted to kill myself in every tutorial I went. Honestly, she should have been removed because she was of no help. Even the male TA, Mr. Haoyu Liu, spoke in a monotonous tone which made it very hard to understand. The TA's should have been fired because they sucked.",
