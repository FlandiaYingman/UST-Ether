So, I skipped the remaining lectures.<br /><br />Instead of attending the lectures, I learned the course content on Coursera, this platform provided nearly the same learning materials with explicit explanation videos on each topic (much better than lectures!!!!). On top of that, the learning videos and materials on Coursera are also provided by Chasnov. So, you don't have to worry about the discrepancy between the lecture content and the content on Coursera. Some of the content on Coursera is not covered by this course and you can refer to the course outline to study the relevant topics.<br /><br />The tutorials provided some exercises on different topics, these exercises are highly similar to the mid-term and final exam.

Keep in mind that you will miss out on the proper explanations if you don't listen to him. He also has a Coursera course and YouTube videos in case you missed the lectures. The IRL lectures though are a little boring. Sometimes, he cracks a few jokes but they're usually hit and miss.<br /><br />He tells you what each of the problems are before the exam so you have a better idea of what you should revise. There are also worksheets in the tutorials that gives you more opportunity to revise. The questions themselves are pretty well made and can warm you up to the exams. The one about Applications of First Order Linear Odes is hell though. Don't try to do that one.<br /><br />In each tutorial, you listen to the tutor explain in detail what you've learned and do a few selected questions on the worksheet.

            "comment_content": "This course is divided into 2 individual parts, <br />1st: Linear Algebra (before midterm, 8 questions for Midterm, equal weighting for each question) <br />2nd: Differential Equations (DE) (after midterm, 8 questions for Final ONLY, equal weighting for each question). <br /><br />For the whole course, it is mostly step-memorising. You have a standard procedure for either Linear Algebra or DE Calculation! However, there are some physics for DE parts, e.g. RLC Circuit (**Non-dimensionalize), Pendulum, Mass spring system/Normal mode, escape velocity (This year exam questions from tutorial 9: applications of ODEs), terminal velocity; and some other applications: compound interest, chemical reactions, logistic equation, and so on.<br /><br />**it is the most difficult topics that I personal think!<br /><br />I stay at home to watch the lecture video except the first lecture. I do agree you attend the first lecture to know more about the professor. Then, just sit at home and watch the lecture video in 1.5-2 times speed (usually post after 1 day afternoon).<br /><br />For both exams, no calculator &amp; closed books; There are 13 tutorial worksheets, and each of them counts (0-2 marks): most people got full marks! (Some weeks will be extremely hard: application of ODEs (Tutorial 9))<br /><br />My personal suggestion: as there is no calculator allowed in exam, some of the worksheets which may require the use of calculator SHOULD NOT be in exam. Be smart and choose the possible questions to practice!! <br /><br />P.S. This course is mostly CIVL, CBE, MECH students!",
            "comment_teaching": "The reasons I mentioned that you watch the lecture videos:<br />1. Professor seldom answers students’ questions in lecture (Not many students have questions)<br />2. Professor speaks in an extremely slow pace, that 2x speed may be your best choice.<br />3. The content the professor teaches refers mostly to his book, which can be downloaded from his MATH2350 website. You can sit at home and read it/or print it (probably $33, depending on the edition, since he updates his notes quick often (NOT within the semester, but weeks before the semester))/or buy it ($40) later!<br /><br />The best parts for students: professor gives most of the hints (topics and reminders) for both midterm and final. <br /><br />Besides, one of the two TAs, Justin (Sun Jia Ze), he can speak cantonese, and he teaches very well. He allows us to send a softcopy through email to him OR put the hardcopy outside the TA office (Lift 21 Rm3213, I am not sure whether it will change in later years). He always responds to my email (he is responsible and helps us to get good grade, by answering questions in a well manner!)<br /><br />The TA makes his own notes which I think it is extremely useful, and you will know why. Please trust me! Moreover, he is good at communicating as his Cantonese, Mandarin/Putonghua, English are all good!!!<br /><br />THE BEST TAs I have seen in this semester!!!!!",
            "comment_grading": "My Score: <br />65/80 in midterm (40%) (Mean~51, SD~17)<br />73/80 in final (50%) (Mean~46, SD~16)<br />26/26 for 13 Tutorial worksheets (10%) (2 marks full marks each!)<br />Grade: A+, MY 1st A+ in HKUST :)<br /><br />Fair grading. Two schemes for your grade: absolute grading and normal distribution. One of the schemes counts the best grade and that will be your final grade.<br /><br />Both midterm and final was really fair in difficulty, in addition of his tips for the topics that he examined. JUST BE CAREFUL!!!!! This year's exam is more difficult than last year, according to the professor. Hence, professor set the fail marginal line as total 30 mark instead of 50, due to the poor performance this year.",
            "comment_workload": "For 10% mark (Tutorial), depending on your TAs, and whether they allow you to skip the tutorial, and hand in the softcopy of the worksheets before the tutorial.<br />The risk depends on everyone, whether you think the tutorial is useful. I suggest you attend at least two tutorials for the whole semester.<br /><br />For 40% mark (Midterm) &amp; 50% mark (Final), they really depend on you, being careful &amp; smart? Most of the questions should be practice-based, i.e. you should have already done most of the similar questions. Professor only changes the form a little, and something you cannot find online, e.g. normal mode (2 springs, 3 masses)<br /><br />If you do all the exercise once/twice in detail and understand most of the concepts, and be careful in exam, you can probably get A range!

He seemed to be more passionate about ODEs than matrix. <br /><br />The midterm questions were really similar to the practice exercise he gave.

Complex Numbers <br /><br />2. Matrices <br />(Definitions and Properties of matrices) <br /><br />3. System of Linear Equations <br />(Gaussian Elimination, Reduced row echelon form, computing inverses, LU decomposition)<br /><br />4. Vector Spaces <br />(Linear independence, span, basis, dimension, inner product spaces, null space, row space, column space, left null space, rank, gram-schmidt process, orthogonal projections, least-square problem)<br /><br />5. Determinants <br />(Laplace expansion, Leibniz Formula, and properties)<br /><br />6. Eigenvalues &amp; Eigenvectors <br />(matrix diagonalization)<br /><br />The midterm stress much on vector spaces and eigenvalues &amp; eigenvectors with matrix diagonalization. <br /><br />B. ODE <br />1. First Order ODE <br />(separable and linear equations, applications)<br /><br />2. Second order ODE <br />(principle of superposition, Wronskian, homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations, resonance, applications with non-dimensionalization)<br /><br />3. Series solutions of homogeneous linear second order equations (Ordinary points) <br /><br />4. Systems of linear differential equations <br />(Normal Modes applications and phase space diagrams) <br /><br /><br />You can just understand the content covered in the lecture notes which can be downloaded from prof's homepage. Textbook is not necessary. The course is mainly designed for engineering students with few stress on rigorous mathematical proofs and deductions, so if you can deal with the computations, no big deal.<br /><br />In this semester, most students are from CIVL and only some from MECH or other major. So, it turns out to be a Civil Engineering course.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor simply follows the lecture notes and use the examples covered. You can watch his Youtube/ Coursera videos if you want to learn in a faster pace or review the lecture content. The professor would also provide some additional explanations for some harder concepts and computations. Overall speaking, Prof Chasnov did a good job in delivering the content and I would say he is an easy-going and responsible person. <br /><br />The tutorial is simply reviewing the lecture content with extra demonstrations of different applications, then students will have time to work on the tutorial problems. You can just work the problems prior to the tutorials if you download the worksheets and submit to the TA directly, this definitely save your time. Yunfei can help answer student's questions in tutorials.<br /><br />Solutions will be provided on the tutorial homepage. Just work on it seriously as the exams are based on the tutorial work.",

The questions are just similar to those in past paper this semester. Just drill the past paper and done given that you paid sufficient efforts understanding the content. The professor seems to be very lenient this semester. So good! <br /><br />Statistics: <br />Tutorial Worksheets Full mark<br />Midterm 77/80<br />Final 40/40<br />overall: 98.5%<br /><br />Grade: A+, btw over 50 students receive A+ lol, the prof is crazily mad! <br /><br />Two grading systems are provided, the absolute and relative one. Due to the very easy exams, scoring extremely high marks can guarantee you getting A-range without difficulty. <br /><br />If you score almost full mark (say &gt;97%), you will simply get an A+ under the absolute grading scheme.",
            "comment_workload": "Overall speaking, it is not a very hard course, but I would say you should spend extra time on Vector Spaces, matrix diagonalization for the first part. And spend time solving the equations with different ansatz and the application problems in the second part. These are the harder topics in exams. <br /><br />Weekly workload is just the tutorial worksheets, just need to pay some efforts and getting full marks is an easy task if you submit on time. After-lecture practices can be done using the worksheet given in the tutorials and the Coursera exercises which I personally suggest you to do so since some problems may appear identically in the exams. The Coursera problems can be obtained from the Notes, <br />i.e. Matrix Algebra / Differential Equations for Engineers",

            "comment_content": "The 1st part of the course was about linear algebra, including matrices, and some special techniques like Gram-Schmidt Process. In my opinion, you had better understand the principle thoroughly such that you do not need to remember the ways of computation, or so-called formulae, given that you have some basic knowledge of matrix computations (M2).<br /><br />The 2nd part of the course was about differential equation. Only linear differential equations were taught in this course. This part may requires much memorization of techniques for computing, and there were different conditions corresponding to different computation &quot;tricks&quot;, like finding the general solutions for linear inhomogeneous equations.<br /><br />The midterm paper and final paper just contained the 1st and 2nd part RESPECTIVELY, ie no questions about the 1st part were in the final exam. Questions in exams were promised to be similar to the tutorial worksheets. In addition, n the final exam, there was an ODE application question (about terminal velocity). This application question was&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen from the tutorial worksheet about the ODE application as guaranteed. Some may think that as calculators are not allowed n exam, we can just skip those questions requiring calculators in the worksheets. Yet, I observed that the professor would modify the question such that those requiring calculators initially contained no numerical calculations in the end, ie numbers were replaced by variables. For this question, I would say setting the equation is the most and the only difficult part.<br /><br />Also, there was 2 questions not included n the tutorial worksheets: non-dimensionalizing an ODE and a spring-mass system equation (guaranteed to be with 2-4 identical blocks and 0-2 walls at the left and right ends and identical springs between blocks and between a block and a wall).",

Prof CHASNOV pointed out in class as he taught us with reference to this notes. This book can help you catch up the learning progress if you do not understand something in class, despite having many words.<br /><br />Some may find his speaking is too slow, but for me, it is suitable, as you often need some time to digest the content. <br /><br />He was patient enough to explain what was taught in class if you asked him after class. However, sometimes he may not be able to understand how you think of or view one thing, even when your way of understanding was correct yet different from the professor's.",

They are not so difficult if you remember some basic formulas.",
            "comment_teaching": "Chasnov has an interesting accent but he explains well on the topics. Though I started skipping lessons after midterm, I did just fine on the final exam. He also gave us tips on midterm and final exam. A practice was given before the midterm and the midterm had roughly the same style as the practice. Eventually I got full mark on midterm. I love Xu Wei as my tutor as he teaches great and speaks Cantonese. (and handsome as well)",

            "comment_workload": "As said by students taking this course in the previous semesters,&nbsp;&nbsp;the course was a disaster and it included lots of materials and required a large number of memorizations. But now, the professor listened to the students' opinions and decided to change. The workload is extremely small. I just needed to attend the tutorial to finish some questions and took the assignment mark every week. The tutor will talk about them and the questions are not very difficult.",
