        "name": "History of Pre-Modern Chinese Technology and Its Transfer Overseas",
        "description": "This course elucidates the role of technology in Chinese history, as well as the social and economic mechanisms that supported its supremacy in East Asia and Southeast Asia through analysis of different production technologies. The knowledge is presented in a framework that puts Chinese technology in comparative perspective, differentiates technology from science, and examines concepts of technology peculiar to China. The course takes an analytical approach by focusing on the transfer of specific technologies, and explores what these patterns of transfers teach us about the relationship between technology and society in pre-modern East and Southeast Asia. Viewing Chinese history from the perspective of technological transfer highlights the fundamental relationship between technology and the economy, and allows us to compare China with early modern Europe. Such comparisons guide us away from Eurocentric biases and aid students to formulate balanced views of Chinese Technology.",
