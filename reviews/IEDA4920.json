        "description": "This is a one-year course undertaken by students in their final year. The course will require students to engage in a company sponsored project that provides practical experience to the students on topics they have learnt in their major courses. The project requires regular involvement by a specific professional in the sponsoring company, and will be supervised by a faculty in the department. Depending on the complexity of the project and the capacity of the sponsoring company, the project may be undertaken by either a single student, or a group with a maximum of four students. For projects with multiple members in a group, the role and deliverables of each student must be clearly laid out at the outset. For DA students in their fourth year of study only. May be graded PP.",
