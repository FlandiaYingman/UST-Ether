Students will explore and experience their surroundings in unfamiliar ways, and discover new understanding of their living environment and new ways of artistic creation. Students will gain an understanding of the streams of development and the creative concepts of installation art, as well as its influences to both visual arts and the society. Students will also learn to explore space, materials, forms, contents and techniques in installation art. Upon the completion of the course, students will experience making use of spatial design as a means of communication and expression. Those interested in furthering the artistic skills and gaining hands-on experience with this art form may enroll in a separate non-credit co-curricular course.",
