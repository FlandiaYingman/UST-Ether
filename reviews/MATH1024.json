            "comment_teaching": "----------------------------- 𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐔𝐑𝐄𝐒 -----------------------------<br /><br />The teaching is very concise and clear, but the speed is very fast. His English accent is good enough for us to follow, and he knows Cantonese as well. You are free to ask him questions after the lecture. There is usually a 5 min break in the middle of a lecture, so your brain can take a rest.<br /><br />The handwriting is done on GoodNotes with screen recording. If you cannot follow the pace, you can review the lecture by watching the video.<br /><br />The course content follows mainly Yan Min's notes, but occasionally there will be extra content with supplementary notes. Besides, there will be 1 worksheet per 1-2 lessons that demonstrates some approaches to easier problems.<br /><br />---------------------------- 𝐓𝐔𝐓𝐎𝐑𝐈𝐀𝐋𝐒 ----------------------------<br /><br />There is 1 tutorial per week. Some problems are a bit easy, while others are very difficult with long solutions that won't appear in homework or exams. However, I think more explanation can be done on how the solutions are achieved, instead of leaving us the impression that only experienced math students can come up with the solutions. Besides, more effort can be put into selecting the tutorial problems. Sometimes the T.A. just completes one tutorial with easy problems within 15 minutes.<br /><br />------------------- 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐑𝐄𝐕𝐈𝐄𝐖 𝐒𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 -------------------<br /><br />Before the final exam, there will be a final review session revisiting the concepts, demonstrating some problems, and going through the cheat sheet.",
            "comment_grading": "------------------------------ 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆 ------------------------------<br /><br />Take the maximum mark such that the total is 100%:<br /><br />Homework 20%<br />Midterm 10%-40%<br />Final 40%-70%<br /><br />This means you can save your midterm with your final, but not vice versa. Therefore, make sure you put enough effort into preparing for the final exam.<br /><br />The grade is decent. A range is given to people with 55% total marks or above, and half of the class is in the A range. You secure a B+ if you are above the mean.<br /><br />Mean = 47.77, S.D. = 21.25<br /><br />A+: 75<br />A: 60<br />A-: 55<br />B+: 50<br />B: 40<br />B-: 35<br />C+: 30<br />C: 25<br />C-: 20<br /><br />-------------------------- 𝐁𝐎𝐍𝐔𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐒 --------------------------<br /><br />The homework offers a bonus course point of 0.2 by submitting a LaTeX-generated .pdf file and the original .tex file instead of handwriting. Therefore, you can get a total of 2 total course marks (without the *20% for homework). I think it is worth the time to type LaTeX, as the 2 course marks may be saving you for a higher grade.<br /><br />You can also earn a bonus course point of 0.2 by finding and reporting a typo in Yan Min's lecture notes, homework, or homework solutions, capped at 2 points. Yan Min's notes contain a decent amount of typos, especially in computation steps, but hard to find in my opinion since the notes are quite long. In contrast, I think typos are easier to be found in Ivan's homework solutions. Some easy ones are missing a &quot;dx&quot;, missing the integrand, and missing the term to sum over after the summation symbol.<br /><br />There were also 2 more bonus marks from:<br />1. Treasure hunt - Find the secret word from the symbols from each worksheet.<br />2. Fourier picture gallery - Upload a figure drawn with the Fourier series with varying no. of sin and cosine terms, where the figures are generated with coding, and the Fourier expansion is derived from HW #10 optional problem.<br /><br />With the highest possible bonus course points of 6, you can get one subgrade higher, so they are worth the time completely.<br /><br />------------------------------- 𝐄𝐗𝐀𝐌𝐒 -------------------------------<br /><br />The midterm and final exams are extremely difficult, you will feel like vomiting blood during the exams. The midterm exam kicks off with a very tricky question (What is the meaning of some weird notation?). The final exam offers 1 bonus mark to the 3 closest answers for &quot;At what age did Euler solve the Basel problem?&quot;. Then, there are a few short questions, which are already quite difficult for normal people like me.<br /><br />Then, they are followed by 2-3 computation questions which are where most people get points from. Each is worth around 10 points. For your reference, midterm has definite integrals that require you to apply a few substitutions or integration by part, while final has series computations that require you to apply Abel's Limit Theorem, Fourier series, or given power series of some function.<br /><br />Afterward, there are 2 long problems with around 4 parts each. These are the most difficult questions that I usually don't know how to do. But by writing something, regardless of correctness, the lenient T.A.s may give at least 1 mark. You can write down the approach to a problem if you failed to work out the exact details, and you will usually get more than half of the marks.<br /><br />------------------------ 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐃𝐄 𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐄 ------------------------<br /><br />Finally, the final exam result and letter grades are quickly released within 24 hours after the final exam, so don't check your result if you think it may affect your performance in other final exams.",
            "comment_workload": "--------------------------- 𝐇𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐊 ---------------------------<br /><br />As a student who got 5** in DSE Math Core and 5* in M2, the workload was like an 8-credit course. But given this is an honor course, I would give the workload a D.<br /><br />There were a total of 10 homework. Each homework would be released each week, containing 4 compulsory long problems and 1 optional problem with 2-4 parts each. But the deadline was usually 3 weeks later, meaning there were 2 weeks of buffer in case you cannot finish it within the first week.<br /><br />The homework problems require a lot of thinking. Therefore, it's better to form groups to work on the homework, as lots of times, you wouldn't be able to come up with a solution. Usually, the solution only takes not more than 5 steps, so if your unsuccessful attempt is overly complicated, you may be in the wrong direction. It took me around 2-3 days to complete one homework.<br /><br />However, the homework was very rewarding, not only because they were intellectually stimulating, but compared to MATH 1014 difficulty, you can have a good grasp of the concepts and computations in the topic, but it was completely not enough for handling Ivan's exams.<br /><br />-------------------------- 𝐁𝐎𝐍𝐔𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐒 --------------------------<br /><br />The homework offers a bonus course point of 0.2 by submitting a LaTeX-generated .pdf file and the original .tex file instead of handwriting. This also takes a lot of time, usually within 1 day. I recommend using the online platform Overleaf - https://overleaf.com for its good editor (e.g. highlight brackets, the drop-down list for commands) and auto-save function. If your eyesight is not that good, you can use Mathcha - https://mathcha.io as it is a live LaTeX editor, i.e. you can directly edit the preview of math expressions with LaTeX instead of typing LaTeX code and then compiling it for preview.<br /><br />If you are a perfectionist, do not fixate on the beauty of LaTeX, make sure you put enough effort into other courses and balance time well while you take this beast.",

These notes will give you some ideas to deal with his HW!<br /><br />At last, let me quote a MATH1023 Workload Review by Sofy Twilight:<br />&quot;I am not a fucking genius, I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder because of thinking those motherfucker mathematics questions and concepts days and nights helplessly, and guess what, none of them emerged in the fucking examination.

We need to do some basic question very fluently, otherwise one may not have enough time to do in the exam. There are many exercises in the Yan Min's book (which will be provide by the instructor through Canvas so one no need to find exercise from somewhere else). These exercises will not be graded and you don't need to let anyone know you have done the exercises. Just for your own practice.<br /><br />About homeworks:<br />The whole class are divided into many small groups and each groups consists of 3-4 students. Each group has to write one solution for each homework so group member have to collaborate together. Each homework consists of 6 long questions. Dr. Xiong mentioned that there are 1 homework each week at the very beginning of the semester, but I don't know why he stopped at the third week and there are only a total of 5 homework in the whole semester. LaTeX typing is not required in this semester (but may or may not require in other semester, I don't know) but strongly encourage to use LaTeX to type the homework solution. Using LaTex will have 10% extra mark in the homework and no penalty for not using it.",

            "comment_content": "@@ No Fourier Series covered this semester. I guess because there wasn't enough time. But unlike previous years, we had a detailed coverage on the practical side of calculus, that Prof. Hu talked a lot on parametric curves and polar coordinates. Though sketching polar curves wasn't tested, I've become very proficient at drawing basic polar curves now. Polar curves are pretty~<br /><br />I think overall we have a more in-depth discussion on every topic. If not, at least your fear for failing the exam would propel you to study hard, and thus gain better insights on the covered topics than normal 1013 people. It's overall a rewarding experience, you gain more as you study more.<br /><br />If you come from 1013, you might have a bit of problem with Series.",

            "comment_workload": "The workload is light throughout the semester. We only got one written assignment based on selected problems from the textbook. Those problems aren't very difficult. If you get stuck, just find the helpful TA and you'll get the problems done.<br /><br />However, if you wanna get a good grade, better study hard for the mid-term and final. I would suggest you to go through his past papers a few times, in order to get used to his answering style. Brevity and cautiousness are the keys. Also revise all types of problems that you've encountered on the textbook, except the ones that are too application-oriented, as they are very likely won't be tested. Above all, prepare yourself well for handling tedious calculations in the exams. Good luck~",

            "comment_content": "Mainly about integration and series, please refer to other reviews if you want more details. The most important parts are approximations of integrals, improper integrals, convergence of series and Fourier series.<br />For those who are wondering whether you should take math 1024, here are some suggestions (assume you aim for A range).<br />Those who have taken 1023: Just continue if you have A range in 1023, otherwise, do not expect you would suddenly improve.<br />Those who have not taken 1023: Take the course if and only if you meet these criteria:<br />1. You can get an A/A+ in math 1013 even if you do not attend any lectures and did not do any revision. If you cannot excel in math 1013 with an eye closed, go home.<br />2. Find some reference materials for math 1024 (lecture notes/ problem sets/ past papers). If you could understand 70% of the notes and do half of the problems correct, 1024 welcomes you. Otherwise, go home.<br />For those who do not dare to take 1024, but thinks 1014 is too boring, do the following:<br />1. Find a 1014 class that does not require any attendance.<br />2. Go to sit in 1024 classes instead. A range in 1014 should not be a problem.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Fong tries to make the lessons funny, which he succeeded. Just like other math teachers, there are all sorts of calculation mistakes, which makes the course really fun. Professor Fong explains things in a clear manner, but if you understand nothing when reading the notes yourself, do not expect this to change after the lectures. What you should really do is to learn most of the materials, then use the lectures to clear your doubts.",
            "comment_grading": "Since a gradebook is already provided downstairs, I am not going to say too much. If you have confirmed that you are eligible for the course, A range is not a problem at all. By saying this, I mean you could skip all classes, do zero revision and still get A range (I do not recommend you to do so though). With some effort, and a slice of luck, you might be able to get A+, which I somehow managed to do it (I do not know why).<br />Also, the grading speed is horrible in a sense that they could release grades 1 day after the exam, so make yourself prepared for the shock.",
            "comment_workload": "Weekly problem sets, which changed to bi-weekly after the midterm. Personally, I spend 3-4 hours on each set, 1-2 more extra hours on typesetting it for some bonus points. That should not be too difficult, but make sure you start working at least 5 days before the deadline if you want to finish it all on your own, as thinking time might be very long once you are stuck, and deadlines make people panic.<br />As for revision, you really should not need any revision, just do as much as you like. If you want to know, I spent about 1 hour on the final exam. Actually, this is the great thing for all math courses: revisions are absolutely useless.",
