Mostly about phrases, numbers 1-100, verbs, adjectives, grammar etc. <br /><br />Spanish in terms of pronunciation is quite straightforward&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'd need to keep in mind how to pronounce certain letters when reciting words. Depending on your linguistic background, the 'rolling r' sound could be challenging as well as the lisp sound in words- but that is less challenging and not required if you consider other Spanish dialects outside Spain i.e in Latin America. <br /><br />Verbs in particular can be pretty confusing as for every form- &quot;you play&quot;, &quot;I play&quot;, &quot;They play&quot;, &quot;we play&quot; there is a different word for each form so that will take some time to get used it and it is highly recommended to pay attention to the verbs. <br /><br />Otherwise other vocabulary can be learnt without much difficulty as they share so many words with English and is helpful if your English vocabulary is fairly wide. <br /><br />Nothing too challenging in Spanish compared to German and if you have learnt a Romance language before, it would be very easy I'd suppose. <br /><br />Book is expensive from the bookstore, so try buying second hand or getting an online version",

Discussion of Spanish cultures between us and her comes so naturally and she welcomes students to ask questions.
