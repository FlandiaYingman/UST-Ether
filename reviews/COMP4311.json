            "comment_content": "Honestly, it cannot be said that the content is bad. However, it is also certainly not amazing. There is a lot to be learned, but most of what is learned is also quite useless and not tested. The course covered conceptual modeling, schema integration, calculating costs of replicating databases, data warehouse schemas, navigational schemas, normalization, etc. There is a whole lot of content, and each chapter has ~100 slides, but you can get away with not actually knowing the material that well. One interesting aspect is that a lot of the content, such as navigational schemas, cannot be found through Google, and is not in the textbook. Did the professor make it up or something? I have no clue.",
            "comment_teaching": "Kenneth is quite an enthusiastic teacher, and attempts to construct a bit of class participation by blanking out key words in the slides so that students actually need to attend the class to find out what those words are. He explains concepts pretty well, and uses the whiteboard a bit, which I enjoy. He also gives out in-class exercises as a way of taking attendance during lectures. These are graded for completion.<br /><br />Oh, and the TA is a joke. By that I mean I have no idea what he says because his English is just awful. His handwriting is not very good and he frequently misspells words in ways that are really funny. However, you still have to sit in the tutorial sections watching him being a funny guy because there is attendance taken in tutorials. During the tutorial, the TA will give you some time to complete a few tutorial problems. He then copies the solution on the whiteboard from the answer key. End of tutorial. Sigh...",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is probably the best thing in this class. The overall grade can be quite high, even if your average is not really that good. Some studying might be needed to get a good grade, as well as some effort on the projects, but that's it really.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not too high at all. The course requires three projects, a conceptual schema design, a relational schema design, and a functional schema design. These are all a breeze, well, maybe not the functional schema because there are no online resources to help you. These shouldn't take you more than a day or two each to complete. Midterm was terrifying, but the average was low so it wasn't too bad. Final was about the same as the midterm.",

However,the Integration is the syllabus of mid term and it test many(Over 20%).<br /><br />many high gpa student would choose this course.(maybe they have strong interest of db in COMP3311)",
