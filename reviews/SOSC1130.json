To be honest, Professor Sharif goes out of his way to relate the subject matter to our every day life and make the course information more interesting and relatable. I really enjoyed learning about systems of innovation and the process of innovations and the industrial revolution.<br /><br />The content is very interesting for both science and business students alike since it really focuses on the impact of technology, how technology can affect economic development, interesting aspects about microinnovations, the interdependence of science and business. <br /><br />Moreover, it helps you gain a better perspective on our society and how technology has grown to shape it and has been shaped by it. I highly recommend the content of the course to people who would like to think more analytically about the world of science and business. The concepts learned are quite interesting and can be very philosophical. For example, we learned a part of the innovation process in businesses which involves reverse salients. Reverse salients are basically problems or weaknesses the innovation has which prevents it from developing further or diffusing more wider.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Sharif relates it back to the students in their attempt to grow telling us that sometimes all it takes is to identify the problem.",

I'm a science student seeing NO point why I should be taught “what science is” by a humanities' professor. <br /><br />I don't think we science students would understand less the workout of our own disciplines than humanities' men. <br /><br />Perhaps, Dr. Naubahar is compelled by the school to create such a course that he may even subconsciously flout.",

He did care about us a lot. <br /><br />He even offered, at the last lesson, to hire students as helpers to work for him in bettering his course at a rate of $40+/hour.

He is able to pin point some important information and successfully delivered to us.<br /><br />There are some video watching (some in Cantonese and some in English) during lectures which helps explain his point.<br /><br />Most importantly, the professor is willing to listen to students' opinion on this course and make adjustment to it.
