        "description": "This course aims to develop students' capacity for critical reflection.  To deal with human interactions in a global setting, we need to equip ourselves with a spectrum of understanding and responses that go beyond our parochial mind-set.  The course exposes students to issues outside the business field, providing an opportunity to explore relevant topics concerning their community, their world and themselves.  For GBUS students or students with consent from instructor.",

Who Am I â€“ What is my Personal Leadership Style?<br />2. What kind of Society do I want to live in?<br />3. What World do I believe we should build for the future?<br /><br />Content is pretty much self-explanatory, not much value added.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching style is boring, students tend to fall asleep in class. Professor has his own stance towards open-ended topics which makes it unfair to students with good individualistic mindsets. Classes tend to over-run whilst failing to cover the intended targets.",

The professor provides no guidance towards the essay which leads to confusion among students, resulting in terrible grades despite great essays. The final essay is an argumentative essay based on professor's chosen topic, however, the professor would prefer students to address topic areas which are out of the question's scope instead of going into the depth of the topic. &quot;logic flaw duh&quot;",
            "comment_workload": "Heavy workload with no rewards. Professor is biased towards different issues. For example, students are made to argue against something illogical which the professor has his own stance . This creates general confusions among the class. Workload is huge, 3 presentations, active Q&amp;A based on quality and quantity, as well as an essay which no one understood the grading criteria since it is not addressed.",

The funny thing here is that the question is asked like an open-ended one, while no rubric is provided. I happened to incorporate more topics as I felt that the case had multiple perspectives to it. However the instructor already expects to see certain points from your essay, and even if you write something that makes sense, but deviate from his grading methods, no points will be given as such is life. <br /><br />So some advice about the essay: find a case, and find ONE topic that aligns with the case. This is a gamble: sometimes things can get ambiguous. If you choose the wrong topic, https://counsel.ust.hk/.<br /><br />Well here's the messed up part: under new management, the A-range for this course has been shrunk down significantly, while B-range has expanded extensively. That means, as salty as I may sound, even if you did good in this course, just because did marginally less well than others, you could be a B student. And in GBUS, B = Bad.",
            "comment_workload": "A rather periodic workload that can be pretty intense at times.<br /><br />Mainly it would be reading a huge case and doing debate presentations on conversational topics; there are 2 of those debates throughout the course. Each team will represent one side of the topic. After every debate, there is a poll for students to vote on which side they support. The instructor goes on and off about whether he will be grading on the debate polling results at times. <br /><br />At the end of the course, you will have to choose a topic and present again based on the case questions.<br /><br />The presentations are all team presentations.<br /><br />For the final assignment, another hbs-type case for essay analysis.<br /><br />The workload is not the heaviest, but definitely not the best.",
