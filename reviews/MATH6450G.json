        "description": "This course covers some basic probabilistic methods and principles that arise frequently across a broad range of high-dimensional problems. Basic theoretical skills, such as concentration inequalities and suprema of random processes, for analyzing random vectors and random matrices will be introduced. Applications in machine learning, probabilistic combinatorics, and computer science will also be discussed.",
