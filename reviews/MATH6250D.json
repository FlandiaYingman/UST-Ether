        "description": "This course gives an introduction to basic notions on complex manifolds both on the algebraic side and on the analytic side, with an emphasis on compact complex manifolds. It will include sheaf theory, Cech cohomology, de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies, Hermitian and Kähler manifolds, Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles, harmonic forms, vanishing theorems, Kodaira’s Embedding Theorem and Chern classes. We will also examine examples of classical compact complex manifolds, starting with projective spaces and their dual manifolds, i.e., compact quotients of the complex unit ball by torsion-free discrete lattices, illustrating in concrete terms how some of the aforementioned basic notions can be applied to the study of such classical manifolds.
