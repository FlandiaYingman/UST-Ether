            "comment_content": "The course provides a basic but very well-structured framework of the marketing process, which is particularly useful not only for students aiming to be marketing professionals, but also anyone who wanna market himself when finding a job, selling his idea, etc.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Marketing Management<br />2Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing Research<br />3Ô∏è‚É£ Consumer Buyer Behavior<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Consumer Characteristics<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Buyer Decision Process<br />4Ô∏è‚É£ Segmenting, Targeting, and Positioning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Differentiation and Segmenting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Value Proposition - Targeting and Positioning<br />5Ô∏è‚É£ 4P's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Branding Strategy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Pricing Strategy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Marketing Channels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî∂ Promotion<br />6Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing Ethics and Social Responsibility <br /><br />The last lecture on ethics and social responsibility was especially rewarding. She introduced 'storydoing' and how enterprises nowadays could leverage the social power of 'storydoing', instead of 'storytelling', to increase the social impact their promotional campaign created. She even further covered how to become an influential and an inspiring person, by addressing the 'why' question first rather than the 'what' question - a 'why' question is the value proposition that brings about values to customers, whereas a 'what' question is the products or the services we deliver to the customers. This is explained by our intrinsic tendency to be influenced by emotions first, rather than rational thinking.<br /><br />This is one of the most useful and inspiring courses I've ever taken in UST.",
            "comment_teaching": "PUIG is indeed the weirdest professor I've ever seen, but she is hell passionate. Even though she's got the worst accent, the most exceptional style of clothing, a not-so-good body shape, whatever... I still LOVED her teaching. I felt like she was the mother of every single student. She cared about every one of us, fully understood our characters, and tried to help us learn in a way we didn't even notice. I've changed so much under her teaching that I feel like I've transformed into another person.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading on a pro-rata basis, i.e. every student is my competitor. The professor herself hated it a lot, but she had to follow the school regulation.<br /><br />From the moment I realized my competitors are CRAZILY capable - QFIN, Dual-degree students are not even worth mentioning. We've got curve wreckers from mainland China who've stayed in the US for quite a bit of time, or who've taken 60 credits in merely 1 year, a WBB student (the first time I've ever met one, tbh), exchange students from Ivy Leagues, public speaking champions, and even a 32-year-old lawyer who works in a professional law firm (DAMN it!!! Why would she ever go to take a marketing course in UST lol). Under such fierce competition, with my cr*ppy English speaking and presentation skills, and also because I'm such an introvert and I dared not speak in front of the whole class, I got a sh!tty grade at the end.<br /><br />Coursework weighting:<br />üìÇ In-class participation - 33%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üè´ Class attendance - 13%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üí¨ In-class activities - 20%<br />üìÇ Group project - 32%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úèÔ∏è Marketing plan (write-up) - 13%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üí¨ Marketing plan (presentation) - 7%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úèÔ∏è Case analysis - 12%<br />‚úèÔ∏è Final quiz - 35%<br /><br />Dunno how marks were given towards in-class activities. Maybe this is all about impression. I wonder if the professor knew my Chinese name?! This course is heavily weighted towards class participation and projects. The professor even tends to deliberately increase the deviation of our scores in these components to amplify the impact of these areas and tune down the impact of exams on our grades. For an inactive, taciturn, but exam-oriented person like me, this grading was obviously a headache. üòñ<br /><br />Overall a very Western-styled grading that emphasizes the importance of projects over exams. Well, I understand that. It makes no sense for a marketing course to be heavily weighted towards exams, anyway. But at last I couldn't secure my grade even though I burrowed through the final quiz cuz my project parts were already all f**ked up.<br /><br />In the projects our group was probably the one that encountered the most issues and problems - one group mate was not in Hong Kong for a total of 3 weeks (out of a course that lasted for only 5 weeks), having no choice but to leave everything behind to the rest of the group mates, and another group mate even 'disappeared' at the end. (WTF???) From a learning perspective, you should learn how to work with any person, yet if you consider your workload as well as your grade, you should choose your group mates carefully.<br /><br />My performance on each component:<br />‚úèÔ∏è Case analysis - below mean<br />‚úèÔ∏èüí¨ Marketing plan - below mean<br />üè´ Class attendance - full marks<br />üí¨ In-class activities - not shown, but 100% sure mine was f**ked up<br />‚úèÔ∏è Final quiz - above mean<br /><br />Final grade: B+<br /><br />I dunno how come I only got 6/12 in the case analysis. I didn't expect this part to be f**ked up like this when my group mates all thought we had submitted something normal... (???) And the professor said all our marketing plans in the whole class deserved an A-range, but I only got 13/20. Dunno what happened at the end. Maybe because of the peer evaluation?<br /><br />Tears~ üò≠üò≠üò≠<br /><br />My warning - DON'T take this course in summer. Students taking this course in summer are usually really into this course and hence the competition will be extremely fierce. Well, I learned a lot from my peers tho, but if you're taking it for the grade, then think twice before registering for a summer class.",
            "comment_workload": "This course is heavily weighted towards class participation and projects. You can thus imagine how much time I had to devote in this course - full attendance in class is mandatory and is merely basic.<br /><br />The heaviest workload is surely the marketing plan - every group had to go from the very beginning to develop an idea, go through the whole marketing process, and present the whole idea in front of the whole class. This is demanding for an introductory course, especially in summer, when the course typically only lasts for 5 weeks.<br /><br />The case analysis is another piece of sh!t - our case was an extract from an MBA year-2 course in Harvard business school. Ewwww I didn't understand fuck about the case as the case is on Beyonc√©, and I was a total music noob, so you can imagine how much effort I had to put in to sort things out and understand what the heck was going on. (But after I've got the whole idea I realized how brilliant her marketing strategy was. She did promotion in a way as if there was no promotion, and by doing so she deliberately created media speculation. Beyonc√©'s simply a marketing genius!!!)<br /><br />Anyway, heavy workload brings about good learning process. I did learn a lot from it, so I shouldn't have complained.",

Statistics were similar to previous years though, so trickiness likely has more to do than with your knowledge or study effort.<br /><br />Recitation for the 10% class participation was competitive, with up to 15/50 people in the class raising their hands for one question. Obviously, professor can't call everyone, but she does 3-5 people. Recitation opportunities become more infrequent with progression of the course, so try to recite early (e.g. barely any during topics for Quiz 3).<br /><br />The final project, both report and presentation, was hard-carry for me.

Unfortunately, according to the grading scale in HKUST (executed by her and the ARRO), she would receive a C (well that's pretty reflect students' fates in UST!)<br /><br />She hopes to make the class interactive but she clearly failed to do so.<br /><br />(1) She bans mobile phone and laptop in class. The rationale was &quot;to encourage the atmosphere of learning and interaction&quot;. We have reflected that appropriate use of electronic devices to facilitate learning should be encouraged in a questionnaire after 1/3 of the course but it was rejected<br /><br />(2) She would ask questions to the class, but the questions are not in-depth enough to provoke thoughts or encourage further discussion. She would ask for something mentioned on PowerPoint Slides but seldom further the discussion on other forms of application. (But she mentioned that it is important to learn how to apply concepts)<br /><br />(3) Therefore, under such great expectation fall from &quot;her insights&quot; and the &quot;reality&quot;, many students do not show up in classes. In last regular classes (before presentation), only ~10 people are sitting at a 70-people classroom. I would like to express a little bit sympathy to KIM but honestly if she could release some of the regulations and think of some strategies to further stimulates discussion<br /><br />(4) I would like to *compliment* KIM's as a person that she is nice, and she is a good business professor. Although her teaching is not excellent in MARK2120, I believe she is a good and inspirational &quot;ËÄÅÁ¥∞&quot; if you are pursuing in postgraduates studies. She had experiences in UCLA, INSEAD (well I suspect she should come from an extremely well-off from South Korea), and honestly her suggestions on your Projects, Research Observations Exercises are EXTREMELY beneficial, thought-provoking.<br /><br />** FYI, she seems to be using unedited PowerPoint Slides to teach the classes from Professor Anirban back in 3/4 years ago",

(This is not Kim's fault but the problem of MARK2120 Syllabus - Marketing should not turn out become a subject for recitation but application)<br /><br />Kim's Quizzes are very difficult. Many minor concepts or concepts not mentioned or teaching content in classes will be assessed. And many options of MCQ are ambiguous. Prepare yourself with Mock Question Sets (by Pearson) would be very good because some (well actually quite a lot) questions would be adopted from there.<br /><br />In Quiz 2, the questions were too difficult and many of students screwed that Professor and Teaching team need to add 3 points to each student. (There are MANY Ambiguous Questions - They want to make the questions more challenging and to differentiate good and bad students but it was totally failed)<br /><br />6% goes to Research Participation.

Conduct a thorough analysis of the marketing environment and understand how environmental forces influence marketing decision-making.<br />4.

Casual and informal; can chill and loosen up in her lessons<br />3. Encourages raising questions: does not mind being cut off at all if someone wants to ask a question<br />4. Lenient in grading: I think impression and confidence are important in this course<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Usually late for class lol (~ 5 mins, but always ends on time), and sometimes absent (there was one time when the whole class was physically in the classroom while she taught on Zoom, and another time when she cancelled a 9 am class within an hour before the start)<br />2. Strong European accent: might be hard to hear what she is saying since the pronunciation may be off <br /><br />Coral is well-known for encouraging participation and discussion, so many people think her classes are only for extroverts. How it works is that you need to ask or answer a meaningful question to get one participation mark, with 10 marks being the maximum (contributes to 10% of your total grade). <br /><br />The TA, Jasmine Leung, is pretty incompetent and I am very disappointed. She is always not paying enough attention in lectures. She's in charge of uploading the slides to Canvas, but she always uploads the slides halfway through the class (so how am I supposed to take notes with my iPad?). She is also the one responsible for recording the participation marks but due to not paying enough attention in classes, I think she missed some participation records as well. Better ask her to confirm your participation every time after the lesson. She is the only reason that I gave &quot;B&quot; but not &quot;A&quot; for teaching.",

Why? Because if you don't answer the way she wants or expects you to, she gives you shit in front of the whole class. Unlike my other group projects, she makes two people out of a team of six present, and then after the presentation, she gives her thoughts and criticism - and mind you this comes across as very harsh (especially if it's bad, and it likely will be). If you get her through pre-reg honestly just drop and try to get into another class because she is genuinely horrible.",

But again, Christine's manner when it comes to someone participating is harsh and unwarranted - so no one really wants to participate and answer questions during her lectures. In her eyes, it's either her way or no way. The biggest aspect of the grade percentage is the group project (this includes your in-class exercises). If you get a terrible team this basically will ruin your grade. I ended up with a B (because I never participated) and I had groupmates and I had to carry the project with another groupmate.

She is also responsive to emails and is very willing to provide assistance for you. It is doubtless that she is a good person to deal with, however, as this part is talking about teaching, I can only give a C-range to her (according to the ust grading way). The reason I do so is that she wasn't teaching too much, what she was doing is to blowwater and share her thoughts. She could stay on the same slide for an hour and just talking about her thoughts. I would say she will be very appropiate to teach MRKT on Youtube, but not in UST, in the latter case, you will definitely have to rely on the textbook and self-studying quite a lot to strike for a good grade. Putting teaching aside, she is nice, and of course, very humorous guy, so her lectures are not boring, but still, it is still a 9am class, so you better think twice before registering into it. She has some strong accents, but I think it is manageable. You can feel free to email her about any problems or random thoughts (e.g. MIRROR, yellow shopping circle in HK) about marketing you have, just make her remember you and to provide fedbacks to her teaching progress, which can help her a lot too.",

Make sure you find good groupmates, they can help you a lot in the project, do not be afraid of asking people whether you can join their group or not, if you come up with groups containing free-riders, you will be fucked up, so don't hesistate to find groupmates yourself, otherwise, the TA will help you do so and she might get you into some troubles if you are unlucky. If you are talkative and like speaking in class, this course suits you a lot. The prof will not force people to participate, but she really appreciate it if you could speak up, talking about sth wrong is okay, she will help you and will not make you embarrased.

That's why I suggest you to read the textbook or slides by other professors (earlier than her lectures).&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be helpful.

Her English is good (although has a bit accent), and she delivers concept in a very clear way (e.g. give some real-life examples). Some in-class exercises really help to understand the concept. There are also consultation sessions for you to ask questions about your group project, and she will give you detailed comments.

For the individual class participation, it is really important to attend and raise hand in every lecture so that Sophie will remember your name, and this counts a lot to your final grade.<br /><br />Quizzes are not so difficult, they are all MC questions (will ask some questions about applying concepts in real world). <br />However, the options are quite ambiguous. Even after you finished the quizzes and check the notes, you will still not sure about your answer. As a result, no one get full marks in any of these quizzes.

You can understand marketing from a different perspective.<br />There are some guest lectures, you can attend according to your own interest.

I love the TED talk she shared and the advertisements she played during the class. The comments and reflections of these videos helped me undertand and reflect a lot about life and of course marketing.<br />Experienced expert in the field of marketing.<br />I had attended her sharing to other mannagers of big companys before taking this course(Also the reason why I chose this course).<br />She always talked about her accent and sometimes couldn't pronounce 'that word' but I think it's fun and cute haha.",

(I have very nice groupmates :) )<br /><br />To study for final quiz, you can check the last slides of the powerpoint which highlighted the main idea for each class.<br />Don't worry if you attend all lecture and be punctual. Prof would tell these students what would be the main questions in exam and what pages of textbook are important. And the quiz is very easy if you attend the leacture.<br /><br />Amazing grading. <br /><br />I think quite a number of students are in A range since Prof. Puig don't care about the curving during summer semester. She think if you deserve an A then you should have it.",

She includes a lot of her own experiences and examples in her presentations, and she likes to repeat important concepts a lot in all of her lectures to make sure we remember. And it works quite well. The only thing is her accent: it is so heavy. So unless you are able to understand her Spanish accent, you will not have a good time (or good grade) in her class.",

Attendance is not mandatory in her class, but your chances at getting a good final grade will increase greatly if she knows you on a first name basis. If you succeed in getting her to remember you, you will not only have a more favorable impression, she will call on you more in class so you get more chances to get participation points. So just attend and participate more in class. It really helps.",

There are 2 short essays that need to be completed at some point throughout the semester, but as long as the topic is related to class content and your use of technical terms is correct, you're pretty much guaranteed to get full marks on those. The only things that need more effort required is the group project and the final exam.",

The Group Exercise and Individual Class Participation are quite subjective so I don't consider the grading system a fair one, as you get a higher score if Sophie remembers you.

Also, study the sample quiz questions as some similar questions appear in the actual quiz.<br /><br />The project report and present score didn't release.<br /><br />For individual parti, I speak up every lesson and June remembers me. I think I get a high score for parti. One very important reminder is that not only answering questions can get a score, but asking questions and speaking out your comments are also positively contributing to the class and could get scores according to the syllabus. <br /><br />In my opinion, the scores for group projects and quizzes are similar among all students. When graded by curve, what makes your score stand out would be the parti score as you can get 10 more scores than others if you speak up actively.<br /><br />The grading is super lenient.

The final project also consisted of a groupwork where your group would write up a marketing project for a company, and present it. However, the course did not nearly prepare us enough for the task, and in fact all the topics in the later ends of the course end up rushed, with the last few not even discussed more than 30 minutes each. Attendance is required and part of a grade, she also encourages you to speak up during class and be proactive as it gives u an extra +/- 10% grade on ur final mark.",
            "comment_teaching": "Unfocused teaching, Whilst Prof Kim has decent english and teaching skills, she only delves into the surface layer of material and expects you to dive in-depth on your own into the textbook, not to mention she always suddenly rants about psychology in the middle of the class that take up large amounts of time. Also, if you write to her with questions about any topic or question, she will not respond instead asking you to figure it out for yourself. Overrall, unsatisfactory performance. The TAs weren't really involved in teaching so nothing to say about them.",

I would say make sure to communicate with Coral, by which I mean talking to her after class or emailing her from time to time to update her about your progress and to get her opinions on your work. Coral is super generous about providing comments and is super nice to students who approach her.<br /><br />Class participation matters a lot in this class. Basically same as every other courses in ust that includes class participation in grading. Coral gives a lot of opportunities for people to answer and to earn their scores. It can be sometimes stressful speaking in front of the class, but whether you are a local student or not, the whole purpose of university education is to train you for workplace interaction. If you find speaking in a class where the teacher's duty is to help you learn unbearable, you might as well consider another career direction.",

If you skip lecture and miss attendance, then it will be a minus.<br /><br />Do prepare for 3 quizzes even though you can drop one, if you want to get good grade, it might be competitive since mean is quite high.",

In between, there is rigorous analysis of the customer, the <br />competition, the environment, and the company‚Äôs own capabilities. The second set of activities <br />revolves around the ‚Äúmarketing mix‚Äù, commonly referred to as the 4 P‚Äôs (product, placement, price <br />and promotion). Marketing mix activities include letting the consumer know about the product in an <br />attention-getting, convincing and motivating way, getting it to the consumer through the best <br />combination of distribution channels, pricing it effectively, and offering incentives to try, purchase, <br />and re-purchase.",

My advice to all of you is to get full mark in the first quiz as that is the easiest. After you get 100% in the first quiz, do not look forward to another 100% in the second or even the third one. They are much harder!!<br /><br />The +/-10% participation is worthwhile to say something in class. You may not get full mark even though you participate every class like the extroverts do. But, you can get a decent participation score for participating every 2-3 lectures. The first few times of participation always help the most.",

There are also consultation sessions for you to ask questions about your group project, and she will give you detailed comments.

Even after you finished the quizzes and check the notes, I will still not sure about your answer. As a result, no one get full marks in any of these quizzes. But if you pay attention in every lecture, you should have no problem with the quiz.<br />Since it is an online examination, it is close-book and pen is not allowed.<br /><br />WORKLOAD<br /><br />The workload is pretty low.

I attended some of the f2f classes and Jospeh could remember my name afterwards.<br /><br />Group project (30%): Interim Report (5%) + Written Report (15%) + Presentation (10%)<br />Only interim report posted comments but without grade (excellent report with good research). In fact, I was carried by a team of intelligent groupmates and the final written report and presentation were really damn good.<br /><br />Pop up quizzes and In-class exercise (17%): No pop up quizzes at all and there were just 3 or 4 in-class exercises throught the whole semester. You will be doing the exercises with your groupmates so I was being carried again. <br /><br />Research Participation (3%): Just remember to register and finish before the due time when you receive email notification about marketing research and I got full score here.<br /><br />Final grade: A+",

He had uploaded some pre-recorded videos for us but he only uploaded like 2 days before the deadline submission, so I have to watch YouTube and read textbook myself.<br /><br />For quizzes, not much workload as I just watched the lecture videos back before the exam (around 6-8 videos for one quiz), so I can just spend 1 to 2 days to watch all by using 2X speed.",

In terms of in-class activities, professor will usually announce when there is a in-class activities and remind people to join, so better not miss it. Academic research is quite chill as well, you just need to do a few survey then you can easily get all the bonus point. Just to reminded that to register ASAP when there is a new survey release so you don't have to worry about it anymore later in the semester. <br /><br />The mean is always super high and if you miss a few points, it is probably you will be below mean.

He can make the contents more attractive by adding in examples and keep students attentive by organizing discussions in class. Sometimes he would like to talk about stories or jokes about himself, which I personally think are quite interesting. But he may teach a little fast from time to time, so it would be better if you can read the slides before class.<br />And I really think Prof. Wang is charming and has a lot to be learnt from in terms of personality. You can see passion, profession and intelligence on him.",
            "comment_grading": "Actually I was very worried at the begginning hearing about how Wenbo was a &quot;killer&quot;. But it turned out that my grade is better than I imagined, didn't drag down by GPA so much.<br />We only had two quizes this semester and the better one was counted. We didn't have the presentation and its weight was added to the written report.<br />Here are the statistics:<br />quizes: mean: 21/25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.5/25&nbsp;&nbsp;high: 25/25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24/25<br />mine: 21/25, 22/25&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The scores for report and participation were enclosed.<br />Research credit: 3/3<br />Final grade: B+ (Thank you Wenbo, I thought I might get a B- or C+)<br />I think the key to this course is to be proactive in class and make the professor remember you. Speak up as much as possible. If you aim at A range, I think answering or raising at least one question each class is a must. <br />Quiz and project are also very important. Plz remember to recite every examples in slides clearly and pay attention to the examples told in class as well. They would all be tested in quizes and could be confusing.<br />For the project, I personally think the professor put more importance on the logic than the creativity of idea. Your customer demand and market size should be strongly supported by data from research, instead of just &quot;blowing water&quot;. If you have time, it'd be a good idea to make an appointment with him in advance and ask him what he want from the report.",

With that said, as you can pick your own group, just make sure you pick one with minimal free-riders to get the work done.<br />*Considering how popular many of these case studies are, you can definitely Google them and find the key points that will aid your class discussions.",

Plot twist: I ditched 5 of his lessons whole semester and had never arrived punctually (being late for 5-30 mins). School is not a place for smart people.<br /><br />Yeah maybe his grading is slightly worse than others but hey what are you in for. The knowledge or the gpa? He teaches you about marketing yourself in the last lesson (tho I skipped it), he teaches you how to be smarter, he teaches you practical skills in marketing, he teaches you lifelong attitude and provides you insightful advice. He is a good teacher but he doesn't give lenient grades to students. Maybe he just has a high expectations kept on us. So try your best in class and hope for the best! I like him.",

You have group discussions on these materials and he will ask you in the quiz the questions your group was assigned on to check that you are not a free-rider. But no in-depth questions.",

He likes to ask questions and expects free flow and interesting answers from students. He has a lot of interesting views towards marketing and business decisions.<br /><br />However, he does not include everything in his powerpoint, so make sure you copy what he says regarding business decisions in cases, as they may be covered during the quizzes.",

Group Exercise (10%)<br />5. Research Credit (3%), individual work<br />6. Individual Class Participation (10%), individual work<br /><br />The quiz covers class powerpoints, and sometimes questions on group exercises and group work to make sure no one is free riding.<br /><br />The group project is on a service or product that exists/not does exist. You need to talk about the 3Cs, 4Ps and STP, and also the marketing framework, expected implementation timeline, finances etc. So imagine you are a start-up doing pitches and that's what your project will need to include.<br /><br />Research credit stuff will be sent through email.<br /><br />Group exercises are on business cases from Harvard and other schools. A class will be dedicated to discussing the case (2-3 in total throughout the year) and answering assigned group questions.<br /><br />Individual class participation is not part of the 100% of the course grade. But you will get an extra + or - 10% (max) depending on how much you are of a positive/negative influence in class. So answer more questions and impress Wenbo with good answers, and don't doze off or chat in class as you could get marks deducted any time.<br /><br />I got almost full marks for all three of my quizzes and our group did okay during presentation and the report. I also did not speak up much during class. Finally got an A-range, even though I was expecting a B-range for not being active in class! I think the group presentation is extremely important, so get good groupmates.",

There are quizzes once in a while but it's okay as if you pay attention in class, quiz should be okay.<br /><br />Group project is tougher as Wenbo briefs the guidelines rather late (but I heard it's the same for every other class). And you have to start things from scratch. But there is sufficient time as long as you make group decisions quick (i.e. what service/product you are going to do), and don't make last minute changes.",

However, she would always digress every now and then and tell stories from her company and experiences and that's where the class gets interesting.

(The first or second class).",

Maybe try to not get below mean is already enough.<br /><br />All 3 quizzes are taken into account as opposed to other professors.",
            "comment_workload": "Studying for the quiz are not very hard, sparing several hours before the actual quiz is enough.<br />She basically guides you through the merketing case analysis about Beyonce, so no added workload.<br />She also encouraged us to start the marketing plan early and helped us throughout. She almost always spares the last 20 minutes of class every week to check our progress with the plan and for consultation. Just make sure you do what she told you to do and you will be her favorite group.",

Just sit in and do it yourself. Nothing too difficult. <br />My overall grade was still slightly lower than expected (we did especially well for our final project.

What is good about his teaching is he uses the examples that the students are familiar of. He likes to give students the big picture of the course, so that you can link each lecture session with the previous lecture sessions. Highly recommend you guys to take his class. <br /><br />I enjoy how he encourage students to give out their ideas and analyze the examples/ topic he teaches,",

To ace the quiz, you definitely need to attend the lectures as Professor Anirban like to test something he said in class. Also, make sure you jotted down the examples he gave. <br /><br />2. Project Report is a Marketing Plan that you make for a company, by analyzing the 3Cs, setting the STP, and formulating the 4Ps. When I took his class, it was about setting up marketing plan of a new restaurant for a particular restaurant group. This is done per group (5-6 people).<br /><br />3. Presentation is about presenting your final report/marketing plan. <br /><br />4. ORE is a observation exercise that is done usually by 2 people. Students are asked to observe consumers' behavior and activities, then just report what you observed and what insights you can provide. You can choose any consuming activity, up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Lastly, participating in the class will certainly be beneficial for you and gain you participation marks, you can ask questions or give out your ideas. He recognizes all of his students. And since people get high scores or score the same on quizzes, participation mark could give students another chance to increase their grades. <br /><br />Best 2 Quizzes : Total 50%<br />Final Project Report: 25%<br />Project Presentation: 10% <br />Observational Research Exercise: 10%<br />In-Class Group Exercises: 2%<br />Research Participation: 3%<br />Class Participation: +/- 5%",

In my opinion, I do not think that you need to buy the book, as the previous versions are just similar to the latest one, except that the examples and design might be different.

In the whole course, you will learn basic marketing concepts and knowledge. <br /><br />For Wenbo classes, in the first lesson you will be given a summary of what you will be learning in the whole semester. After that, materials will be elaborated more clearly, mostly focuses on 4Ps (Product, Price, Promotion and Position) and 3Cs (Customer, Company and Competition).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Wenbo does not require you to use textbook, you only need to use his PPTs and it would be fine. For his PPTs, it is quite clear and not much to momorize, most of the time he will use case to elaborate the concepts and ideas, you will just need to listen what he said and have a brief understanding than it would be fine for your quiz.",
            "comment_teaching": "To be honest, Wenbo is also one of my most favorite Professor. He is funny and always make jokes.

Quiz 3 result didn't announce. I get full make in research (You need to participate 3 research study). But I got B+ only. I guess the marks is very competitive and you need to answer questions in class, project mark may also affect your grade.",

Yo may need some time to meet up with groupmates to discuss.",

In terms of the group project, you're allowed to form your own groups, so don't work with free-riders! The majority of the workload is from the Clocky case study and the Marketing Plan at the end of the semester, and to do a good job, you'll have to put in a lot of effort.

Basically, you can't get much from this professor, maybe she will improve.<br /><br />First, her presentation has a large room for improvement, it is difficult for you to understand what she is talking about. She has strong mainland accent which makes her presentation even more difficult to understand. To be honest, only a few students will listen to her in class.<br /><br />Second, don't find her for consultation during the assigned timeslots(2 times theoughout the semester, 10 minutes each), she will confuse you and being confused by you, then she will keep agreeing with you, but I heard that turns out she was not satisfied by what she approved. Finding her after class or office hours makes more sense.<br /><br />However, she is quite willing to improve, obviously the lessons are easier for us to catch up and understand at the last stage of the course. <br /><br />One more thing, she tends to add some economics and mathematics knowledge in the course, which are not covered in other lectures.",

This is the most horrible part in the course. It is really hard to find a strategy that is easy to illustrate and can satisfy her fully. <br /><br />Lastly, the marketing project, she tends to give similar marks to all groups. One point to get a better grade: try to find special/new/luxury goods for your project.<br /><br />Our clocky case was just counted as inclass group exercise, however, some lectures counted these seperately and it takes up 1x% of the course grade for them.

Didn't have to read too much from textbook but just a bit to further fully understand the concepts, which help out for the quizzes. Attendance is quite important (10% + pop quizzes) in his class as he makes everyone sign the sheet before class and if he remembers your name. It also benefits because 10% is class participation so try to voice out as much as you can and 10% is yours.",

Bear in mind that the quizzes are quite tricky and that you might easily get tricked. Unlike other MCs, her quizzes have no fixed amount of answers, you can select all 5 options in an MCQ. Make sure you understand the question and each answer thoroughly.<br /><br />Sophie helped us by underlining some keywords and bold them, which helps in some sense, but in general... meh, some of the answers are still so ambiguous. Choosing one more option or one less would only grant you 0 marks. Also, make sure you watch/ attend all lessons of her class because many of the quizzes questions are from in-class discussions or points that are not typed in the slides.<br /><br />Expect a heavy workload towards the end of the semester, when you have to finish 10 pages of the business plan report (using the 3Cs, 4Ps, and stuff), as well as 15-20 minutes of presentation.
