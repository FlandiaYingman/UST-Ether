            "comment_content": "The course provides a basic but very well-structured framework of the marketing process, which is particularly useful not only for students aiming to be marketing professionals, but also anyone who wanna market himself when finding a job, selling his idea, etc.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />1️⃣ Introduction to Marketing Management<br />2️⃣ Marketing Research<br />3️⃣ Consumer Buyer Behavior<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Consumer Characteristics<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Buyer Decision Process<br />4️⃣ Segmenting, Targeting, and Positioning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Differentiation and Segmenting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Value Proposition - Targeting and Positioning<br />5️⃣ 4P's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Branding Strategy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Pricing Strategy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Marketing Channels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔶 Promotion<br />6️⃣ Marketing Ethics and Social Responsibility <br /><br />The last lecture on ethics and social responsibility was especially rewarding. She introduced 'storydoing' and how enterprises nowadays could leverage the social power of 'storydoing', instead of 'storytelling', to increase the social impact their promotional campaign created. She even further covered how to become an influential and an inspiring person, by addressing the 'why' question first rather than the 'what' question - a 'why' question is the value proposition that brings about values to customers, whereas a 'what' question is the products or the services we deliver to the customers. This is explained by our intrinsic tendency to be influenced by emotions first, rather than rational thinking.<br /><br />This is one of the most useful and inspiring courses I've ever taken in UST.",
            "comment_teaching": "PUIG is indeed the weirdest professor I've ever seen, but she is hell passionate. Even though she's got the worst accent, the most exceptional style of clothing, a not-so-good body shape, whatever... I still LOVED her teaching. I felt like she was the mother of every single student. She cared about every one of us, fully understood our characters, and tried to help us learn in a way we didn't even notice. I've changed so much under her teaching that I feel like I've transformed into another person.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading on a pro-rata basis, i.e. every student is my competitor. The professor herself hated it a lot, but she had to follow the school regulation.<br /><br />From the moment I realized my competitors are CRAZILY capable - QFIN, Dual-degree students are not even worth mentioning. We've got curve wreckers from mainland China who've stayed in the US for quite a bit of time, or who've taken 60 credits in merely 1 year, a WBB student (the first time I've ever met one, tbh), exchange students from Ivy Leagues, public speaking champions, and even a 32-year-old lawyer who works in a professional law firm (DAMN it!!! Why would she ever go to take a marketing course in UST lol). Under such fierce competition, with my cr*ppy English speaking and presentation skills, and also because I'm such an introvert and I dared not speak in front of the whole class, I got a sh!tty grade at the end.<br /><br />Coursework weighting:<br />📂 In-class participation - 33%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🏫 Class attendance - 13%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💬 In-class activities - 20%<br />📂 Group project - 32%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✏️ Marketing plan (write-up) - 13%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💬 Marketing plan (presentation) - 7%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✏️ Case analysis - 12%<br />✏️ Final quiz - 35%<br /><br />Dunno how marks were given towards in-class activities. Maybe this is all about impression. I wonder if the professor knew my Chinese name?! This course is heavily weighted towards class participation and projects. The professor even tends to deliberately increase the deviation of our scores in these components to amplify the impact of these areas and tune down the impact of exams on our grades. For an inactive, taciturn, but exam-oriented person like me, this grading was obviously a headache. 😖<br /><br />Overall a very Western-styled grading that emphasizes the importance of projects over exams. Well, I understand that. It makes no sense for a marketing course to be heavily weighted towards exams, anyway. But at last I couldn't secure my grade even though I burrowed through the final quiz cuz my project parts were already all f**ked up.<br /><br />In the projects our group was probably the one that encountered the most issues and problems - one group mate was not in Hong Kong for a total of 3 weeks (out of a course that lasted for only 5 weeks), having no choice but to leave everything behind to the rest of the group mates, and another group mate even 'disappeared' at the end. (WTF???) From a learning perspective, you should learn how to work with any person, yet if you consider your workload as well as your grade, you should choose your group mates carefully.<br /><br />My performance on each component:<br />✏️ Case analysis - below mean<br />✏️💬 Marketing plan - below mean<br />🏫 Class attendance - full marks<br />💬 In-class activities - not shown, but 100% sure mine was f**ked up<br />✏️ Final quiz - above mean<br /><br />Final grade: B+<br /><br />I dunno how come I only got 6/12 in the case analysis. I didn't expect this part to be f**ked up like this when my group mates all thought we had submitted something normal... (???) And the professor said all our marketing plans in the whole class deserved an A-range, but I only got 13/20. Dunno what happened at the end. Maybe because of the peer evaluation?<br /><br />Tears~ 😭😭😭<br /><br />My warning - DON'T take this course in summer. Students taking this course in summer are usually really into this course and hence the competition will be extremely fierce. Well, I learned a lot from my peers tho, but if you're taking it for the grade, then think twice before registering for a summer class.",
            "comment_workload": "This course is heavily weighted towards class participation and projects. You can thus imagine how much time I had to devote in this course - full attendance in class is mandatory and is merely basic.<br /><br />The heaviest workload is surely the marketing plan - every group had to go from the very beginning to develop an idea, go through the whole marketing process, and present the whole idea in front of the whole class. This is demanding for an introductory course, especially in summer, when the course typically only lasts for 5 weeks.<br /><br />The case analysis is another piece of sh!t - our case was an extract from an MBA year-2 course in Harvard business school. Ewwww I didn't understand fuck about the case as the case is on Beyoncé, and I was a total music noob, so you can imagine how much effort I had to put in to sort things out and understand what the heck was going on. (But after I've got the whole idea I realized how brilliant her marketing strategy was. She did promotion in a way as if there was no promotion, and by doing so she deliberately created media speculation. Beyoncé's simply a marketing genius!!!)<br /><br />Anyway, heavy workload brings about good learning process. I did learn a lot from it, so I shouldn't have complained.",

Statistics were similar to previous years though, so trickiness likely has more to do than with your knowledge or study effort.<br /><br />Recitation for the 10% class participation was competitive, with up to 15/50 people in the class raising their hands for one question. Obviously, professor can't call everyone, but she does 3-5 people. Recitation opportunities become more infrequent with progression of the course, so try to recite early (e.g. barely any during topics for Quiz 3).<br /><br />The final project, both report and presentation, was hard-carry for me.

Unfortunately, according to the grading scale in HKUST (executed by her and the ARRO), she would receive a C (well that's pretty reflect students' fates in UST!)<br /><br />She hopes to make the class interactive but she clearly failed to do so.<br /><br />(1) She bans mobile phone and laptop in class. The rationale was &quot;to encourage the atmosphere of learning and interaction&quot;. We have reflected that appropriate use of electronic devices to facilitate learning should be encouraged in a questionnaire after 1/3 of the course but it was rejected<br /><br />(2) She would ask questions to the class, but the questions are not in-depth enough to provoke thoughts or encourage further discussion. She would ask for something mentioned on PowerPoint Slides but seldom further the discussion on other forms of application. (But she mentioned that it is important to learn how to apply concepts)<br /><br />(3) Therefore, under such great expectation fall from &quot;her insights&quot; and the &quot;reality&quot;, many students do not show up in classes. In last regular classes (before presentation), only ~10 people are sitting at a 70-people classroom. I would like to express a little bit sympathy to KIM but honestly if she could release some of the regulations and think of some strategies to further stimulates discussion<br /><br />(4) I would like to *compliment* KIM's as a person that she is nice, and she is a good business professor. Although her teaching is not excellent in MARK2120, I believe she is a good and inspirational &quot;老細&quot; if you are pursuing in postgraduates studies. She had experiences in UCLA, INSEAD (well I suspect she should come from an extremely well-off from South Korea), and honestly her suggestions on your Projects, Research Observations Exercises are EXTREMELY beneficial, thought-provoking.<br /><br />** FYI, she seems to be using unedited PowerPoint Slides to teach the classes from Professor Anirban back in 3/4 years ago",

(This is not Kim's fault but the problem of MARK2120 Syllabus - Marketing should not turn out become a subject for recitation but application)<br /><br />Kim's Quizzes are very difficult. Many minor concepts or concepts not mentioned or teaching content in classes will be assessed. And many options of MCQ are ambiguous. Prepare yourself with Mock Question Sets (by Pearson) would be very good because some (well actually quite a lot) questions would be adopted from there.<br /><br />In Quiz 2, the questions were too difficult and many of students screwed that Professor and Teaching team need to add 3 points to each student.

It will also help them develop skills necessary to analyse marketing problems leading to the development of strategic and tactical plans consistent with analysis. Students in this course are expected to be able to:<br />1. Explain and discuss the general concepts about marketing management and the marketing process.<br />2. Identify and explain the key elements of a marketing plan.<br />3. Conduct a thorough analysis of the marketing environment and understand how environmental forces influence marketing decision-making.<br />4. Identify sources of marketing information necessary to develop a marketing plan.<br />5. Discuss consumer and buyer behavior models as they influence customer purchase decision-making.<br />6.

Casual and informal; can chill and loosen up in her lessons<br />3. Encourages raising questions: does not mind being cut off at all if someone wants to ask a question<br />4. Lenient in grading: I think impression and confidence are important in this course<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Usually late for class lol (~ 5 mins, but always ends on time), and sometimes absent (there was one time when the whole class was physically in the classroom while she taught on Zoom, and another time when she cancelled a 9 am class within an hour before the start)<br />2. Strong European accent: might be hard to hear what she is saying since the pronunciation may be off <br /><br />Coral is well-known for encouraging participation and discussion, so many people think her classes are only for extroverts. How it works is that you need to ask or answer a meaningful question to get one participation mark, with 10 marks being the maximum (contributes to 10% of your total grade). <br /><br />The TA, Jasmine Leung, is pretty incompetent and I am very disappointed. She is always not paying enough attention in lectures. She's in charge of uploading the slides to Canvas, but she always uploads the slides halfway through the class (so how am I supposed to take notes with my iPad?). She is also the one responsible for recording the participation marks but due to not paying enough attention in classes, I think she missed some participation records as well.

Need to read around 10 pages of materials and answer around 3 to 4 questions for each assignment. Answer the professor's questions after group discussion during class (Pick one group representative)<br /><br />Research credit: Just complete 3 sections and earn all the credits. It only takes you less than 1 hour for each section.<br /><br />Group project: Make sure you have contributive groupmates and everything will be fine. To be honest, try to be the group leader if you want a good grade as you can realize it from the part of grading :) <br />But it is quite fun during the entire process of research, discussion and making the slides and written report <br /><br />In conclusion, the workload for the individual tasks is not heavy while the workload for the group project fluctuates (it depends on the communication and work distribution within the group)<br /><br />Anyway hope that you can get a good grade :)",

In order to force students to have to attend her lectures, she doesn't provide the lecture videos, and even though participation can affect your grade little to no people ever answer questions during lectures. Why? Because if you don't answer the way she wants or expects you to, she gives you shit in front of the whole class. Unlike my other group projects, she makes two people out of a team of six present, and then after the presentation, she gives her thoughts and criticism - and mind you this comes across as very harsh (especially if it's bad, and it likely will be). If you get her through pre-reg honestly just drop and try to get into another class because she is genuinely horrible.",

But again, Christine's manner when it comes to someone participating is harsh and unwarranted - so no one really wants to participate and answer questions during her lectures. In her eyes, it's either her way or no way. The biggest aspect of the grade percentage is the group project (this includes your in-class exercises). If you get a terrible team this basically will ruin your grade. I ended up with a B (because I never participated) and I had groupmates and I had to carry the project with another groupmate.

            "comment_teaching": "Professor Puig is definitely a very kind person, she is very passionate and is very willing to talk to you either in class or after class. She is also responsive to emails and is very willing to provide assistance for you. It is doubtless that she is a good person to deal with, however, as this part is talking about teaching, I can only give a C-range to her (according to the ust grading way). The reason I do so is that she wasn't teaching too much, what she was doing is to blowwater and share her thoughts. She could stay on the same slide for an hour and just talking about her thoughts. I would say she will be very appropiate to teach MRKT on Youtube, but not in UST, in the latter case, you will definitely have to rely on the textbook and self-studying quite a lot to strike for a good grade. Putting teaching aside, she is nice, and of course, very humorous guy, so her lectures are not boring, but still, it is still a 9am class, so you better think twice before registering into it. She has some strong accents, but I think it is manageable. You can feel free to email her about any problems or random thoughts (e.g. MIRROR, yellow shopping circle in HK) about marketing you have, just make her remember you and to provide fedbacks to her teaching progress, which can help her a lot too.",

If you are like me, who just want to pass this course asap and avoid the bullshit pre-reg system in sbm, then it is still worth-taking. Make sure you find good groupmates, they can help you a lot in the project, do not be afraid of asking people whether you can join their group or not, if you come up with groups containing free-riders, you will be fucked up, so don't hesistate to find groupmates yourself, otherwise, the TA will help you do so and she might get you into some troubles if you are unlucky. If you are talkative and like speaking in class, this course suits you a lot. The prof will not force people to participate, but she really appreciate it if you could speak up, talking about sth wrong is okay, she will help you and will not make you embarrased. So think about it yourself~",

That's why I suggest you to read the textbook or slides by other professors (earlier than her lectures).&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be helpful.

You can understand marketing from a different perspective.<br />There are some guest lectures, you can attend according to your own interest.

I love the TED talk she shared and the advertisements she played during the class. The comments and reflections of these videos helped me undertand and reflect a lot about life and of course marketing.<br />Experienced expert in the field of marketing.<br />I had attended her sharing to other mannagers of big companys before taking this course(Also the reason why I chose this course).<br />She always talked about her accent and sometimes couldn't pronounce 'that word' but I think it's fun and cute haha.",

This is more like the impression mark and is quite fair for a small class. <br /><br />The presentation is also important and easy, just follow the project guidelines and make sure you have nice groupmates. (I have very nice groupmates :) )<br /><br />To study for final quiz, you can check the last slides of the powerpoint which highlighted the main idea for each class.<br />Don't worry if you attend all lecture and be punctual. Prof would tell these students what would be the main questions in exam and what pages of textbook are important. And the quiz is very easy if you attend the leacture.<br /><br />Amazing grading. <br /><br />I think quite a number of students are in A range since Prof. Puig don't care about the curving during summer semester. She think if you deserve an A then you should have it.",

Basically, you will know&nbsp;&nbsp;how to do an analysis of consumer tension,3Cs, STP, 4Ps. <br />I think the topic about societal marketing is the most interesting and useful even if you are not a marketing-major student.",

The overall average (in my class anyway) is insanely high.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is quite heavy because it has frequent quizzes and you really need to revise the textbook for those. <br />The case analysis is relatively easy, just write about marketing strategy and comment on it (for me, it is the Beyonce business case).<br />The marketing plan requires more time and effort. But if you make good use of the in-class time that professor gave you to discuss and work it should be fine. <br /><br />Again, this course will require some of your spare time to get the three credits of marketing experiments.",

            "comment_teaching": "Coral is a very passionate teacher, and her classes are actually very interesting. She includes a lot of her own experiences and examples in her presentations, and she likes to repeat important concepts a lot in all of her lectures to make sure we remember. And it works quite well. The only thing is her accent: it is so heavy. So unless you are able to understand her Spanish accent, you will not have a good time (or good grade) in her class.",
            "comment_grading": "Coral's grading is very lenient, but it also depends a lot on whether she knows you exist. Attendance is not mandatory in her class, but your chances at getting a good final grade will increase greatly if she knows you on a first name basis. If you succeed in getting her to remember you, you will not only have a more favorable impression, she will call on you more in class so you get more chances to get participation points. So just attend and participate more in class. It really helps.",
            "comment_workload": "Coral doesn't assign any (mandatory) weekly or daily homework, so it's relatively chill (but the readings she puts on the syllabus are definitely helpful if you're interested in marketing and want to do well on the final exam). There are 2 short essays that need to be completed at some point throughout the semester, but as long as the topic is related to class content and your use of technical terms is correct, you're pretty much guaranteed to get full marks on those. The only things that need more effort required is the group project and the final exam.",

The Group Exercise and Individual Class Participation are quite subjective so I don't consider the grading system a fair one, as you get a higher score if Sophie remembers you.

I think I get a high score for parti. One very important reminder is that not only answering questions can get a score, but asking questions and speaking out your comments are also positively contributing to the class and could get scores according to the syllabus. <br /><br />In my opinion, the scores for group projects and quizzes are similar among all students. When graded by curve, what makes your score stand out would be the parti score as you can get 10 more scores than others if you speak up actively.<br /><br />The grading is super lenient.

The final project also consisted of a groupwork where your group would write up a marketing project for a company, and present it. However, the course did not nearly prepare us enough for the task, and in fact all the topics in the later ends of the course end up rushed, with the last few not even discussed more than 30 minutes each. Attendance is required and part of a grade, she also encourages you to speak up during class and be proactive as it gives u an extra +/- 10% grade on ur final mark.",
            "comment_teaching": "Unfocused teaching, Whilst Prof Kim has decent english and teaching skills, she only delves into the surface layer of material and expects you to dive in-depth on your own into the textbook, not to mention she always suddenly rants about psychology in the middle of the class that take up large amounts of time. Also, if you write to her with questions about any topic or question, she will not respond instead asking you to figure it out for yourself. Overrall, unsatisfactory performance. The TAs weren't really involved in teaching so nothing to say about them.",

I would say make sure to communicate with Coral, by which I mean talking to her after class or emailing her from time to time to update her about your progress and to get her opinions on your work. Coral is super generous about providing comments and is super nice to students who approach her.<br /><br />Class participation matters a lot in this class. Basically same as every other courses in ust that includes class participation in grading. Coral gives a lot of opportunities for people to answer and to earn their scores. It can be sometimes stressful speaking in front of the class, but whether you are a local student or not, the whole purpose of university education is to train you for workplace interaction. If you find speaking in a class where the teacher's duty is to help you learn unbearable, you might as well consider another career direction.",

The first set starts with identifying <br />consumer needs and ends with positioning a product or service to satisfy those needs and <br />differentiate it from competition. In between, there is rigorous analysis of the customer, the <br />competition, the environment, and the company’s own capabilities. The second set of activities <br />revolves around the “marketing mix”, commonly referred to as the 4 P’s (product, placement, price <br />and promotion). Marketing mix activities include letting the consumer know about the product in an <br />attention-getting, convincing and motivating way, getting it to the consumer through the best <br />combination of distribution channels, pricing it effectively, and offering incentives to try, purchase, <br />and re-purchase.",

Her English is good (although has a bit accent), and she delivers concept in a very clear way (e.g. give some real-life examples). Some in-class exercises really help to understand the concept. There are also consultation sessions for you to ask questions about your group project, and she will give you detailed comments. Before each quiz, she will provide revision sessions (very important).<br />Personally, I think she is one of the best professors I have ever met in UST!<br /><br />GRADING<br /><br />3 Quizzes (Best 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;25%<br />Final Project Report&nbsp;&nbsp;27%<br />Final Project Presentation&nbsp;&nbsp;15%<br />Group Exercise&nbsp;&nbsp;5%<br />Research Credit&nbsp;&nbsp;3%<br />Individual Class Participation +/-10%<br /><br />The grading is pretty fair, Personally, I get an A (Best 2 quizzes: 18/25, 20/25; Score of group project not released).<br /><br />It is easy to get full marks in research credit and group exercises. For the individual class participation, it is really important to attend and raise your hand in every lecture so that Sophie will remember your name, and this counts a lot to your final grade.<br /><br />Quizzes are not so difficult, they are all MC questions (will ask some questions about applying concepts in real world).<br />However, the options are quite ambiguous. Even after you finished the quizzes and check the notes, I will still not sure about your answer. As a result, no one get full marks in any of these quizzes. But if you pay attention in every lecture, you should have no problem with the quiz.<br />Since it is an online examination, it is close-book and pen is not allowed.<br /><br />WORKLOAD<br /><br />The workload is pretty low. There are no individual assignments. For the quizzes, if you pay attention in the lecture, it just cost you 1 day for revision (try to memorize all key concepts). The workload of group projects really depends on your teammate. But overall, the workload is still low for a 3 credit course.",

So it is quite flexible for you. For class participation, you need to be active and response to professor's questions during classes. This is not easy especially when you are in the 9am class. In terms of in-class activities, professor will usually announce when there is a in-class activities and remind people to join, so better not miss it. Academic research is quite chill as well, you just need to do a few survey then you can easily get all the bonus point. Just to reminded that to register ASAP when there is a new survey release so you don't have to worry about it anymore later in the semester. <br /><br />The mean is always super high and if you miss a few points, it is probably you will be below mean. You will want to spend more time to go through the extra assigned learning from professor to ensure a high/full mark in quizzes.

Sometimes he would like to talk about stories or jokes about himself, which I personally think are quite interesting. But he may teach a little fast from time to time, so it would be better if you can read the slides before class.<br />And I really think Prof. Wang is charming and has a lot to be learnt from in terms of personality. You can see passion, profession and intelligence on him.",
            "comment_grading": "Actually I was very worried at the begginning hearing about how Wenbo was a &quot;killer&quot;. But it turned out that my grade is better than I imagined, didn't drag down by GPA so much.<br />We only had two quizes this semester and the better one was counted. We didn't have the presentation and its weight was added to the written report.<br />Here are the statistics:<br />quizes: mean: 21/25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.5/25&nbsp;&nbsp;high: 25/25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24/25<br />mine: 21/25, 22/25&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The scores for report and participation were enclosed.<br />Research credit: 3/3<br />Final grade: B+ (Thank you Wenbo, I thought I might get a B- or C+)<br />I think the key to this course is to be proactive in class and make the professor remember you. Speak up as much as possible. If you aim at A range, I think answering or raising at least one question each class is a must. <br />Quiz and project are also very important. Plz remember to recite every examples in slides clearly and pay attention to the examples told in class as well. They would all be tested in quizes and could be confusing.<br />For the project, I personally think the professor put more importance on the logic than the creativity of idea. Your customer demand and market size should be strongly supported by data from research, instead of just &quot;blowing water&quot;. If you have time, it'd be a good idea to make an appointment with him in advance and ask him what he want from the report.",
            "comment_workload": "Light compared with other SBM courses.<br />You only need to review hard before quizes and prepare well for your project. We didn't do the presentation this semster because of the cancellation of face-to-face lecture, which is great haha:)",

The course follows a marketing framework which I am sure you will find on a lot of the other reviews here so I won't dive into it.<br />The content is not hard to understand as long as you put adequate effort into studying it before quizzes and the textbook isn't necessary to score well in quizzes (just the lecture notes will suffice).",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Wenbo is quite passionate for teaching especially&nbsp;&nbsp;this course considering that he has taught it for the past couple of years (his other courses are MBA courses). His expertise and long time teaching of this course has allowed him to build a course that facilitates open discussions and help foster students understanding instead of the Asian way of studying - memorization.<br />Professor Wenbo's teaching is also quite funny and for some reasons, in the examples he gives regarding real-life marketing, he often uses comedic examples which basically keeps you awake for the whole class.",

However, I think the overall grading system has been considerably fair and allowed for deserving students to thrive.<br />If you aren't that extroverted or generally is not that active in class, this professor may not be most suitable for you. Nonetheless, the sometimes excessive in-class participation could help you build up the confidence to speak in front of a group of people who are just there for the attendance grade.",

There is basically no homework throughout the semester, and the only workload comes from the 1 hour study-time before each quiz (total of three) and the short case studies that we are required to read*.<br />The final project could get a little hectic since its also due during the finals season and could get chaotic if you have bad group mates. With that said, as you can pick your own group, just make sure you pick one with minimal free-riders to get the work done.<br />*Considering how popular many of these case studies are, you can definitely Google them and find the key points that will aid your class discussions.",

What I think helps a lot is she gives +/- 10% for participation (i.e. it's not part of the official grade breakdown, but if you participated a lot, you can go up 10%).",

Plot twist: I ditched 5 of his lessons whole semester and had never arrived punctually (being late for 5-30 mins). School is not a place for smart people.<br /><br />Yeah maybe his grading is slightly worse than others but hey what are you in for. The knowledge or the gpa? He teaches you about marketing yourself in the last lesson (tho I skipped it), he teaches you how to be smarter, he teaches you practical skills in marketing, he teaches you lifelong attitude and provides you insightful advice. He is a good teacher but he doesn't give lenient grades to students. Maybe he just has a high expectations kept on us. So try your best in class and hope for the best! I like him.",

            "comment_grading": "Honestly, the reputation of him as a killer isn't really fair. In the first lesson, he actually showed that all marketing professors give almost the same % of As, Bs and Cs. As long as you pay attention to class and take a full day to study for quiz (normally I study the quiz on the day at 12pm and 1 hr for each chapter, that should be more than enough to do well in the quizzes). So choose professors according to what you can LEARN, and Wenbo is definitely one that you can learn a lot from.",

You have group discussions on these materials and he will ask you in the quiz the questions your group was assigned on to check that you are not a free-rider. But no in-depth questions.",

He likes to ask questions and expects free flow and interesting answers from students. He has a lot of interesting views towards marketing and business decisions.<br /><br />However, he does not include everything in his powerpoint, so make sure you copy what he says regarding business decisions in cases, as they may be covered during the quizzes.",

Group Exercise (10%)<br />5. Research Credit (3%), individual work<br />6. Individual Class Participation (10%), individual work<br /><br />The quiz covers class powerpoints, and sometimes questions on group exercises and group work to make sure no one is free riding.<br /><br />The group project is on a service or product that exists/not does exist. You need to talk about the 3Cs, 4Ps and STP, and also the marketing framework, expected implementation timeline, finances etc. So imagine you are a start-up doing pitches and that's what your project will need to include.<br /><br />Research credit stuff will be sent through email.<br /><br />Group exercises are on business cases from Harvard and other schools. A class will be dedicated to discussing the case (2-3 in total throughout the year) and answering assigned group questions.<br /><br />Individual class participation is not part of the 100% of the course grade. But you will get an extra + or - 10% (max) depending on how much you are of a positive/negative influence in class. So answer more questions and impress Wenbo with good answers, and don't doze off or chat in class as you could get marks deducted any time.<br /><br />I got almost full marks for all three of my quizzes and our group did okay during presentation and the report. I also did not speak up much during class. Finally got an A-range, even though I was expecting a B-range for not being active in class! I think the group presentation is extremely important, so get good groupmates.",

There are quizzes once in a while but it's okay as if you pay attention in class, quiz should be okay.<br /><br />Group project is tougher as Wenbo briefs the guidelines rather late (but I heard it's the same for every other class). And you have to start things from scratch. But there is sufficient time as long as you make group decisions quick (i.e. what service/product you are going to do), and don't make last minute changes.",

Project Report is a Marketing Plan that you make for a company, by analyzing the 3Cs, setting the STP, and formulating the 4Ps. When I took his class, it was about setting up marketing plan of a new restaurant for a particular restaurant group. This is done per group (5-6 people).<br /><br />3. Presentation is about presenting your final report/marketing plan. <br /><br />4. ORE is a observation exercise that is done usually by 2 people. Students are asked to observe consumers' behavior and activities, then just report what you observed and what insights you can provide. You can choose any consuming activity, up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Lastly, participating in the class will certainly be beneficial for you and gain you participation marks, you can ask questions or give out your ideas. He recognizes all of his students. And since people get high scores or score the same on quizzes, participation mark could give students another chance to increase their grades. <br /><br />Best 2 Quizzes : Total 50%<br />Final Project Report: 25%<br />Project Presentation: 10% <br />Observational Research Exercise: 10%<br />In-Class Group Exercises: 2%<br />Research Participation: 3%<br />Class Participation: +/- 5%",

It should be noted that the professor places heavy emphasis on participation, so it is important to take part in discussions, answer questions, be punctual, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation definitely made a big difference to the final grade, especially because the quizzes are not very difficult. A lack of participation may even result in grade deductions.",

As I think Marketing is a popular choice besides Finance and Accounting, many students registered for popular professors. As I was allocated to register classes at 3pm, this is almost the last option that I could get. The content covers almost the whole book for 10+ chapters. In my opinion, I do not think that you need to buy the book, as the previous versions are just similar to the latest one, except that the examples and design might be different. The publisher will have a new edition every year, but I think it's a total waste to buy a new book, as you can always borrow the older versions in the library.",

He said in the first lesson that as he knew that HKUST is famous for having bright students, he wanted to teach in HKUST to see the learning atmosphere here. He is very engaging, which I like it. During the first lesson, he asked everyone to introduce themselves. In the second lesson, he could already remember most of the names. The lessons lasted for 3 hours once a week with a break in between. I like this better as I can often endure long lessons. He often asked questions to students, especially those who didn't pay attention in class according to my observation.",

            "comment_grading": "I would say not good as I expected.<br /><br />In the course, you have 3-quiz and count the best 2 (All are in MCs format). <br /><br />Tips: For the second and third quiz, Wenbo will have 1 question about optional reading for bonus (which is absolute grading, independent for the quiz) and 1 question about group project (very easy as he just ask you to write down your project name to prove you are not freeride and know what your group is doing)<br /><br />I say bad grade because I got full mark for quiz one and above 1 sd for quiz 2. Quiz 3 result didn't announce. I get full make in research (You need to participate 3 research study). But I got B+ only. I guess the marks is very competitive and you need to answer questions in class, project mark may also affect your grade.",
            "comment_workload": "Not too much in the first half of the course, Wenbo does not have HWs and what you need is to spend some time to do revision for quiz (Only read his PPTs would give you good result). <br />However, you need to have marketing puzzles and marketing presentation after first half of the course (Two presentation and 1 final report). Yo may need some time to meet up with groupmates to discuss.",

However, the peer review marks DO affect your individual score (can bring it up or down) so don't free ride if you want a good grade.

In terms of the group project, you're allowed to form your own groups, so don't work with free-riders! The majority of the workload is from the Clocky case study and the Marketing Plan at the end of the semester, and to do a good job, you'll have to put in a lot of effort.

But remember, the answers are based on the assumptions Shi Yang set in class, so do not tend to over think!<br /><br />Marketing Puzzle: You have to hand in a 2 page report and prepare a simple presentation. Just find a simple topic and work on it. Our group finished the puzzle within 3 hrs.....<br /><br />Marketing Project; choose a service or product to promote it in HK. Do spend more time in the final project since it accounts quite a lot of marks.<br /><br />Research Participation: sign up for marketing research and spend 3 hours to finish 3 boring research......<br /><br />Class participation: Well, go to class",

Basically, you can't get much from this professor, maybe she will improve.<br /><br />First, her presentation has a large room for improvement, it is difficult for you to understand what she is talking about. She has strong mainland accent which makes her presentation even more difficult to understand. To be honest, only a few students will listen to her in class.<br /><br />Second, don't find her for consultation during the assigned timeslots(2 times theoughout the semester, 10 minutes each), she will confuse you and being confused by you, then she will keep agreeing with you, but I heard that turns out she was not satisfied by what she approved. Finding her after class or office hours makes more sense.<br /><br />However, she is quite willing to improve, obviously the lessons are easier for us to catch up and understand at the last stage of the course. <br /><br />One more thing, she tends to add some economics and mathematics knowledge in the course, which are not covered in other lectures.",

This is the most horrible part in the course. It is really hard to find a strategy that is easy to illustrate and can satisfy her fully. <br /><br />Lastly, the marketing project, she tends to give similar marks to all groups. One point to get a better grade: try to find special/new/luxury goods for your project.<br /><br />Our clocky case was just counted as inclass group exercise, however, some lectures counted these seperately and it takes up 1x% of the course grade for them.

I can pay more attention in her class than any other courses. <br />Kim is also very inspirational, when you seek for her comments on your project, she gives very concrete and useful comments and guide you to think deeper. You can really improve bit by bit through her comments.",

            "comment_workload": "All the MARK2120 course have similar workload, the project takes quite a lot of time and effort. For Kim, it is particularly important to attend every lesson as her quizzes heavily contented on her teaching materials only can be seen in class (ppt not completely uploaded), so you really can't skip lesson. However, if you pay attention in class, you don't have to revise much for the quzzes, so I guess it is still fair.",

Make sure you understand the question and each answer thoroughly.<br /><br />Sophie helped us by underlining some keywords and bold them, which helps in some sense, but in general... meh, some of the answers are still so ambiguous. Choosing one more option or one less would only grant you 0 marks. Also, make sure you watch/ attend all lessons of her class because many of the quizzes questions are from in-class discussions or points that are not typed in the slides.<br /><br />Expect a heavy workload towards the end of the semester, when you have to finish 10 pages of the business plan report (using the 3Cs, 4Ps, and stuff), as well as 15-20 minutes of presentation.
