        "description": "This course guides students to explore the causes, processes, and long impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution (CR) of 1966-76. As one of the most critical periods in Chinaâ€™s 20th century, such a massive sociopolitical upheaval and violence not only caused many deaths, dismantled the bureaucracy and crushed the economy, but also inspired radical politico-social movements in Hong Kong, Western Europe, Japan, North America and etc. Firsthand sources and accounts on the CR will be examined together with scholarly studies concerning the CR and the 20th century radicalism worldwide.",

            "comment_teaching": "The professor is knowledgeable in Cultural Revolution. <br />If you want to have a better understanding on Cultural Revolution or have a close reading on the required text, you have better listen to what the professor said.<br />If you missed his word, you better ask the people next to you or the TA , or you will find it hard to catch it up.<br />He is patient in giving advice to your work if you face any difficulty, he will kindly offer help to you.",

The assignment was too tough for me and I can barely finish it.",
