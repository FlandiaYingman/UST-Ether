        "description": "The public receives a lot of chemical information through mass media platforms (e.g. television, newspaper, social media, advertisements and productsâ€™ labelling), but occasionally these contain Chemistry depicted in a misleading or even pseudoscientific way. This experiential learning course aims to teach students to understand and apply the scientific method (observations, hypothesis, predictions, experiments, biases, etc.) through highly interactive lectures and a case study project based on a chosen social or daily life Chemistry topic from the mass media. Working in small groups, students will conduct both literature and experimental research on their chosen topic to evaluate its scientific claims and the public perception to them, under the instructor's supervision. Towards the end of the course, students will write up their findings into a scientific report for professional audience and construct a piece of science communication for laymen audience. Students should seek instructor's approval prior to enrollment in the course.",
