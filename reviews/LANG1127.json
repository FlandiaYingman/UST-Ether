            "comment_content": "If you can speak and understand Chinese fluently then this is a good course for you. HOWEVER, it can be difficult if your vocabulary is limited to basic conversational phrases.<br /><br />In this course, there is no dictation that counts to your grades, but you will be doing a presentation introducing a topic of your choice with a group you choose yourself . This is very useful if you want to expand your vocabulary in a certain area for future reference. Like if you choose your topic to be econ related, then as you do your research, you learn more vocab and maybe when you're done, you can talk like a pro regarding that topic. <br /><br />Then you do a final report on the topic you chose for the presentation. The final exam for this course is just typing out a report in class.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ms Liang is an amazing teacher who will answer any question you have with great enthusiasm. She makes sure to challenge every student and make the class engaging, which is my favorite part about the class. The learning environment is very chill so you always feel free to ask anything. You basically learn how to write a formal report",
            "comment_grading": "For the presentation, she gives a grade but part of it also comes from peer evaluation. Which is really good because then everyone in your group will work on it if they want a good grade so the overall workload between the group members are more balanced. She tries to make the grading as fair as possible.<br /><br />The standards for the class is actually quite high because there are a lot of experienced chinese speakers in the class. Most students are foreigners who lived in a Chinese speaking country for 10+ years so don't underestimate this class. From my experience, there is a wide gap in the capability of this class. Some are REALLY good in Chinese and you wonder why the hell are they in this foreigners class, and some are clearly worse than others and you wonder why they didn't just ask to drop to a lower class. Honestly, who knows. Maybe because you can type out the final report and not have to memorise characters?",
            "comment_workload": "In terms of workload, it is not a lot even though she always gives homework, it is up to you to decide how much you write. She always gives back the homework with suggestions and corrections on what you can work on and she encourages students to correct it and give it back to her for another look so that the student can improve their writing skills as much as they can through out the course. <br />The presentation is just preparing to speak for 3-4 minutes and she gives a lot of clear instructions and examples on how to do them so it is fairly straightforward.",

Submission of electronic/paper copy of the report is due on the very last class)<br />Week 12: oral presentation of your research findings, 4-5min per person (25% of final grade)<br />Week 13: reflection + peer evaluation, 1 hour (20%+10% of final grade)<br /><br />Overall the course content is bit disorganised and I was often confused by the guidelines on the course website which was frequently not accessible. The sample writings (past students' work) posted online sometimes were not in accord with the benchmark. <br /><br />Students can choose their research topic freely, but this also means the difficulty and the professor's expectation for the written report/oral presentation will be different depending on the chosen topic (so there is no set standard for everyone in class). <br /><br />Details of the course outline are included as an attachment below.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Liang is very friendly and enthusiastic about teaching. She always responds to questions and is willing to meet students after class if they have additional questions. I had appointments with professor Liang at the language center almost every week regarding the projects, and she was very helpful sometimes.",
            "comment_grading": "Everything except the reflection in the end consists of individual and group marks. Most overall marks are based on the group work, so getting diligent teammates is essential in order to excel in this language class. I was also told that the professor sets different expectations for different students depending on the level of their Chinese academic background.<br /><br />More than two unexcused absences will result in F. <br /><br />Grading was not transparent. What stressed me out the most was that according to the rubric, the grade boundaries between 7 (maximum score that can be achieved in each criteria), 6, 5, and 4 were very subtle, and the professor herself could not clearly explain the difference between an A and a B-.<br /><br />For reference, I got below 70% for the first oral presentation and performed more or less the same in the rest of the assignments. The grades for the second presentation and the final report were not released, but I still got an A (which was aberrant, I was expecting much worse) in the end for the overall grade. In terms of this, students seem to be graded with the lenient scale.",
            "comment_workload": "I could not study my major and other subjects in this semester especially after the mid-term period due to the heavy workload in LANG1127. This is primarily because I am a very slow learner in languages. <br /><br />By the end of each Saturday (prior to week 5-6), students are required to post their assigned homework (recordings, draft versions of written reports. These are not graded but most of them are related to the final project) online. Students also need to update their submitted assignments after the professor leaves comments on the work. Failure to submit these assignments will not affect the final grades but it means there is more work to do on your own later on.<br /><br /> If one does not use Chinese (Mandarin) outside of the class, particularly for an international student, preparations for the oral presentations and written reports can be very dull and time-consuming. So, if the student has never seriously studied Chinese before, he or she is suggested to take LANG 1126 or a lower level Chinese course.",
