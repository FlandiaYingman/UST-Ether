        "description": "This course introduces students to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) relevant to aerospace engineering. Students should be familiar with multivariate calculus and linear algebra, preferably with some experience with MATLAB or PYTHON. Topics include the governing equations of fluid flows, the use of applied mathematics to solve partial differential equations, and their implementation into a computational framework. Students will learn how to perform CFD simulations and post-process data to extract meaningful physics and insight for flows relevant to aerospace engineering. The course offers hands-on CFD laboratories focusing on laminar and turbulent, as well as steady and unsteady, flows over airfoils/wings. For minor (AE); or MECH and AE students in their third year of study or above.",
