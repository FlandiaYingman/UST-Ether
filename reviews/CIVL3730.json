Try to do good division of labour and you will get along with it. For the first 4 lab, workload is ok and you are able to do alone. However, for the last one, it is of very most difficult. The major problem comes to data processing. The data (ard 500 cells) are not given in excel format. Very annoy to input them one by one. <br /><br />If you have sufficient knowledge about excel, it will be easy to complete.",
