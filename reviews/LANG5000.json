The answers can be answered briefly in about 30 seconds.<br /><br />Example:<br />What are some of the most popular sports in your country/Hong Kong? (Possible follow-up: Do you play any of these?)<br /><br />In the second part, you are given a problem and you are asked to discuss it by speaking two minutes. Before answering, you have one minute prepare.<br /><br />Example:<br />In some countries the police are often as corrupt as the criminals. What are the solutions to this problem?<br />Follow Up<br />- Which is the best solution?<br />- Would most people agree with your solution? - Would your solution(s) work?<br /><br />Important here is not to question the problem itself, but to come up with possible solutions.",

To pass at least 4 out of 7 points need to be obtained in each of the following areas:<br /><br />Topic development and coherence:<br />You can speak for a long time and usually in a well-organised way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes when you hesitate, you seem to be searching for words or structures; at other times it seems quite natural.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You use a range of connectives, although you may make errors.<br />You may use too many fillers (e.g., ‘you know’, ‘like’).<br /><br />Vocabulary range and accuracy:<br />You use an adequate range of vocabulary to talk about a given topic. You might repeat words and phrases. You may quite often choose the wrong word or the wrong form of a word, especially if you are a risk-taker and like to try out new words and phrases, but this rarely affects other people’s understanding of your message.<br /><br />Grammar range and accuracy:<br />You use both simple structures and complex structures. You might repeat particular structures. You may quite often make mistakes, especially if you are a risk-taker and like to try out different structures, but this rarely&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affects other people’s understanding of your message.<br /><br />Pronunciation:<br />You pronounce most sounds and words correctly, and on the whole your pronunciation does not cause difficulties for the listener. You mostly use rhythm and intonation appropriately.<br /><br />The description below each area corresponds to requirements to achieve 4 points.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload depends strongly on your general level of English:<br /><br />I believe that for natives, and for non-natives who lived in an English speaking country there is little need to prepare.<br /><br />For intermediate English speakers I would recommend the following:<br /><br />Think of phrases to express you opinion (e. g. I believe, from my point of view, in my opinion) and a variety of words to link your sentences. Try to practice them beforehand such that you sound naturally.<br /><br />Practice the discussion of a problem. Use a timer to track your preparation time and your speaking time.",
