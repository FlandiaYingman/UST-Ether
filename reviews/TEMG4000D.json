        "description": "Speaking at the Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference in London, Barclays’ CEO Antony Jenkins warned the “banking sector has not yet felt the ‘full disruptive force’ of technology – but it will.” The goal of this course is to deepen student’s appreciation of disruptive technologies on banking through lecture, case studies and student teamwork. The course will provide a brief overview of the history of banking and money, an overview of the current global banking system, and then a survey on a variety of technologies such as Bitcoin, crowd funding, P2PL, and Alipay. The focus will be on “why” these technologies emerged and what problems they solve. Final project is for students, working in teams, to develop and present an innovative financial product or service targeted toward the college student customer segment. Enrollment in the project course requires approval of the course instructor.",

            "comment_content": "The course started with the notion of money and currency, then followed by a brief introduction of Bitcoin. In fact there weren't a lot of content about Bitcoin even though it was listed in the course title, simply because thoroughly explaining the technology would need another course. In the second week of the course, we went through a series of fintechs and have a taste of how the new disruptive trend goes. The content of the course is very rich and intense. You'll learn a lot if you pay attention, but at the same time it may be a bit demanding for amateurs.",
            "comment_teaching": "Tim was responsible for the framework of the class. He provided a lot of opportunities for interaction within the class. This significantly made the class more fun. Sufficient break time was given in the class so the 4-hour class in the morning was actually not as demanding as others may think.<br /> <br />Tim also invited a lot of guest speakers to give us insights on how technology works in the banking industry. The lectures are inspiring, and the speakers were very willing to answer questions raised by students.",
            "comment_grading": "The class is very small, yet Betty was still bound to the university policies, i.e. there was a set percentage for A's, B's and C's. The uncertainty is very large due to the small class size, so if you only care for the grades then this course is not for you.",
            "comment_workload": "This is a 3-credit course. Even though this class is fun and the workload is not as much as 3-credit courses in regular semesters, you can imagine what would happen if all the assignments are cramped inside 2 weeks. <br /><br />We had a question-to-think for the first 7 days. Since it was just for fun and Tim seriously didn't want us to write too much to avoid heavy workload, this was pretty easy. <br /><br />However, we had 2 projects within the course. The requirements were not really tough, but just like other TEMG courses, students joining this course strove for excellence. Everyone was working really hard on the projects, and this made the projects tough. <br /><br />Just as I said, this course is not for amateurs. Take it only if you really love it. At least I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />P.S. The course duration may be extended in future due to comments sent to the instructor. The workload density may drop in future.",
