        "description": "Fintech has become the hot buzzword in Hong Kong with Accenture, Citibank, DBS, Nest, and now Standard Chartered and Baidu creating financial technology accelerator programs in the city. The goal of this course is to deepen student’s understanding of our current financial market and the potential application of future financial technologies through guest lectures, case studies and student teamwork.  We will review the financial system as it operates today and then discuss a variety of technologies such as mobile payments, block chain technology, and P2PL. The focus will be on “why” these technologies are emerging and what problems they may solve. During the class we will look at a variety of local fintech companies to provide real life examples. This is a highly interactive course, where student assessment is a combination of contribution to class discussion, case studies and presentations. For students of the Dual Degree Program in Technology and Management and other IPO students, and students with consent from the course instructor only.",
