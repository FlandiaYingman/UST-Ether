So chill in the tutorial that he even told us to google and not answering questions about assignments. Feel hopeless if you really have trouble doing the exercises. Chill for him, hell for you.",

Assignment 1 is fine. (I got mean). <br />Assignment 2 is really a mess that you cannot get what you need through lecture notes. You need to GitHub and StackOverflow a lot, but there are restrictions that you cannot use materials outside the lecture. So, it is so hard to finish, and it takes a lot of time even you can do it. (I only managed to finish 80% and get around 70/100)<br /><br />Final exam: 40% [didn't release score]<br />2 hours for 4 coding tasks. Even more difficult than assignments and you wouldn't be able to finish on time. As a python beginner, even I study hard and attend all lectures, I can only finish about half of the exam. The expression of question is messy and hard to understand what's happening. And some of the finished parts have errors that are not taught how to solve. Feel so frustrated and expected to get about 25-30/100 for the exam.<br /><br />Heard that mean is around B-, expect to have C&nbsp;&nbsp;or C- in my situation. [**UPDATED: Surprisingly, the grade is not extremely bad. Finally got a C+ and it's better than my expectation.**] Really not recommend for python beginners as there is not much you can learn from the lectures and you will be suffered from a bad grade and frustration when dealing with assignments and final. If you are eager to learn python, there are many online courses that work way better than this.",

Maybe the experienced feel better that there is no group exercise or project.",

He is not wrong but he has got no content for teaching about different functions, attributes those kind of things. The way you learn for the content is just self learning through looking at the example code files and browse the internet. Very unclear instructions about the content that he change it from time to time. Very hard time to follow",
            "comment_teaching": "Very boring and not fun. Just listening to a robot speaking. Just reading through the slides. Because he may realize that his course is really boring, he will put the quiz at the last of the lecture to force you listen to lecture which make you very annoyed.",
            "comment_grading": "Again very unclear instructions. finish the basic requirements of solving the problem stated is a must, he also wants additional things such as user-friendliness, ease to read which is still reasonable. But when comes to presenting your own program for the assignment, he will tell you to make interesting video which need you the edit or add effects on it which is very time consuming and totally not related to any learning outcomes in this course.<br />The inclass exercise is also terrible, he has no time management at all that he only give very tight time for you to finish your work and it is quite time consuming to zip the file and submit to canvas so you dont have much time left or you will be late submission if you aim for fulfilling all task requirement and test them.<br />He also made tonnes of mistakes in the question files which is very confusing and he only give for 1 or 2 mins for you to amend the whole file becuz of his mistakes which is totally not enough.",
            "comment_workload": "Annoying workload but from time to time you have test for your own program for your assignment so it will take your time at a regular frequency but not only once before each deadline. He didn't read your assignment clearly so you will usually get a worse grade than you think. Even if you try to appeal it, he shows you a very non willing attitude on trying to regrade it again",

Jiajia only uses Jupyter Notebook to teach codes step by step, which can hardly give a full picture about 'Business Analytics'. Sure you can learn about coding skills, but don't expect to learn how to make your coding skills applicable.<br /><br />Prof James uses VS Code, and his individual project sounds more meaningful (although he has other annoying problems lmao). Jiajia's individual assignment is just some random coding questions for you to solve.<br /><br />Less and less students show up in Zoom lectures lmao. But it's no surprise as Jiajia just talk through the codes step by step. Attend the lectures if you don't understand the codes. Otherwise, you can just finish the lecture by yourself by reading through the codes within 30 mins lol.",

Some questions are challenging, but you can browse Stack Overflow and just finish the exercises step by step. I got ~38% out of the 40% in total for 5 In-class exercises.<br /><br />Individual Assignment (30%):<br />It's like an advanced version of the In-class exercises, included most of the topics you learnt throughout the semester. Again, just use Stack Overflow lol.<br /><br />Final Exam (30%):<br />Super difficult. Total GG. The mean was just 3X%. Luckily, I scored above mean by quite a lot. <br /><br />I really have to emphasize that relying only on course materials is absolutely NOT ENOUGH to get a good grade (unless you are a programming genius). I had an A at last. But I went online and did coding exercises very frequently. The course materials can only get you to learn the basics and some random examples.<br /><br />My only advice is keep doing exercises online",

You need to do a lot of practices and exercises. If you are a genius, you may find this course easy. No attendance, no participation, just 5 in-class exercises to be submitted within two days, and an assignment with adequate time to finish.<br /><br />But if you are stupid in programming like me, you definitely need more regular practices. Jiajia has some practice questions for each topic, but those are definitely not enough if you want to have a good grade in this course. Only relying on course materials may get you a low B or C range. <br /><br />Hard work definitely pays off in this course, especially in doing Jiajia's questions. You can find all sorts of exercises online. Do as much as you can and you should find Jiajia's questions easy.",

            "comment_content": "Disclaimer: This post has nothing to go against genetic disorders, but can't find other words to describe due to my poor expression skills<br /><br />Retarded course<br />Retarded TA<br />Retarded professor<br />Retarded assignments <br />Retarded exercises<br /><br />This course is basically shit, teaching useless content which is extremely basic. the course called is helping students build good programming practices but turns out to be wasting time doing useless shit. You won't learn &quot;Business Applications Development&quot; after the course, I'll say it is way far from developing stuff.<br /><br />3 modules:<br />Basic Python including class and dictionaries<br />Selenium<br />Flask",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is boring with many bullshits, teaching no useful practical content. Asking you to google everything.<br /><br />I rage quit the lectures after the first class, don't want to hear his retarded voice. They didn't even cover all the techniques in the course materials, so if you want a good grade you must attend the classes or go through the recordings.<br /><br />The TA and professor are extremely unhelpful, they will reply to inquiries with no manners, no matter in person or through email. And this nigga will reply to inquiry emails asking you to do the SFQ shamelessly, <br /><br />Sadly this retarded professor teaches a lot of IS courses, please avoid this mf if possible.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading simply depends on the moods of the professor and TA, sometimes getting full marks with a shitty program, but in some cases, using the same shit will cause point deductions. And you won't score high if you use your own methods to achieve the tasks. You have no say in discussing whether it's a good program or not with them.<br /><br />Overall &gt;80% but getting a B-, saw previous reviews saying getting B+ at the same overall score.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is light if you have learned basic python before.<br />The group project is s meaningless as it's difficult to collab and build a program at this stage. and you have to record a presentation of the program, which makes the course even worse.<br /><br />You have to learn intermediate HTML to score high in group projects, so I think that's why they changed the course name from python for business to business applications development. What's the point of using HTML from python?",

You will definitely not regret.<br /><br />&quot;Python has recently become the most popular general-purpose programming language according to many polls among programmers. The scripting nature of Python allows fast development and easy maintenance of applications. More importantly, the unparalleled community support makes Python increasingly powerful. In this course, students will learn Python programming language in the context of business data analytics. With the explosion of electronic data available to organizations and the demand for better and faster decisions, data-driven intelligence becomes a key source of competitive advantage for business organizations.

Students have one (sometimes two) days to finish. Assignments are not difficult, could finish in 1-2 days. And if you have taken his R course, you may find the selenium questions very easy. Since the questions are the same as R's exercises, just an easier and shorter version. This time, prof. gave a lot of restrictions, including only 2 submission attempts, using only what you taught (exclude the optional parts of the lecture notes) on the lesson.<br /><br />The exam is awful in terms of the time limit and the difficulty. 2 hours for 1 SQ and 3 LQ, the purposes of the programs students need to code are easy to understand. But it takes a very long time to process the instructions and follow the flow stated by the questions. Also, unlike the assignment, the question using selenium is much more difficult as it requires additional handling about some conditions which you have never seen in lecture notes or assignments before. After the exam, I took around 3-4 hours to finish the whole exam with all expected output met.",

Also, there are a lot of restrictions during the exam (i.e cannot use google colab, only Jupyter is allowed, cannot use Python set) So you are suggested to grab all the possible point in the in class exercises and assignments. <br /><br />As I just finished my final today, I will update grading leniency after receiving my grade.

You just need to spend an hour at most to finish the remaining questions, or you can simply work with your friends as he encourages you to do so. However, Jia jia will not give you any tips for the individual assessment, you are expected to work on your own this time . Do not try to copy your friends' work as it might result in plagiarism. For your information, I spent like a week on it and you have three weeks to work on it, you have more than enough time and Google could help you a lot. For final exam, just do the extra questions the night before and make cheat sheets for the codes that you are not familiar with and you'll be fine.
