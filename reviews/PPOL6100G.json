How results orientation is emphazized at ADB in achieving better quality projects and programs? And how institutional reforms take place at MDBs such as ADB which ensure improved staff resource reallocation and skills-mix changes in meeting evolving operational needs with efficiency and effectiveness? Specific cases will also be discussed to enhance professional skills valued at MDBs. This course combines lectures, case studies, industry expert guest speakers, and project work to involve students to deal with projects with real social impacts. Guest speakers (former and current Management of ADB) will be invited to share their perspectives with students.
