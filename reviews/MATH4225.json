            "comment_content": "Main textbook: The instructor's notes which has been published and sold online. A similar textbook is Munkre's topology textbook. <br /><br />For the part with point-set topology, I recommend Folland's real analysis or Rudin's functional analysis more, since one purpose of learning abstract point set topology for analysis is for the study of topological vector space and weak topology. <br /><br />Since my knowledge regarding algebraic topology does not exceed Yan Min's notes, I am not able to recommend other textbooks...<br /><br />Prerequisites:<br /><br />1. Maturity on analysis (In real analysis, the &quot;usual topology&quot; in R^n is discussed. Sometimes in probability theory, the topology induced by metric or sup norm may be discussed. With these workable experience, it is easier to understand the general point set topology as examples.<br />2. A good geometric intuition: In algebraic topology, the requirement for understanding the content is much higher. <br />3. Functional analysis: If you learn functional analysis before general point set topology, then the concept of topological basis is more understandable. But if you learn point set topology first, then you will accept the concept of weak topology much easier. <br /><br />Course content: <br /><br />-&gt; In overall, the course has the following purposes:<br />(i). Generalization: Generalize the concept of &quot;usual topology&quot; we are familiar with in Euclidean space. A topology can be induced by metric, topological basis, or even a set. <br />(ii). Classification: Some examples are to classify nonplanar graphs, or surfaces (using Euler's characteristics)<br /><br />1. Point-set topology <br /><br />-&gt; Metric space<br />-&gt; Topological basis and construction of topology<br />-&gt; Open/closed sets, closure<br />-&gt; Continuity, homeomorphism, product/quotient topolgoy<br />-&gt; Advanced topological concepts: Separation axioms, connectedness and path-connectedness, compactness<br /><br />2. Algebraic topology<br /><br />-&gt; Graph theory<br />-&gt; Simplex (generalization of triangles)<br />-&gt; Simplicial complex<br />-&gt; CW-complex <br />-&gt; Euler number<br />-&gt; Manifold, surface, classification of surface",

This is one of the few good points for Yan Min's exam. But Yan Min's exam questions are often tricky, so think twice before registering the course.",

            "comment_content": "As a pure math class, expect to do just about nothing but proving. Prof Yan's notes split the module into seven parts, which he describes in Canvas and in his own notes, so I will give you an *informal* description of these parts instead:<br /><br />1. Metric Spaces. This really is the most basic of content from Mathematical Analysis. Different types of metrics, as well as functions defined by metrics, are introduced. Expect the midterms to mainly work with functions defined by metrics, instead of just a question about regurgitating a metric's definition and properties.<br />2. Graph and Network. This is the chapter on Graph Theory, with an emphasis on identifying (i.e. eyeballing it without proof) and proving if a graph is one-trip or not, and whether it can be easily changed into a one-trip graph.<br />3. Topology: From here on forth, the use of metrics is discarded in favour of using open balls to redefine prior concepts. This is where difficulty jumps up massively.<br />4. Topological Concepts: Continuity, subspace, product space, quotient space.<br />5. Complex: Here you learn about triangulation, simplicial complexes, and CW complexes. For example, learning how to find the Euler number of a space, checking if a given triangulation can result in multiple shapes of interest, etc.<br />6. Topological properties: What it means when we talk about Hausdorff, connected, or compact spaces and surfaces.<br />7. Surface: Complete classification of surfaces.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Yan is very committed to his teaching, and will go in-depth in his classes, and recordings of his classes are available. As a person, he is appreciative of the students' interest and efforts, and will be reasonable to your questions or requests. For example, he will consider the needs of every individual student's schedules, when deciding when exactly to schedule the midterms. He also focuses heavily on whether you know to apply concepts -- to the extent that his midterms are 3 hours long, so that you are truly tested on your abilities rather than having to worry about rushing for time.<br /><br />He will respond to your emails asking for help too, but the examples he responds with might not be totally relevant (or might be too difficult for someone who's in a position to be asking for help in the first place lol)... But, the blunt and short TLDR is, &quot;no reasons to be upset with the teaching.&quot;",
            "comment_grading": "Homework 20%, Midterms 30%, Finals 50%. <br />Considering the heavy workload posed by the homework, I wish the 20% figure could have been higher.",
            "comment_workload": "Unless you enter this class already knowing all the content, the homework is... intense. For example, for my batch, we received 16 questions on Week 2, and if you want to do every single question seriously, it will be a massive time investment, as one might expect from a pure mathematics class. (But most pure mathematics classes don't ask for 16 proofs weekly, either!) Continuing the example, most proofs in Week 2 (this corresponds to chapter 1 -- Metric) took me 3/4 of an A4 page to hand-write out. Not every week will have the same number of homework problems, but don't expect more than 10% of the homework to be &quot;trivial&quot; like what one of the other reviewers wrote, unless you already came into this class knowing its content (more on that later) or unless you're highly confident in your learning speed.<br /><br />But, yes, anyways, metric and topological spaces are an overwhelmingly difficult discipline, so expect to really, really suffer and spend a lot of time for the 20% homework. Fortunately, the TAs do not mark every question strictly -- only 3 are chosen for strict marking, and you'll get full marks for the rest as long as they are reasonably attempted. So, don't give up totally and miss out on your submissions; it's worth it to at least try.<br /><br />Do note also that just doing the homework alone will definitely NOT be enough to stand up to the harsh difficulty of the exams, so this E grade I gave for workload in this review takes into account that you're going to have to do MUCH more self-study -- on top of the already-massive mandatory homework workload -- if you want to do better than, well, fail the exams. Please mentally prepare accordingly; it would be a good idea to self-study the content before coming into this class, especially if acing this class is a strong concern of yours. It would also be wise to revise your mathematical analysis concepts, such as, for example, the definitions of a set being open, how to prove compactness in sets, the meaning of uniform convergence, etc. This is a very very difficult class for a very very intense and intriguing discipline -- all the best!",
