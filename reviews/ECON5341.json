Macroprudential and macroprudential approaches to regulating financial institutions and systems.<br />3. Causes and consequences of inflation and hyperinflations. The return of inflation since early-2021.<br />4. Classical approaches to conducting “conventional” monetary policy.<br />5. Breakdown of conventional monetary policy frameworks. Forms of “unconventional” monetary policy.<br />6. Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Fintech, big tech, and cybersecurity challenges to payment systems and to the design and conduct of central banking. Wholesale and retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).<br />7. The role of forecasting in the conduct of monetary policy.<br />8. International and multilateral aspects of central banking.<br /><br />*I guess it is very useful if you want to work in big institutions/economists/central banks.<br />**Only very title quantitative or numerical content is involved.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor: Mico Loretan<br /><br />From the CV of the professor, you could understand that the professor has a very strong background and experience in Economics. He has written several interesting research papers. He has worked in different big financial institutions before. He is now the Economics advisor at the swiss national bank. You can expect he is more than enough to teach you and tell you many stories in the lesson. Professor is also responsive and willing to reply to your questions by email.<br /><br />However, in terms of teaching, I found that his teaching is not really good. He speaks in a relatively flat tone and cares less for online students. I tried to attend classes online for the first half lesson but I found that the professor did not share the sound and screen clearly. He also seldom responds to questions on Zoom. But this contradicts the &quot;hybrid setting&quot; of this course. As a student having a winter internship in NA, I feel the teaching and lecture discussion are not accessible. But I think the lecture notes are great though. Reading the lecture notes is already enough for you to understand the content. But if you are in Hong Kong, then I strongly suggest you attend the real-time lectures to understand what other think during the discussion.",
            "comment_grading": "Exact assessment rubrics from Canvas:<br />&quot;Grades will be based primarily on students’ performance in the take-home final exam, be completed following the end of the course. The final exam will consist of writing two essays – students select the essay topics from a list of four topics – that address and analyze economic statements related to monetary policymaking and central banking. Above-average oral participation during the lectures will also positively affect students’ grades.&quot;<br /><br />From the above, you can see that the assessment guideline is very unclear and not transparent. There are even no exact figures of how much the exam and participation are counted towards the final grade. Even after the release of the final grade, this is no comment/score released on either the participation score or the final exam score.<br /><br />Final exam: Unknown<br />Participation: Unknown (I did not participate in any class)<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />I guess the primary/only assessment is the final exam? I suggest you write the final essay like an &quot;Economist&quot;. Try to avoid &quot;blowing water&quot;. You should use research papers or economic equations/theories to support your stance.",
            "comment_workload": "The only workload is the take-home final exam. You need to complete the essay in 48 hours. You can choose two essay questions out of four. I personally spent around 7 hours reading the lecture notes and 12 hours to wrote around 5 pages. The workload is very light.",
