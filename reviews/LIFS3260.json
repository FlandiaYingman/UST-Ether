He won't tell you the answer straight away but he will slowly lead you to the answer. <br /><br />He would also demonstrate the entire lab once before we actually perform it ourselves. <br /><br />It is a pretty small class with only 20 studetnts, so we have more chances to practice and gain much hand-on experience. He also gave us much chances and time to do the practical skills.",
            "comment_grading": "It was an absolute grading. For me, I got 85%, which is A. You can do the calculation of how grades are calculated. <br /><br />Getting an A is not hard but you really have to be hard working. There are 4 reports in total. You have to write in details in order to get 90 percent. I wrote around 20 pages for each lab report. <br /><br />You dun have to think about what to write because all the questions are listed in the lab manual. All you have to do is answer them all with details and reference. <br /><br />As for the exam, it is pretty much the results of the labs. If you have done the reports with heart, it would be easy. It would be much better if you took microbiology at the same time because most contents are overlapped.",
