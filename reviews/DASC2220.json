        "description": "The course is designed for students who are new to data science and provides them with a basic training of probability and statistics. Some ideas and principles of data analytics with probability and statistics are covered. In addition to the knowledge of data, students will learn some data analytical skills and have hands-on experience of processing and analyzing real datasets by using a software like R or Python.",

            "comment_content": "If this course is not required, don't reg this course. Basically, he teaches nearly nothing. He just asks us to self-study or read the book he recommended for any related knowledge. I nearly learn nothing about statistics and probability in this course. Most of the time he just asks about the process of our project, not teaching at all.",
            "comment_teaching": "You are suggested to ask him directly if you have any questions. Self-motivation and self learn is important for this course. <br />Even though our course uses Python frequently, he teaches nothing about coding too. <br />It is like you ask when you don't understand something, more than he really has a teaching plan to teach us something.",
            "comment_grading": "60% Individual final project<br />20% Individual mini project<br />20% Participation<br />The grading is a mystery, we didn't receive any score or grading for each project. We only have the final grade for this course. He will give us feedback on every project but you won't know the exact score.<br />The rubrics of the assignment are really useless, you will never know what he wants for your project(⊙ˍ⊙)",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is really low, he always allows us to do the project in class. The only thing that I don't like about it is we have to collect our own data for the final project, even if there is existing data, you are still required to collect a new set of data. Raw data is required. I think the only workload is really the data collection part, others are just a piece of cake, and wouldn't require for a long time if you do them in class.",
