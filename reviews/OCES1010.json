He teaches biology, and I think I can learn the contents easily even though I didn't study biology in high school.<br /><br />For Prof. ZHANG, I think she can keep the class's attention just by her voice. The contents are also easy and less controversial (aka boring).

            "comment_content": "The content isn't necessarily hard, it's just very confusing and convoluted, and it is clear that the 4 professors did not properly consult with each other when creating the course curriculum.

One day the course covers the 4 layers of the atmosphere, the other day the course discusses different methods to identify microplastic fragments. <br /><br />Rough timeline:<br />Evolution, biological fitness, genetics<br />Human influences on environment<br />Food security and nutrition<br />Environmental health and toxicology<br />Water and Air pollution<br />Energy methods<br />Solid Waste and Microplastics<br /><br />These topics absolutely should not be taught in the same course, especially one that was allocated as a Year 1 SSCI foundation course. <br /><br />For the 3 people who want to declare an OCES major, some of these topics may be valuable to your understanding, especially He's section. Otherwise it's &quot;useless&quot;.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching styles varies greatly every few lectures because 4 professors teach this course. The actual judgement of the quality of the lecturer's teachings really depends on each person's individual opinion for this course, so here's mine. Generally, I don't really have an exceptionally good opinion for any of the professor's teaching; it was mediocre at best and confusing and unnecessary at worst. <br /><br />Wu (Teaches 33% of the course): Wu covers evolution, genetics, and general biology. Think IB Biology Topics 4 and 5. Wu was by far the best professor during this course; he would explain the content clearly while GIVING EXAMPLES(only lecturer that really &quot;taught&quot; the concepts) while inserting recap slides before each new lecture to remind people of the previous content taught. <br /><br />Zhang (Teaches 17% of the course): Zhang covers toxic chemicals, different diseases, environmental health, and relations between food production/supply and environment. Her lectures comprise of generic teaching of content that is way harder than anything Wu taught, and the way she delivers this content is just so boring and uninspiring. She just reads her monitor for 1.5 hours and calls it a day. The good thing about her lectures is that her slides literally cover EVERYTHING she talked about in class, so you don't even need to rewatch her lecture videos to understand her portion of the content. <br /><br />Li (Teaches 27% of the course): Li covers the atmosphere structure and air pollution, water supply, groundwater, water pollution and remediation. Her teaching was fine; she would also put recap of previous lectures at the beginning of each new lecture to allow students to brush up on content<br /><br />He (Teaches 23% of the course): What the hell, his teaching and the content he taught were an absolute train wreck. He starts off relatively normal with energy methods but then covers oddly specific and convoluted content like solid waste management, microplastic supply and accumulation, and marine environment protection. No, we do NOT want to listen for hours on what your colleague did in Zhejiang, we want you to TEACH THE CLASS. He also chooses content that are far more difficult than the other professors. He also only recites his lecture slides, and he would often skip entire slides or sections because his powerpoints are so long; they are also a nightmare to read through and go over because of how disorganized they were; full of random information that never appeared in the final exam (no joke an entire portion of his oceanography lecture was about James Cameron driving a submarine). As the course coordinator, He's teaching and content that he selected was ironically, by far, the worst. Good luck revising his lectures. By the way, the Kurzgesagt and DW documentary videos he listed as &quot;additional resources&quot; at the end of his lectures taught me more about the content than the lectures itself. SMH, absolute disaster. <br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't call any of the 4 professors &quot;fascinating&quot; to attend their lectures, maybe Wu was above average but there is definitely room for improvement",
            "comment_grading": "At least this super boring course has a very generous grading system<br /><br />30% midterms<br />30% finals<br />40% in-class participation/attendance (yes it's true, for a SSCI foundation course)<br /><br />Midterms and finals comprise of multiple choice questions(both single and multiple choice answers) as a couple of short answer/mini-essay questions. Nothing too complicated. <br /><br />Midterms and finals are pretty much even in terms of weight, and given that midterms were much easier than finals, the grading system for this course is good. <br /><br />My scores:<br />Midterm: 35/40<br />Final: Unknown<br />Grade: A+",

You’ll have time; they give you 3 whole hours for finals and most were gone by hour 2",
