        "description": "This is the laboratory course designed for students who enrolled in CHEM 2110 and CHEM 2111. Students will perform a series of organic experiments related to the theory learnt in courses. Students will be trained to perform a wide range of basic organic laboratory techniques, operate chemical instruments in laboratory, relate the physical and chemical principles and theory in practice and develop their data interpretation and analyzing skills. Experiments of topics such as esterification and Williamson ether synthesis will be included. For students in the programs under the four-year degree that designate the course as a required course/specified elective.",

If you failed to do so, in all likelihood you would be confused with the complicated steps and ended up leaving the lab late. 隨緣 for those long questions in lab reports. You are not going to get full score anyway, not matter how hard you try and how much you write. <br /><br />For the final exam, remember to recite all the materials cover in the lecture videos. If possible, read through the recommended reference books as well. In theory these preparations take you ~2 days to do so.",
