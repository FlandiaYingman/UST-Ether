            "comment_content": "** Syllabus Change After 2021 Fall **<br /><br />第二個macro course，老實講我唔太鍾意個content，佢係3123嘅extension，即係加野落ISLM同release一啲assumptions。但係佢好似好多野都好夾硬嚟，讀完如果有人問你點睇香港未來嘅經濟，你就可以答：唔知架，睇下啲人點expect個government同central bank做野囉，或者要加啲好strong嘅assumptions落去。同埋可能我本身麻麻地macro，所以我係極認同啲人話咩macro姐係A+B=C，所以C-A=B，對我嚟講好似無咩有趣嘅地方。但個course overall嚟講唔算難，亦唔算多野，只係兩個新model only，仲要互不相關，係要熟啲野only。<br /><br />數學嚟講好似反而無3123咁多algebra，重點嘅位反而係個concept同埋某個variable會點樣郁條ISLM之類。唯一重數嘅位就係講expectation augmented ISLM嘅時候會用utility maximization去做microfoundation推個新consumption function出嚟，所以可能會用少少3113嘅知識，但其實都只係普通mul cal，唔使太擔心。反而呢個course考試同功課都係寫字多。至於洗唔洗讀完3113先讀呢個course就見仁見智啦，佢就唔係佔好多架姐。但係3123嘅野就要記清楚啲ISLMPC同solow model都會無啦啦出現返。<br /><br />Course content:<br />1. Expectation augmented ISLM （擺埋uncertainty同expectation落去個model做analysis)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1. Financial market and expectation （講expectation點樣影響stock price/bond price嗰啲，如果熟finance會好啲）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2. Expectation, consumption and investment (用expectation重新寫C同I個function form，要用少少3113嘅野）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3. Expectation, output and policy （全部野放返落ISLM到，佢會話個expectation即係medium run同long run outcome，要用ISLMPC同solow predict個outcome再放返落short run ISLM到，極麻煩）<br /><br />--------------------midterm----------------------<br /><br />2. Exchange rate and open economy (另一個model，學同前面一啲關係都無，考試都係non-cumulative）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Openness in goods and financial markets (基本上就係放返export同import入去，同埋講下Balance of Payment，讀過DSE應該完全無難度）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. Goods market in an open economy （擺返落Y=Z到，同埋加埋NX curve去做analysis，好鍾意問咩policy mix可以back to potential output又improve trade balance）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. Output, the interest rates, the exchange rate in the short run （擺埋exchange rate落去，記住UIRP condition就完咗了，我懷疑因為我地assume LM 打橫，所以呢part極奇怪）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4. Exchange rate regimes （講下fixed exchange rate個trillemma同fixed同floating各有咩好壞）<br /><br />3. Back to policy (時代革命所以成個cut咗）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. Fiscal policy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2. Monetary policy",
            "comment_teaching": "Jenny絕對好過Lu Yang，at least佢真係識啲野，但都只係普普通通，佢每堂都係會用powerpoint啦，同埋都用visualizer喺紙上面寫啲notes，同埋microfoundation嗰part textbook係無嘅，一定要聽佢講。overall嚟講無咩同學生交流，咁好似同佢開sem嗰時堅持要小班個原意有啲唔同。英文都唔算差，有好少少accent，但唔影響聽。另外個course有個幾大嘅問題就係你可以明晒佢上堂講嘅野但係唔識考試，因為佢啲題目都幾多ambiguity，題題個答案都好似係uncertain咁，所以midterm前有極多人衝上去問佢姐係點答，佢好似講到好唔耐煩，叫我地盡量寫，有得吹就吹（其實都真係要咁）。<br /><br />tutor係astor，佢其實個教學質素都幾參差，去到一定要多啲math嘅topic佢好似就唔係好掂，但普通一啲conceptual嘅野佢反而講得唔錯，有時都會同我地吹下水，又會教下我地點考試點去做份project，好過佢3123嗰陣，不過第一堂同3123第一堂係一模一樣- -又撳啲data網。",
            "comment_grading": "我估佢都會係比較靚grade，唔會太差。但未出grade就純文字討論住，應該2月中先會出grade，而可能大家都諗緊下個sem會唔會reg呢個course，就寫住先。啲考試同埋problem set個設計基本上係一模一樣，又係True False with explanation，short questions，math questions，essay咁樣落去。<br /><br />Grading System:<br />Problem sets 18%<br />Midterm exam 30%<br />Group Project 10.5%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Report (8%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentation (2%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer evaluation (0.5%)<br />Final exam 40%<br />Class participation 1.5% (係個謎，無人知佢點俾分）<br /><br />Grading System (時代革命版，揀高分啲嗰個scheme）：<br />Problem sets 18%<br />Midterm exam 30%<br />Group Project 20.5%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Report (16%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentation (4%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer evaluation (0.5%)<br />Final exam 30%<br />Class participation 1.5%",
            "comment_workload": "好重workload下個course。佢啲problem set就3份，以一個sem得三份啲講，其實每份你話長又唔係真係好長。但係每題你都要時間諗，而且要寫一抽幾長下嘅答案去答。但好就好在astor淨係會抽幾題出嚟改，跟住由100分開始扣起，錯晒都分分鐘有九十幾分。<br /><br />Exam就non-cumulative，所以相對地係比較輕鬆，唔使用咁多時間去溫，但真係要熟每個detail位，佢係會考到幾detail下。<br /><br />Project就6-7個人一組，跟住佢俾10個topic大家去搶。但佢個topic極闊，例如咩internationalization of RMB，可能大家要做就要focus返喺background同埋啲Policy阿之類，同埋用返啲model同real data support啲effect of policy/ financial crisis。佢話就話要交咩reading同埋要用regression去做data analysis，但我個人覺得有啲太多，大家當寫篇野做個introduction其實就得，當然你aim high可以搵個啱嘅methodology去做analysis，做之前問下Jenny咁樣o唔ok。 sem尾就要搵兩條友去present 20分鐘同交一篇3000字左右嘅paper。如果無人freeride都唔算太難嘅，但sem尾會幾大壓力。",

            "comment_content": "The Econ department has launched a revamped version of 31X3 series in these semesters, and from Spring 21-22 on, Econ3143 will use the new syllabus, the open economy part will be in Econ3123 while Econ3143 will teach something new.<br /><br />That's what the professor told us in the first class, while this class was originally teaching expectation, open economy and exchange rates. <br />Thanks to the miscommunication between Prof Ge Zhi Gang and the dept in the previous semester, Econ3123 in Spring 20-21 was mistakenly changed to the new syllabus. Meaning that 60% of the class now actually already learn two-third of the materials in 3143. Therefore, Professor decide to switch to the new syllabus in this semester.<br /><br />Part 1: Including expectation in IS-LM model<br />This part is of the Blanchard textbook.<br /><br />Ch14: Financial Market and Expectations<br />Present value, Future value, Interest rate; Bond price and bond yield, negative yield; Stock price<br />You should learn them in your finance course before, not a big deal.<br /><br />Ch15: Expectation on Consumption and Investment<br />How does current consumption and investment change against change of expectation.<br />The professor introduce a 2 period inter-temporal consumption problem which is taught in Econ3113, she explains everything in a relative fast pace so don't forget your 3113 stuff. She often use Lagrange Multiplier method to solve the problems.<br /><br />Ch16: Expectation, Output, Policy<br />Merging the finding in Ch15 into IS-LM model, development a new model to analyses different shocks to the economy. At this point it is very like what is in Econ3123 and should be relatively easy.<br /><br />---Midterm---<br />---Blanchard Open Economy IS LM Review---<br />Knowing that some students they do not learn this part before, Jenny gives a brief review on open economy part. It has almost nothing to deal with the new material, which is somehow good.<br /><br />Here starts the new material.<br />Textbook: SUW International Macroeconomics (available online)<br />This part is much better than what we learnt from the Blanchard one, which is mainly about theory without many real cases. I think this book is much more better in terms of explanation and arrangement of contents.<br /><br />Ch1: Global Imbalances<br />Countries' Current Account (CA), Financial Account, NIIP, NII.<br /><br />Ch2: Current Account Sustainability<br />The relationship between the terms introduced in Ch1. Is it possible for a country having persistent CA deficit (i.e. it is a debtor)?<br />Multi-period analysis, infinite period analysis on CA deficit and trade deficit.<br /><br />Ch3: Inter-temporal Theory of the Current Account<br />How does the current account react to income shocks? You have to use the 2-period inter-temporal consumption model again.<br /><br />Ch4: Terms of trade, World Interest Rates, Tariffs and the Current Account<br />Similar to Ch3 but introduce more factors other than income shock.<br /><br />Ch8: The real exchange rate and purchasing power parity<br />Very interesting topic. How to really compare the living standard of 2 countries? Why there is different prices for the same good around the world?<br />Big Mac Index; Law of One Price; Purchasing Power Parity; Border effect; Tradable and non-Tradable goods; Home Bias.<br /><br />Ch9: Cover 9.6 only<br /><br />Overall I think the new materials are very inspiring and interesting.",
            "comment_teaching": "Jenny's teaching is good. Fluent English. She would like to include many interactions with students.<br /><br />She writes her notes on a iPad, but sometime she scrolls very fast and you are lost where she is.<br /><br />You will notice that she starts teaching the new material after the midterm, leaving half semester left to teach the new material, and the new material is not that easy. Her pace starts increasing and you have to be fully concentrated to follow her every lesson. Personally I can catch up but I think it is not doable for many people.<br /><br />I think the change of syllabus is a big shock to the teaching team, therefore the TA seems to be not able to design new notes. We are having around 6-7 tutorials in this semesters and all it covers until the revision of open economy part in Blanchard.",

For the midterm it should be 2 points, and final is 3.5 points for every students. Not sure why they are adding points, maybe there are some ambiguous problems.",
            "comment_workload": "There is iPRS in class occasionally, and tutorial are taking attendance.<br /><br />The midterm will be a breeze, as it is just 3 chapters in Blanchard and one 2-period model (this is harder).<br /><br />I think the teaching team does not have time to design the problem sets for the new material, therefore they are using the questions on textbook (which is quite hard). And I think they are giving out points leniently.<br /><br />The final is not cumulative. It includes a little bit of Blanchard Open Economy part and mainly the SUW part. The problems are at medium level and since statistics are not out, I have no idea how the class perform as well.",
