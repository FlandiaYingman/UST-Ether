        "description": "This course is designed to educate students with little or no technical background and experience to have a general understanding and a fun learning experience of the charismatic subject of robots. Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day-to-day lives, also fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence technologies. New technologies such as wireless communication, voice and visual understanding, and machine learning will make robots become behaviour-based, cognitive and biologically inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human-machine society will be identified and disscussed in interactive sessions. This learning process transcends the conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and it is facilitated with a series of demonstrative sessions which present students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of autonomous robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will also focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions with robotic and automation technology that could potentially impact the quality of our life. In this exploration process, students are encouraged to apply their personal background and interest to conceive and experiment with the aid of robot kits. The course will cultivate students with enriched perspectives of a future society.",
