The submission dates of these 2 labs for this LANG course are few weeks after the submission of ENVS, so the lab reports are already written. But the criteria and requirements for LANG and ENVS are very different, so it's not possible to get a good grade by just submitting the same report for both courses.<br /><br />Attendance 80% required. The lessons are only until week 7, no lessons after that.",
