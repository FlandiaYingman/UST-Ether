Moreover, as a Year 2 business student, I had the advantage because some chapters of this course are identical to MGMT 2110. These include 4 functions of management (planning, organising, leading and controlling); bias of decision making (e.g. halo effect); motivation; leadership.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group project, where a group of 6 students watch an episode of Undercover Boss, analyse management issues exist in that particularly company, then give recommendations in a 15-minute presentation. A 5-minute Q&amp;A follows, where your group will probably be challenged by the prof and the class.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both exams, there are MC questions which are mostly based on management concepts, and a few short essay questions, based on business cases (in which you need your common sense) and management concepts.",

Although the prof did try to making the course more interesting by adding many case analyses and fun video clips, I bet a number of students didn't pay attention.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, since the prof places emphasis on participation, many students were eager to respond. The downside is that quite some of the responses were repetitive but the prof still kept allowing 10 students to answer the same question, and this affected the class progress.",

To avoid altering the average score of the reviews I am choosing 'A', 'B', 'B' and 'B' respectively for Content, Teaching, Grading and Workload.<br /><br />Though I didn't register the course, I think I am still eligible to express my opinions regarding the only lecture I attended. At the beginning of the lecture, students were required to put a name tag on their desks. Since I am not used to this practice, it feels like the name tag on a dog dish. I also observed that the professor was very passionate and engaging, while some students were very active in answering his questions (probably due to the 10% class participation in the grading scheme, or their extroverted personalities rooted in their genes), which made me very uncomfortable. <br /><br />Have you ever heard of the story of Sisyphus in Greek mythology? Sisyphus was punished by Hades to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll down every time it neared the top, repeating this action for eternity. Well, my feeling for this course is similar to Sisyphus. <br /><br />If you are an introvert like me who hopes for an easy A-range, you should think thrice before registering this course since class participation is critical to your final grade; but if you are an extrovert and like to talk shit all day long, you are good to go.",

Pavel will talk about potential areas to be examined during lesson time, you will know as long as you are attentive. I would say higher effort does result in higher grade, since exam questions are not difficult but require you to be familiar with the content. Time is quite tight so do the questions quickly. Rubrics as follows<br /><br />Class Participation 10%<br />Group Presentation 25%<br />Mid-term 30% <br />Final 35%<br /><br />For participation, answer one question per 2 lessons can already help you score a good mark. Typing answers in the chatbox also count so just copy and paste what others typed.<br />For group presentation, as long as you present stuff logically, relate course content with the content in the video, you will receive a decent score. Q&amp;A session is chill.<br /><br />My statistics are as follows:<br />Mid-term: 100/100 (Mean: 81.36, sd: 15.73)<br />Final: 100/100 (Mean: 82.92, sd: 14.82)<br />Project: 24/25 (Mean: 21.71, sd: 1.76)<br />No idea about my participation mark, given my participation in class, I guess I would receive at least an 8/10.<br /><br />Final grade: A+",

            "comment_content": "Basic business concepts related to everyday life are taught. Students with advanced business background might find some concepts overlap with other business courses (e.g. unbounded rationality, red queen effect, black swan event, merger and acquisition, etc). Indeed, nearly one third of the course content is about psychology. Business management and decisions are often related to psychology. Taking SOSC 1960 at the same time might also help you better understand the inter-relation among human behavior and business world.",
            "comment_teaching": "There were three instructors for this course -- John Jamison, Arden Leung, and Andy Yun. <br /><br />John Jamison was responsible for the first half of the course. He is a difficult and creative thinker who always encourages us to think deeply and independently by asking some creative questions, which are worth pondering over. Even if you sit remain silent, not voicing out your opinions, you can still gain a lot listening to him and other classmates.<br /><br />Arden Leung was one of the instructors who taught the second half. Comparatively, his lessons were less interesting. Yet, his presentations and explanations were clear, illustrated with numerous daily-life examples. Despite being informative, his lessons are of high quality.<br /><br />Andy Yun was a Korean lecturer who gave the last few lessons. His Korean accent and not-proficient-enough English often hindered you from understanding. His presentation was not well-organised rather. Although he is knowledgeable and experienced in management field, his teaching is not most effective IMO (yet not disastrous at least).",
            "comment_grading": "The lenient grading is most praiseworthy for this course.<br /><br />Distribution of total score<br />20% exam 1<br />30% exam 2<br />30% group presentation<br />10% attendance<br />10% participation<br /><br />The total score (not even individual items) was not released unfortunately. I performed quite satisfactorily in both exams (I guess both were &gt;80%). Full attendance and constant participation. Yet, I thought I flunked out in the group presentation. There were some professional and impressing groups but ours was only of mediocre quality. I predicted to get a B-/B originally. Luckily, it turned out to be A-, which fulfilled my goal when I decided to take this course. I guess no people got C range for this course.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say there is not much to do in this course.<br />Throughout the semester, what you need to do is to pay attention and think carefully during lesson. At home, revise the concepts in lecture notes thoroughly. The exam is not that tricky when you are familiar with those concepts. Plus, the two exams only contain 50 MCQs. No open-ended questions/ short essays are included. <br /><br />For the group project, they will assign you into group and the video to be watched. Then, you have to identify the management problems in the video and propose some possible solutions. Apply what you have learnt in lessons will help. Not much details have to be elaborated since each group only has 10 minutes to give the presentation.",
