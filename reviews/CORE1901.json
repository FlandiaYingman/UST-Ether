However, Prof. Zheng tends to let girls answer the questions, making me harder to get the participation marks. In the other two modules, I also saw the TA wrote -1 on the score sheet, clearly u get deduct marks for behave poorly. OMFG what is this course? U almost need to answer at least 2 questions every lesson to get a good score<br />Quiz- 25% (12.5 % each)<br />nothing much to say, open book, open discussion. So try to get full mark.<br />HW-60% (20% each)<br />Completely random.<br />U are assigned a few articles to read. And then u need to analyse them using the things taught in class(hv notes in canvas, dun worry). Little reminder, choose gender inequality and write for feminism or else u will know what is low mark.<br /><br />What grade do i get? B+<br />U will never know what will happen in this course. Someone (sorry) got 7 marks in total higher than me in terms of hw and quizzes, but also got B+. While another one got 5 marks in total higher than me got A-, so participation marks = all.",

He's very approachable and encourages class interaction both in person and on mentimeter.<br /><br />He also likes to joke that he studied the two most useless Ph subjects; Physics and Philosophy (don't ask him why).<br /><br />I do find that he is easily distracted from reading (funny) mentimeter responses though.<br /><br />In tutorials they have professors from the respective departments. It was sometimes boring but it depends on the professor.<br /><br />Grading participation was very awkward. The TA acts like the class president and just runs around ticking people who spoke in class (it's ridiculous).",

He also emphasises on how HKUST changed its grading policy and bell curve grading is removed (I don't believe this at all!!!) <br /><br />Overall good grading, getting mean is B, and scoring upper quartile in essay is easily A range. Percentage matters, and you can lose a sub-letter grade for losing 1-2% overall... <br /><br />1.

MC Quizzes - 25%, 12.5% each (/12.5)<br />They are open book and open discussion. The questions are quite tricky so take extra caution on the semantics.
