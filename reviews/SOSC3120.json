        "description": "This course examines the economic situations of low and middle-income economies, considering many important topics in the field of development economics. It addresses questions such as what factors help explain why some countries are rich and others poor and whether economic policies can affect these factors. We will study key aspects of life for poor households in the developing world, such as inequality, gender and the intra-household division of resources, education, child labor, health, savings and credit, institutions and globalization. Students will also study recent research in the field and examine empirical evidence on these topics. Prior knowledge in introductory economics and basic statistics is beneficial.",

The exams are tough, but the assignments (problem sets) and the reading report can help you gain some marks. The problem sets are just merely counting marks on your effort, as she doesn't look for 100% completion but just wanting to see students attempt the questions.",

Thus I only had 1 midterm (25%), 2 small problem sets of five questions each(15%), a reading report ( 30%) and a big problem set that had 10 questions( 30%).",
