The midterm includes linear and discrete optimization and final includes the other three. Linear programming is the most important topic in this course, but it's not hard. Just following the steps in notes is OK, and the other thing is only calculation. But make sure not to make mistakes in your calculation.<br />For discrete programming, you may need to think more to get the ideas on formulating the problem using binary variables.<br />For networking programming, you just need to remember which model to choose for different kinds of network problems. The solving part is relatively easy.<br />For dynamic programming, the most important thing is to find out the stages and states and then draw the network of the problem.<br />For non-linear programming, just try to understand a set of new concepts and the search procedures. This chapter is not the key point of this course.",
