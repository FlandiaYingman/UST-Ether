        "description": "First, we are going to present the macroscopic Navier-Strokes equations, emphasize its underlying modeling for the continuum flow, and introduce the standard numerical discretization. In order to understand the flow physics microscopically, we are going to introduce the Boltzmann equation, and the Chapman-Enskog expansion to derive the Navier-Strokes equations. At the same time, the modeling scales underlying different governing equations will be emphasized. Then, the numerical methods for the Baltzmann equation, such as Lattice Boltzmann method, gas-kinetic scheme, and\nDirection Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) Method, will be introduced for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium flow simulations. At end, we will introduce the methodology for the development of multi-scale method. The examples include the unified gas-kinetic schemes for both rarefied and continuum flow simulations, and the unified method for radiative transport process. The development of the unified gas-kinetic scheme is the state of the art for the construction of multiscale modeling for computational fluid dynamics. It will play an important role in science and engineering for the study of non-equilibrium flows. This course is suitable for PG students who are interested in computational fluid dynamics, and work on related fields, such as flow simulation, heat transfer, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.",
