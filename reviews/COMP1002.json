Hovewer, when it comes to general of the class it is logical.<br />It can be said that content is sufficient for the 1st level. So I see the course as useful. But do not be upset if you cannot learn well this course, the content is the same as the resources you can find on the internet. But more u have higher, more you tend to programming.",
