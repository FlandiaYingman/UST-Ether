            "comment_content": "So the geometry we’ve been learning since high school is the Euclidean Geometry, which basically are all derived/extended from 5 postulates which have been set by Euclid.<br />The first 4 axioms seems rather obvious, but the fifth (the parallel postulate) seems less obvious than the others.<br />Mathematicians tried to derive/disprove the parallel postulate from the first four axioms (so they can get rid of the parallel postulate), and everyone of them failed. (And it was proved later that it cant be done)<br />So the other mathematicians started to think that maybe the parallel postulate is independent from (which means it cannot be proved or disproved from) the other 4 axioms, and they started to construct geometry systems, which are totally different from the Eucliean geometry, and the journey started.<br /><br />The course was, at least for me, like a journey that Ive been through for a semester. <br />In the other systems of geometry, things which were very obvious in the Euclidean geometry are no longer obvious, or some of them might no longer be true.<br />And the best part of the course for me was the moment in the end of the semester, we combine everything we’ve learnt from the course to prove the independency of the parallel postulate, and finally finish the long long journey.<br /><br />After proving the independency, professor briefly introduced concepts about hyperbolic geometry, which isnt a major part of the course, but worth learning one or two.<br /><br />The content itself isn’t that hard, its just that you might need some time to accept the fact that everything which you thought they are pretty obvious may no longer be obvious, or not even correct in other systems. It might be a little confusing in the beginning.",
            "comment_teaching": "Great great teaching. <br />It’s my second course with professor Ku Yin Bon, the first was MATH2741 Geometric Construction.<br />I enjoyed the contents of MATH2741 very much but to be honest, i didn’t enjoy his teaching.<br />So i thought this course wasnt going to be interesting, but i was wrong.<br />In this course, his teaching was excellent, he explains everything so well so that everyone could understand.",
