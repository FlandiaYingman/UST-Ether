        "description": "This course introduces the essential theoretical frameworks, methods, concepts, tools and techniques used to enable robotic perception and behavior, with particular emphasis on applications in autonomous mobile robots. The course starts from Bayesian programming and probabilistic methods, and then moves on to cover generic machine learning, especially deep learning. It also includes coverage of reinforcement learning. Important libraries for hand-on experiments for mobile robotic systems will be introduced. The students will have the opportunity to test their algorithms and implementations on real platforms.",
