            "comment_content": "When a boy first entered the classroom of MATH 1014, he believed it would be a manageable course.<br /><br />&quot;I have studied M2,&quot; he thought. His heart persuaded him that online comments saying it is difficult were because they haven't taken M2.<br /><br />Days after days and mid-term exam passed,<br />One day when I was taking the bus, I saw the canvas notification, I knew, the date of judgment came. Click it, click it, wtf it kept loading,,,, loading....loading...and my heart was gradually falling... falling... and falling.<br />Suddenly, the screen turned red! The Canvas red! loading finish, and the score...<br /><br />38/100<br /><br />I couldn't believe it, was I a rubbish? oh sorry it was not a question. I was a rubbish. And it was my destiny to fail. Thank you UST, my dearest UST, it was you that gave me such a memorable experience that I would never forget. As a finance student, getting an F is equivalent to a failure, a loser... and my dream to pursue a Finance career is just like a joke...<br /><br />I need to work hard. I knew it, but given the 35% mid-term weighting, any attempt seemed to be useless. I cried, I desperated, I shouted, I laugh, I... Maybe... I was emotionally collapsed. <br /><br />I heard a lot of students were shouting or complaining at the forum, but I don't even have the motivation to shout. I tired...At a night around 2am, when I was once again despressed by what my destiny was. Suddenly, an email came...<br /><br />THE GRADING SYSTEM CHANGED！<br /><br />Mid term exam could be transferred to final! Suddenly, I smiled. I knew it was the God-given chance. I am not very bad at studying, and I knew it would be the only chance to prevent a F, which require 7 A+ if you still wish a dean list. <br /><br />At that time, although it was at night full of darkness, I could feel a slight ray of hope was shinning on the sky, and waiting me to catch it.<br /><br />I saw the Angel!<br /><br />At the remaining time, I worked hard to fight for my grade. I knew, I really knew, that god won't give me a third chance. So the 90%-weighted final would be my only hope.<br /><br />...<br />...<br />...<br /><br />The exam ended, and I knew all the things gone, the toughness, the struggling, the effort... would be all become such a tiny little number, that would decide my whole destiny. <br /><br />To be or not to be, that is a question. <br />To pass or not to pass, that decides my destiny.<br /><br />At the end of the end, after clicking multiple times of canvas, my final score comes:<br /><br />...<br /><br />96/100<br /><br />Suddenly, I was speechless. My voice was scrambling, and my eyes were staring at the screen.<br /><br />Thank you MATH 1014 - you demonstrate a journey of life. From a talented M2 student to a fail student, and from a fail student to become a normal student again. <br /><br />It is a simulation of a game of life <br /><br />Where there is a will, there is a way...",

Given that about 150 students did not take the midterm exam, unlikely due to health problems, one could tell how confident some students were before the midterm day.<br /><br />I do not find it necessary to argue about the level of difficulty of the midterm, and from a distribution point of view the midterm turns out to be somewhat normal; a bell-shaped instead of an L-shaped distribution. To put it on record, the past Math1014 exams before the rise of the all mighty ZOOM were all closed book exams, without calculator too.<br /><br />Anyway, taking these unfortunate ZOOM days, or years, into account, I’ve unprecedentedly put a full solution of the midterm exam in the final exam information webpage. You probably should look at it and reflect on what went wrong with your own preparation for the midterm, especially if you fell apart in the midterm. Mumbling about how unfair the midterm was when compared with the past would not help a bit for passing the final. Still a few weeks of time to go before the end of the semester.<br /><br />We are not here to bury students with Calculus, and there is no problem for us to switch into a max of two assessment scheme to release some pressure on students:<br /><br />10%Homework + Max(35% midterm + 55% final,&nbsp;&nbsp;90% final)&nbsp;&nbsp;out of 100%<br /><br />However, if you want a decent grade, you would have to work for it.<br /><br />No assessment scheme can completely resolve the problems of those who are hit by anxiety. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help from the counselors in the Counseling and Wellness Center of HKUST if necessary.<br /><br />https://counsel.hkust.edu.hk/<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />-TK",

I removed Scheme 2 since it is confusing. Scheme 2 was used for a reference only for the system.” (Jishan HU, 2022) 咁呀，d人之後拎住TKL封email對質，結果佢先跟翻兩個scheme，睇黎TKL真係有好好盡到coordinator既責任，竟然可以係出grade之前確保所有section用兩個grading system，好L感動。<br /><br />好啦好啦，終於出grade，小弟就total 90.1拎A-既，本來就覺得純粹爛grade就算啦，好死唔死比我發現其他section 89.2有A grade。我OS：呀胡生， 90.1&gt;89.2咁簡單既數唔洗學生教你呀嘛？你咁高IQ係咪先^^ 得得得，忍一時風平浪靜，我send封email問TKL發生咩事，佢話個excel檔未update我個分，係咪真係咁信下好啦，話唔定係咪每個section自己拉curve都唔知。TKL跟住就叫我揾紫珊瑚更正個grade，我email佢，佢就遲遲唔肯覆email。最好笑係我一forward埋比TKL，紫珊瑚幾分鐘内幫我update個grade。好啦更正翻個grade，大團圓結局了。<br /><br />係肺炎期間online上堂，竟然能夠比一個咁精彩，咁多花生食既course比我，TKL受少少氣都值得既，我代替班學生黎多謝你，仲有bye bye你條尾，係咁多~",

            "comment_teaching": "If the content is the more positive thing about this course, then the teaching, and administration, are utter trainwrecks.<br /><br />If we purely talk about the teaching of the course material, TK Lam actually did an OK job, despite frequent miscalculations. The most irritating thing is the attitude of the administration of this course.<br /><br />After the midterm (the arrangements of which you can read from the Grading section), students complained that the grading scheme unfairly favours those who skipped the midterm. TK Lam responded by emailing us the following:<br />1. Saying the midterm is not particularly difficult when compared to past years, and the distribution is bell curved;<br />2. &quot;Unprecedentedly&quot; putting the midterm solutions up (shouldn't this be your responsibility anyways? &quot;Instructors should.... Provide timely and constructive formative feedback to students on their performance as an important part of the student learning process.&quot; (Academic Registry, 2022)); <br />3. Blaming students for not working hard; and<br />4. Telling us to seek professional counseling.<br /><br />Apart from being unnecessarily rude and very condescending, it shows a total disregard of students who may be suffering due to insufficient MATH background. Students with C/D in 1012 might be forced to enrol in this course as it is a program requirement. Some other reviewers who quoted TKLam and wrote, &quot;There are no excuses apart from laziness.&quot; should consider that the world does not revolve around them, and everyone's circumstances are different.<br /><br />Another egregious example of administrative failure can be readily seen in the poor coordination between instructors. One instructor mentioned nearly verbatim the reduction formulae question in midterm. However, he immediately dismissed students' concerns by saying &quot;this will not be examined in the midterm and final examination because it's too time consuming&quot;. The question appeared nearly exactly in the midterm. This highlights the failure in coordination and management of this course.<br /><br />The instructor of my tutorial, Phyllis, provided useful notes and exercises. Her teaching is the only positive thing I can say about the teaching of this course.",
            "comment_grading": "If you consider the mean of the examinations, most of the lecture sections will have mean C or D. Most famously, L2 (TK Lam's section) got a failing mean for the midterm.<br /><br />The grading scheme was originally as follows:<br />10% Homework, 35% Midterm, 55% Final<br /><br />Before the midterm, there were several threads on Goop (a social media platform targeted towards local higher ed students) about their unpreparedness for the midterm. Some anonymous people commented that they should skip the midterm if they are not prepared enough, as the midterm percentage will be automatically transferred to the final. <br /><br />After the midterm, &quot;around 150 students&quot; (TK Lam, 2022) are found to have skipped the (more difficult) midterm. As one lecturer who wishes to remain anonymous mentioned, skipping the midterm to get a better grade should never have been an option without medical proof. How is it fair that students are allowed to skip major course grading components freely without repercussions?<br /><br />After the midterm, the following appeared in the final webpage:<br />&quot;No makeup exam will be arranged for minor medical reason, even with a letter form a clinical doctor. Exceptions will only be made if you are hospitalized with proof.&quot;<br /><br />One can only note that TK Lam is a remarkably &quot;compassionate&quot; professor.<br /><br />The new grading scheme, after complaints detailed in &quot;Teaching&quot;, are as follows:<br />10% Homework + max(35% midterm and 55% final, and 90% final only)<br /><br />A final anecdote: The instructor who gave away the midterm question previously (in the &quot;Teaching&quot; section) removed the 2nd grading scheme because it was &quot;too complicated&quot;. Although this was swiftly remedied, it again highlights the incompetence in management and administration.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is moderate, as per MATH course standards.<br /><br />The only workload is revision for both exams, and completing the (unlimited tries) homework.<br /><br />Do get full marks in every homework, as you'll need something to save your grade after midterms and finals.<br /><br />Maybe the main workload is dealing with the constant load of bullshit.",

The spring one is absolute trash, the only reason why so many students need to retake it in summer.<br />Calculus II, so basically an advanced course designed to carry on the teaching in MATH 1012/1013, however, the bridging is actually very poor, resulting in basically having no idea of what's going on if you didn't do well in 1012/1013. And it is especially disadvantageous to 1012 students since they have no calculus background in high school.",

She focus a lot on sub-topics that are actually not the key point of the chapters.

At least he is familiar with the topics covered in this course because he is in charge of the course for decades. However, sometimes he may cover examples which are not commonly found in the textbook and some topics are actually quite difficult to understand by just read the textbook. He addressed those parts with limited examples and not explaining in a very clear manner.Furthermore, he covers the topics in a fast manner and rush for completing all the content due to limited lecture time. And his writing... I think most of you know he writes in a messy and unorganized manner, sometimes he did mistakes and spent a lot of time searching the root of mistakes due to his terrible writing. <br />He is not that god-like but still just fine. <br /><br />For Phyllis, the specialized IA of TK Lam, did a much better job.

I learnt A-Level Single-Mathematics and its basically an extension of the AL syllabus. However when you get to the 2nd half of the course (aka after mid-term), you better get your stuff together because polars and series are absolute HELL.<br /><br />I suggest you to buy the book Calculus by J.Steward before the semester starts. You should learn in advance cause this is a very fast paced course. Literally no time to digest the contents whatsoever.",

I mean the kid that goes to math competitions, genuinely loves math and can spend all day thinking about math. That is what's required to get an A in this course in my opinion. <br /><br />I always thought math was one of my strongest subjects until I took this course. I did a Math EE for IB and was able to consistently score 6's and 7's in HL AA Mathematics. <br /><br />Despite being the course that I studied for 3x more than my other courses, it ended up being my worst grade. (B-). Don't get me wrong, it's not impossible to get an A, it's just very very very very very very very difficult.<br /><br />The tutorial guy is very nice though which is a plus.<br />Format is Calc II material.",
            "comment_teaching": "CHIANG, Edmund is truly an interesting teacher. If you enjoy math you will genuinely enjoy this course. However, if you simply want to get a good grade, I wish you luck. <br /><br />His teaching takes a pure approach to the theories being taught in class. It is very methodical and well thought out. Except for the fact that you can't understand half of what he is saying if you do not have a strong background in proofs. Furthermore, his lectures sometimes deviate from the course material purely for his own interest. He claims &quot;you guys must know about this, this is the most interesting modern approach to mathematics there is&quot;. Only to say at the end of the lecture that it isn't required for the course.<br /><br />So anyways, I hate this professor honestly, it's simply not the way I wish to be taught Math. I skipped all lectures after he began deviating from the course material (lecture 9?) and just learned from the organic chemistry tutor on YT.",
            "comment_grading": "Weighting:<br />25% midterm, 15% HW, 60% Finals <br /> <br />HW is easy because you have infinite attempts so not getting 100% on the HW will put you behind. <br /><br />Mid-term is maybe 100% easier than the final, because the test is open-book you simply need to print out the lecture notes and it's 25% of the test for free probably?&nbsp;&nbsp;It's still difficult though.<br /><br />Final is also open book, but it won't help. Because our dear professor loves the pure side of Calc II so much that he decided to change the format of the final test. I completed all the previous past papers of MATH1014 and was able to score 80% timed. On the actual final I got 44%. Why? Because the questions being asked were not similar at all to all 3 past papers. Completely a different approach to testing students. Which in my opinion, is stupid because you should be rewarded for studying past papers? no? Maybe it's just an IB thing. <br /><br />Anyways in my opinion if you get CHIANG, Edmund, you should attend every lecture and genuinely try to keep up with what he's saying, that's the best bet at getting a good grade in this course. <br /><br />Except for the lectures where he teaches things that are irrelevant to the course, which you won't know until he tells you at the end of the lecture so... yeah. <br /><br />ALSO:<br />Grading is absolute I've heard, so standard deviation whatever doesn't matter. <br /><br />HW:<br />Mean = 75.38%<br /><br />Mid-term<br />Mean = 48.6%<br /><br />Final<br />Mean = 37.63%<br /><br />Total:<br />Mean = 47.3%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD=18.4%<br />Me: 57% = B- <br /><br />Here is exactly how the grading works:<br />1.) they determine the mean after all exams are done<br />2.) they make the mean a high C+<br />3.) everything else is relatively graded based off this mean. +0.5 sd is B-, +1.0 sd is B-B+, +2SD is A range?

His explanations are also quite quick, so you have to pay close attention. He also makes lots of mistakes, which people often point out.<br /><br /><br />This professor is clearly passionate though, as mentioned earlier. After one lecture, I asked him a question about the complex form of the trigonometric functions and whether I could use those to my advantage in exams. After answering my question, he took me outside for a 30 minute one-to-one lecture on the history of maths and mathematicians/physicists/philosphers like Newton and Ramanujan and their contributions. It was interesting but certainly uncalled for.<br /><br />The TA (Tommy) is very good according to my classmates. I agree to an extent but I found his teaching somewhat boring, but he taught some really useful manouevers which definitely helped in the exams. You should attend his tutorials.",

Some questions are tricky though, so don't leave it to the last minute.<br /><br />The midterm is moderately difficult. The main difficulty is the time limit, so try and speed through easier questions and find clever shortcuts if you can.<br /><br />The final is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. There were questions on my final that I would suspect most people cannot do. It is especially difficult for people who try and follow a rigid formula for working out similar categories of questions. For some questions, you need to be more flexible.<br /><br />There was also one 3 mark question which was completely out of syllabus and could only be solved by referring to a very specific proof in the lecture notes. Oh, and I shouldn't forget to mention that proof had many bugs. The max score for the final was 97/100, so one could guess that even the top scorer could not solve that problem. <br /><br />My grades:<br />Webwork: 100%<br />Midterm: 55/70<br />Final: 80/100<br /><br />Overal: 82.64% (grade A)",

He provides the textbook which is pretty good in giving formulas and proofs.<br /><br />Bad observations: lack of electronic adaptation, like iPad.

Given that about 150 students did not take the midterm exam, unlikely due to health problems, one could tell how confident some students were before the midterm day.<br /> <br />I do not find it necessary to argue about the level of difficulty of the midterm, and from a distribution point of view the midterm turns out to be somewhat normal; a bell-shaped instead of an L-shaped distribution. To put it on record, the past Math1014 exams before the rise of the all mighty ZOOM were all closed book exams, without calculator too.<br /> <br />Anyway, taking these unfortunate ZOOM days, or years, into account, I’ve unprecedentedly put a full solution of the midterm exam in the final exam information webpage. You probably should look at it and reflect on what went wrong with your own preparation for the midterm, especially if you fell apart in the midterm. Mumbling about how unfair the midterm was when compared with the past would not help a bit for passing the final. Still a few weeks of time to go before the end of the semester.<br /> <br />We are not here to bury students with Calculus, and there is no problem for us to switch into a max of two assessment scheme to release some pressure on students:<br /> <br />10%Homework + Max(35% midterm + 55% final,&nbsp;&nbsp;90% final)&nbsp;&nbsp;out of 100%<br /> <br />However, if you want a decent grade, you would have to work for it.<br /> <br />No assessment scheme can completely resolve the problems of those who are hit by anxiety. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help from the counselors in the Counseling and Wellness Center of HKUST if necessary.",

He teaches the concepts decently but he frequently made computation errors which slowed down the lectures at times. I actually liked him as a professor before he sent that nasty email. It's clear that the man has no respect for students and refuses to see where the teaching team went wrong on this course.<br /><br />I do agree that students have the responsibility to work hard.

The fact that the midterm mean was very low (3x-4x) means that almost half the class failed or are nearing a D range grade. And what if you get +2 SD above the mean? Congratulations!!! You might get a B+ or a B. Wow.<br /><br />My friends from other universities said their Calculus II classes were reasonable. Simply getting above the mean will guarantee a B at the very least.

Trust me, i thought i was exceptionally good at Math until studying this course. I never had problem with math in my life but this made me hate mathematics<br /><br />Alot of questions on series and sequence on finals. Finals is alottttttt (i am emphasising ) harder than HW. I did spend alot of time revising stuff after mid-term, but some of them i still do not understand. <br /><br />Yeah, I know before i enroll to this course, i read reviews other ppl made on MATH 1014, i also thought i would do well if i spend enough time on this course and study on schedule, but as soon as i took my mid-term, i knew i was fucked.

Watch professor Leonard for the topic, do webwork, few days before exams do past papers - you probably won't regret it:)<br /><br />It's quite annoying when the professor says &quot;no time today, we will cover this segment rest class&quot; and doesn't do it. I stopped going to lectures within 2 weeks tbh. However, amongst all of them, I've heard TK Lam is the best. <br /><br /><br />I cannot emphasise this enough - watch professor Leonards videos from the start for every topic, make notes of the examples he uses. IT WILL HELP YOUR UNDERSTANDING SO MUCH. AND PAST PAPERS AFTER DOING ENOUGH CONTENT IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE",

The only KEY WORD is practice. practice a lot. Use webworks to practice per topic after learning the content. USE past papers to understand the format of the paper and get the timing right. Pray to god they don't include vectors. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE........ Midterm is probably going to be tough by the way and it covers 35% of your grade, so doing well on midterms is essential for an A range. For a B range, you can pull up in finals.",

(To be honest, sometimes find his hand written notes in lectures to be more helpful than those notes he post on canvas)<br />Although providing the proof may help with understanding the theory, it also cause the paste of the lecture section to lack behind others.

Even though he does speak with a lot of fillers, his English is at least much more understandable than other Mainland professors. As a matter of fact, he does provide lecture notes. After each lecture, he would organise his notes and upload both his written and digital notes on Canvas. Some may say that he includes too many out-of-syllabus proofs in his teaching, but in my opinion, this helps me understand the content better. Therefore, I don't know why many would think Avery is a bad teacher. It is possible that he simply had changed though.<br /><br />On the other hand, Phyllis is an excellent tutor as always. I skipped my original tutorials and went to hers in the last semester, and I am very glad that she has become my actual tutor this semester. Her notes are useful, and she explains the concepts clearly. Technically, just attending the tutorials is more than enough for this course.",

If you are not a careful student, good luck to you as you may drop one subgrade for every MC question you did wrong.<br /><br />For your reference:<br />- Homework (25%): full<br />- Final (75%): 90/100 (mean: 70.41)<br />- Final grade: A",

He just showed the proof of the theorem and demonstrated some simple examples during his lecture but not much for the calculation technique. Attending his lecture is not useful for concrete understanding. His style in the lecture note is unreadable and hard to understand too because there are many mathematical symbols. However, if you are good in Maths and interested in the proof, you may find it helpful.<br /><br />I advise the &quot;weaker&quot; students to go to tutorial sessions. The concept and skill will be explained well. Tutors are also easier to approach for asking questions. Moreover, the tutorial exercises are abundant for practice.<br /><br />BTW, The lecture note written by Dr. Ho Hon Ming is a masterpiece. It explains the concept very clearly with diagrams and provides sufficient examples with step-by-step solution. Make sure to get a copy of it.",

The question is more or less related to the worksheet in the tutorial, so better revised them. <br />The grading of the worksheet is like this. The full mark of each worksheet is 2. As long as you write something on it, you got 1 point. If you write some steps and try to finish some of the questions, you got the full mark. If you were absent or didn't submit, you got a 0.

But before he conducts his lectures, shouldn't there be someone to tell him that his handwriting is also hardly understandable and should use a PowerPoint or typed note instead???

However, after taking the course, I feel like it is not as bad as people have described, so I guess he improved on his English. <br /><br />During the first half of the course, the professor explains concepts clearly. However, during the last half, the topics became harder and the concept is not explained as clearly as before. Maybe since more and more people disappear and it is discouraging for the professor. After the midterm exam, most of what the professor explains in the lecture is not clear and helpful as before. <br /><br />The professor also make a lot of mistakes in his lecture notes so don't rely too much on it, although he will later correct his mistakes later onward",

It might be because he did not know how to use a virtual whiteboard, but the main point is that, it was really blur af, we could barely see what did he write, so it was quite hard to catch up. <br />Right, we could ask him questions when we do not understand, but he barely looks at the chatroom in zoom.<br />We all prefer to type in chatroom to ask questions, 'cause turning on a mic and speak was really awkward, I hope everyone would understand this. BUT, he doesn't look at the chatroom even he was sitting in front of the computer silently and waiting for questions. Some of us might be more brave so they would speak and ask, however the professor would always return us with a sentence &quot;I don't know what you don't understand&quot;. Yea, we also don't know what we don't understand but we just can't get the idea, that's why we are asking the question lol.",

As for the overall notes, LAM, Tsz Kim provides better and more accurate notes, more similar to the tests and tutorials given.",

The final exam itself only has 20 multiple choice questions, so it really depends on luck for some students rather than true knowledge. Most of the questions are usually similar to the tutorials but some advanced questions are included to test the students.",

Especially if you are a M1 student like me, however I would consider the exams to be easier than 1013.<br /><br />For the homework, its entirely possible to get full mark on every webwork since you can google the questions (even if you don't have chegg), if you are willing to spend the time its very doable, you also have infinite attempts, so you can spam and brute force some answers (if you are REALLY struggling).<br /><br />Overall I got full marks in the homework and 65/100 in the finals, and got a B-, fair grade considering I was only 2-3% higher than the mean.",

Beware of the submission time as it was quite tricky to be stated like 4:50 a.m.. <br /><br />For my revision, I printed out Ke’s notes as I couldn’t just skim and scan the notes without practicing questions.

Basically, if you are not confident with the content in this course, you can attend the tutorial session or do more exercise and practice more.<br />Avery's style of teaching is not suitable for me, there is no powerpoint during the lecture, just hand-copied notes from Avery. He will post it to the course page a few hours after the lecture. Therefore, it is optional whether you are going to copy the notes during lecture or not.<br />My tutor is Mr. Ho Ming Leung, his tutorial notes are nice and will give each theory an example question and full solution. There is additional exercise at the last page of the notes. However, I don't really know why the answer to additional exercise is not provided.",

However, you must get at least 40% of the course grade to get a pass in this course.<br />The mean for MT and Final is around 40% of the total mark because the performance of midterm is really poor so that Avery introduced another grading scheme which allowed students to omit their mid-term score. However, I think the final exam is more difficult than midterm so better work hard and try to score a higher mark in the midterm exam.",

            "comment_content": "Although this course is designated as the subsequent course of MATH 1013, the focus of this course is more on computations and less on proofs. Even though there are some proof questions appear in the exam, you just need to memorise all the methods mechanically, unlike in MATH 1013 where some proofs requires your Math maturity. Moreover some skills in this course, such as definite integral and its application, Taylor's expansion, series and its convergence e.t.c., are actually very useful in further studies. So I recommend people who are from science and engineering school, regardless of their future major, should work harder in learning the materials.<br /><br />One side note is that concept of vector is introduced at the end, which I believe people who studied M2 in high school should be rather familiar with. However for other students, such as those who studied M1 in high school, this would be a chance to learn vectors as a prerequisite of more advanced math courses, such as linear algebra.",
            "comment_teaching": "Many has already commented Dr. Ho's teaching so I am not going to repeat. It is worth notice though that if you wish to choose Mathematics as your major (especially those who wish to choose pure maths track, though I would expect you be studying MATH 1024) , you might also want to sit other Professor's lecture or learn from additional reference book because his teaching many focus on computations and the transition from theory to application, which is not that helpful in developing math maturity and learning develop different concepts rigorously.<br /><br />Einstein Kong is also a very helpful TA and he is also good at explaining abstract concepts. So do try to sit his tutorial (if there is).",
            "comment_grading": "In this semester, the Professors claimed that absolute grading scheme is used though I suspect grading curve is also employed. I am not in a very justified position to comment this so I shall refer to other comments for this section.",
            "comment_workload": "It really depends on your previous knowledge on calculus and your math maturity. M2 really helps reduce a lot of workload. However even if you haven't studied M2 before, you can theoretically avoid some workload as the assignments (WebWork) are rather trivial that you can find answers on the internet. Though this will probably cost your grade if you don't really understand how to solve the assignments. Bonus quizzes are useful in increasing sub grades or even avoiding failing this course so it is worth to try. You can refer to sample quiz and the actual quiz is about the same with number differences.",

One thing that is pretty obvious is that Fall sem is much more easier to get better results as many year 1 student from A-level will skip MATH1013 and study this course as well as professional engineering students will not take this course in Fall sem.

The way she will explain concepts to you are exemplary. She will ingrain them in your mind and make sure you understand fully before moving on.

From the light and kinky stuff like volumes of revolution to the hardcore and masochistic stuff like series expansions and partial fractions expansions. <br /><br />Okay, in all seriousness, it's Calculus 2 for those who follow the US curriculum. You learn integration techniques for the first half then you go on to learning series, sequences etc in the second half. I'm sure it's useful stuff, but still hard none the less.",
            "comment_teaching": "Extremely difficult to understand what he's saying. He has about a 1:1 ratio of filler words to actual words when &quot;teaching&quot;. So when he teaches it goes something like this &quot;uhh, so uhhh, today we will ummm, be talking about uhhh integration by errrr parts. To uhhhh integrate........&quot; When I heard that on the first class, I knew that I was in for a very bad time.<br /><br />Basically non-existent teaching. Instructor blitz through the content like there's no tomorrow. If you go to class, you can only hope to learn something through osmosis, because you'll be furiously taking notes that you'll never read/won't understand or you'll give up half way and just start playing with your phone or flirting with the girl next to you. Which you can then flex your intelligence and show her how much you've self learned. <br /><br />To rub salt into the wound, you get NDS students who seem to understand everything to the point where they can even correct the instructor's careless mistakes. fml. If they're that good, why even go to class??",

            "comment_workload": "The only redeeming thing about this course is the workload. The only continuous assessment that is given is the infamous webwork. However, the webwork gives you unlimited tries so you can slowly guess your way through each assesment which takes only about 1.5-2 hours each on average. Or you could Wolfram Alpha that shit and be done in 15 minutes if you don't give a damn about learning the material.",

His lecture style is just to use the whiteboard for everything, very wonderful as we can follow how he thinks. His presentation skills in terms of delivering the content is spectacular, everything just links together as lecture approaches the end: you can see him trying to show a theorem many times with various examples as if until you are convinced. Feel free to keep him after lecture for questions and you would see him solving them with you. (Handwritten notes available later online)<br /><br />- Weakness: His English accent is not particularly good but understandable. His pace of going through concepts and examples in a lecture can be quick and even accelerating, but it is equally satisfying if you manage to follow such a pace; there is often a 5 minute break in the middle :)<br /><br /><br />Zeta Chan, our tutorial TA, is very practical in solving questions. More like exam-oriented style problem-solving, which is interesting because Prof. Li put it theoretically and you may yet see how you can apply things. A big thumbs-up for his tutorial question set: he stapled and prepared a collection of all-topic questions across the whole semester, just bring that over every time and go to the question he is doing now (answers in a file was released online later). Questions are also highly welcomed; he would walk to you to confirm if you did it right, either by asking or looking at your writing. His English carries the Hong Kong-er accent but you can tell despite this he lays out things intuitively.<br /><br /><br />TA support in the Math Support Center is sufficient but usually poorly delivered. I don't feel welcomed, but rather kind of a trouble asking obvious questions. Maybe the TAs are already annoyed with meticulous queries of simple questions, and they are systematic enough to put up solutions onto the whiteboard just letting us to refer to it. But regardless of how much we learnt, this is not a learning environment that encourages trying, at least to me.",

Tutorial exercises are recommended as revision materials before final, because merely understanding would not be enough. You can even get tutorial exercises from other tutorial sessions, for example I used: Einstein's https://sites.google.com/site/einsteinkongstutorialwebsite/<br /><br />(Quiz: in this semester we have the quizzes starting from Easter break. 4 quizzes split into two periods to take, two quizzes available each period.<br />There were sample questions available for you to exercise with for as much time as you wish, and frankly the format is again very similar to the real quizzes.<br />Recommended to take them all early because as the deadline approaches the Math Support Center would be full-house but you must take the quiz with the computers there not yours; the quiz also has a time limit of 15-25 mins, so taking it with fewer people around shall relieve stress if any)<br /><br />For math lovers or curious people: I made notes solely on equations/concepts on my own and did the in-lecture/tutorial examples together with the lecturer/TA. So in my humble opinion, paying more attention during lecture and tutorial plus some little reinforcements at times would save much time. It is both more rewarding and efficient.",

At the end of each lectures, he will ask all students whether they have questions, I have never seen that there was students raising questions at that moment. However, if you really have questions, you can and you should ask him after the lectures. He is willing to answer you.

Still no one reply my email after one week. What would you feel when you spend a lot of time on setting query and composing emails but the receiver ignore them. I don't really care whether they are strong or not but I care about their attitude. But I guess one male TA of L9 is decent and acceptible because he tried hard to answer my questions in tutorial class T9A. Although I might not fully understand some concepts, I still appreciate his efforts.<br /><br />Also, Ye Guibo's accent is bad. For example, in last few lectures I finally figure out that &quot;offer-we-are-say&quot; is &quot;obviously&quot;. So pay attention to it.<br /><br />Another thing is that she doesn't want to run the risk of being late on another class so she would only answer you very briefly if you ask her questions right after class in that situation.<br /><br />In tutorial class, most people just attend the first one to see whether the TA are good or not and whether attendance would be taken or not.

Not much of a math person but I can definitely see how it would fascinate some :) <br /><br />Biggest issue with content is the allocation of time for each section and how it was delivered.

            "comment_teaching": "Disclaimer: I am in a good mood today, this review is likely biased in TK's favor. (On a regular day, will give him F) <br /><br />Teaching Style:<br />TK likes to go into a lot of theory not useful for exam. He also enjoys making up questions on the spot that he cannot solve without making 2+ mistakes. Very hard to follow and connect theory/proofs to questions solved, especially as they are not similar to exam or homework style questions and he does not explain thought process before solving + always makes mistakes. <br />Often, he just explains and derives the origins of each formula/shortcut mathematically but allocates very little time to <br />how and when to use each formula. <br /><br />Time: <br />Spent too much time re-capping 1013/high school content that we were left with 3 lessons before finals for the final topic. TK decided to not test on final topic but notified everyone with 1 week before the exam. He also kept teaching the final topic and did not go over previous content at all (in SBM it is common for professors to have 1-2 revision lessons to refresh our minds before finals season)<br /><br />TK's unpreparedness in lessons meant that he did a lot of improv. He makes up questions on the spot and sometimes decides halfway through solving it that it is too tedious and changes the question - but doesn't demonstrate how to solve it! (He only gave a general/theoretical explanation). He also makes a lot of mistakes that students have to point out. Would hence recommend rewatching recordings instead of joining live. <br />To buy time for improv, he writes down everything he says on his iPad. Whereas TAs have prepared condensed, no BS version of curriculum and some even have handwritten scans of questions, solutions, diagrams etc (like PPT style teaching) and explain things more thoroughly. Highly recommend watching tutorials (fortunate for me, zoom Uni meant I had access to all TA tutorials in 2 lectures so I could choose the one that suited me most)",

It is quite likely to appear in Mid-term and Final exams.<br /><br />If you've studied M2 in secondary school, Congratulations! <br />You have relatively less workload than others, but you've to pay extra attention to Convergence tests for Series as many students failed to understand and apply in the exam questions.
