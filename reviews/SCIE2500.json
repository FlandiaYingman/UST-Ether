            "comment_content": "In this course, you need to identify a supervisor, have weekly meetings with him/her, write a progress report, a final literature review and give a final presentation. <br />The main task is to do literature review on a specific topic, but the content really depends on you and your supervisor. <br />I am a life science student, so some of my feelings and suggestions may not be applicable to other subjects, but you can take a look if you'd like to.",
            "comment_teaching": "The workflow really depends on you and your supervisor.<br />Most of the people I know didn't seem to really meet their supervisors every week. Some of them present papers that they read to their supervisor every two or three weeks, some of them just work with research assistant rather than the professor. As for me, I only met my professor two or three times I think... It is my fault that I didn't save time to read papers and thus had almost nothing to discuss with him or ask him, but he also seems very busy and didn't have time to care... And he forgot the meeting time for two times... Then I proposed maybe it is not necessary to meet every week and I will ask for help when I need to. This is a bad proposal, and the predictable consequence is that I only started reading papers days before the ddl for progress report, and one week before the ddl for final one.",

(10% +20%)<br />The final presentation, 15 min (&lt;20 slides) (10%)<br /><br />I got A in the end. Seems that everyone gets the same grade, just as in SCIE2500. Maybe most people get A?<br /><br />Another point is that I was very nervous before the final presentation, partly because I wasn't well-prepared, and also partly because I was afraid the IRE coordinator would criticize my bad work. (Your audience would be your supervisor + IRE coordinator) But it turned out to be ok as they all understand that ug students know nothing about research and didn't have very high expectations, and their questions were not to challenge you.",
            "comment_workload": "Since I only started preparing for the report and presentation no longer than 10 days before the deadline, the workload was super big and I was almost driven crazy. I felt miserable as this course could have brought me more interactions with the professor and more insights into the topic, but I just ended up being a ddl fighter and didn't learn much. I would suggest other students taking this course to fix a literature reading time into your schedule and try your best to meet with your supervisor every week to get the most out of this course. Only by averaging the workload to every day would it be easier. Another suggestion is that please make sure that you summarize what you understood from a paper by a few pages of slides or a short paragraph right after reading it, otherwise you would not be able to recall a single word after several days and you need to read it again before writing. Dividing a large review into several sessions would be very helpful to ease the pressure. (My professor actually provided me with an outline of the review and even the expected finishing time for each section, but sadly I didn't follow it...) And the third suggestion would be -- interact and consult with your supervisor actively as they may be more willing to help and less terrifying than you imagined.",

I don't know how others will feel about this but I was fine with the workload. <br /><br />The final report submission and presentation might overlap with your preparation for your final exams so work ahead and study diligently.<br /><br />To add more to the presentation, you'll be presenting your research topic in front of professors and students. Don't be panicked about this, just be yourself, also you need to make ppt simple and concise enough for others to understand your topic as well.<br /><br />&quot;If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough&quot; <br />-Albert Einstein",
