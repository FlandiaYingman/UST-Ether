Introduces us through the fundamental concepts of valuation principle, time value of money, investment decision rules, financial statement analysis, capital budgeting, bonds and stocks valuation, and risk/return analysis.<br /><br />The course content is quite conceptually demanding at first and may make u muddle-headed for quite a bit of time, but after a while u may grasp the concepts better. You may wish to be noted that this course is quantitative and involves quite a lot of formulas. Those who are good at maths can grasp the content more easily.<br /><br />♦ Introduction to Corporate Finance<br />♦ Valuation Principle<br />♦ Time Value of Money<br />♦ Valuation of Cash Flow Streams<br />♦ Interest Rates<br />♦ Investment Decision Rules<br />♠ Financial Statement Analysis<br />♠ Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting<br />♦ Bonds<br />♦ Stock Valuation<br />♣️ Risk and Return<br />♣️ Systematic Risk and Equity Risk Premium<br />♦ Cost of Capital<br /><br />♠ Accounting knowledge needed<br />♣️ Statistics knowledge needed<br /><br />⚠ Unlike the SBM version of this course (FINA2303), ACCT2010 and ISOM2500 are not explicitly written as prerequisites of this course. However, don't be fooled by such description. This course is actually equivalent to FINA2303 in terms of content and the set of exam papers used, and basic accounting and statistics backgrounds are still crucial to the understanding of the course content. DON'T take this course if you don't haven't learnt these previously, or you'll definitely suffer.",

One of my friends got slightly below mean in both of them and still managed to get a B. Prof. Pi's grading seems very lenient.<br /><br />⚠ But beware that this course might be even more competitive than FINA2303, in which SBM students already work very hard for the major selection process. FYI at my time the midterm mean in FINA2203 was 5 marks higher than FINA2303, and the final mean was 10 marks higher as well. Seems that non-SBM students mostly do better in this kind of quantitative courses.",

However, you will be suffering a lot if you don't have any Accounting background.",
            "comment_teaching": "This semester we are having different approach. There will be a routine work for each week: Textbook readings -&gt; VOS (voice-over slides) -&gt; ICA (in-class activity) -&gt; Lesson -&gt; mini-quiz. We have one lesson only every week.<br /><br />Textbook reading: I don't know it is my problem or not, the textbook is quite difficult to understand and missing reasoning behind formulas. It is important to read the textbook because his notes will not cover all the materials in the book. (They will be examined!)<br /><br />VOS and lecture notes: Basically VOS&nbsp;&nbsp;goes through the set of lecture notes for that week. VOS is fine but the lecture notes design is horrible. I do think these notes are made in 1990s. There is no layout, a bunch of irrelevant graphics and &quot;colourful&quot; content. How colourful is that? In week2 material, there couple of slides taking about all the formulas for the ratios. First it is overwhelming. Second, everything is squeeze in one page like it costs him 1million to insert a new slide. (Those formulas are NOT important!)<br />ALSO HE LOVES SHORT FORM SO MUCH. Let's play a game if you have studied ACCT2010:<br />Q1: what RV stands for? (Revenue, easy)<br />Q2: what TX stands for? (Tax)<br />Q3: what is INT??? (not integer! but interest expense! maybe you will mess up this one with inventory?)<br />Confusing right?<br />The first few weeks are all like this :)<br />Even I got an A in Acct2010, I still suffer from all these mess,<br /><br />Regular lesson: Something quite nice about this prof is that he plans to have a Portfolio Management Game (PMG) that allows everyone to invest in different stocks in the real world and earn GameCoins. Options like shorting are allowed which is quite fascinating. Every lesson, he will spend some time reviewing the trend of this week. During Chinese New Year he even gives out LaiSee/chocolate coin to the best players or the one actively answering questions. Quite Nice.<br />There will be an In Class Activity every week and most of them are either case analysis to this week's topic or illustrate some important points in VOS/lecture notes. Overall it is quite good to have his lessons. There will be some IPRS questions for students to win GameCoin for PMG. So no attendance is required.<br /><br />Mini-quiz: usually mini-quiz consists of basic question or some IPRS question of that week. You will start feeling that some questions are hard to answer, and that is the most difficult part of this course, students admitted to this course are coming from other school like taking business minor or majoring in MAEC/MATH SF track. The math in this course is super easy for us. Therefore, Prof loves those &quot;concept&quot; questions rather than computation. (TA said this)<br /><br />TA Kenrick is helpful. For those local students who have no accounting background. Attend the optional tutorial and ask Kenrick in Cantonese. The first few chapters will definitely destroy your passion in this course.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading scheme and my grade will be updated later.<br />The main purpose I am writing this review is to say something about this &quot;COPY2203&quot; course.<br />In midterm and final exam, we are having more than enough time to finish 30(midterm) and 40(final) questions. Most of them are T/F or M/C. Both open-book, open-notes and we can access any lecture material in canvas.<br />AND THIS IS A LOTTERY GAME!<br />I think he has a &quot;big&quot; question banks that collect so many questions in each topic. When we are doing mini-quizzes, everyone got different sets of questions (reasonable). AND THERE IS A CHANCE THAT YOUR QUESTION APPEARS IN EXAM AGAIN!<br />What is more interesting is that prof will give an mock midterm/final that consists of the same format as the real exam (guess he is just randomly picking questions from his question bank). If you are lucky enough, you can see those questions appears again in your exams. Therefore, it is like playing a lottery. (sometimes the numerical parameters are the same, sometimes different.)<br /><br />That make both midterm and final become &quot;Answer searching competition&quot; or &quot;how lucky I am&quot; competition or &quot;Can I find this on textbook&quot; competition. I don't know what I have learnt from this course.<br />----Update----<br />Mini-Quiz 12% (best 8 out of 12)<br />HW 20% (best 4 out of 5)<br />Midterm 28%<br />Final 40%<br />Total (me) : 93.9/100<br />Final Grade: A<br />Pretty good grade. Achieving A+ is extremely hard (have to be flawless)<br />But once again, even I got an A in this course, I can't tell what did I learn.",

He often tries to arouse students’ interest in finance. He likes to spend around 15 minutes to discuss some financial news at the beginning of the lectures. But I think he spent a little bit too much time on discussing financial news. (That’s why the coverage of the quiz was slightly different from the one stated in the syllabus.) Lecture videos are provided.<br /><br />Tutorials are optional, but they are exam-oriented. Vincent (TA) explains the concepts really well. Attending all tutorials is highly recommended.",

            "comment_workload": "PRS: Unless you decided to give up the 2% PRS scores, don’t skip lectures even though lecture videos are provided. In this semester, only 6 lectures (after the add/drop period) out of all 23 lectures had PRS sessions. (PRS questions before the add/drop period will not count.) For each PRS session, 2-4 questions will be asked and you will be given 2-3 minutes to answer each question. A total of 19 PRS questions were asked in this semester. The questions are quite challenging. If you miss one PRS session, it would be quite difficult for you to catch up the PRS scores afterwards. Remember to save the PRS questions using the screenshot function of your phone, as these PRS questions are quite useful for your future revision.<br /><br />MFL Homework: You have to buy the textbook for the access code for the MFL Homework. You have 2 attempts for each question. Try out similar questions on MFL before submitting your homework. The thing I really appreciate is that no homework was due in the midterm break.<br /><br />Quiz and exams: Going through all tutorial questions and PRS questions is suggested. (I found that a few questions in the quiz had the same style as the PRS questions, see attachment.) If you have time, practice more on MFL. Most questions will require calculations. Formula sheet will be provided (see the 3 attachments). You don’t have to memorize most of the formulas except those in chapter 2.

The grading is as follows: midterm1: 22%<br />+midterm2: 30%+final30%+HW15%+participation3%<br />i can't quite remember how the professor finally assign the grade,(maybe curving) but it's not so good from my friends' opinion.<br />Generally I think the grading is fair and the grade is&nbsp;&nbsp;not so hard.",
            "comment_workload": "I would suggest to read the chapters in the textbooks thoroughly, before the scheduled class. And there will also be questions in exam to include book knowledge, which are not mentioned in the class. Reading the book takes most of my time on this course. The workload is not so big if you treat it as kind of a 'major' course, but not merely a CCC.",

These 11 chapters come from textbook 'Corporate Finance: Core Principles and Applications (6th edition)', it is a must to buy it cuz you gonna do homework in it's connect system.<br /><br />This course basically teaches you how to read balance sheet and income statement, how to extract info from these statements, the concept of Cash Flow, stocks and bonds, to see how a much a company worth, how money depreciate as time gone by (most important concept through the course!), how to buy stocks etc. You'll encounter a lot of calculation stuff + conceptual stuff. Good news: chapters are coherent so you can consolidate your learning as you work through it.<br /><br />Here's the outline:<br />Week 1: chapter 1: Introduction to Corporate Finance<br /><br />Week 2: Chapter 3: Financial Statement Analysis &amp; Financial Models <br /><br />Week 3: Chapter 2: Financial Statements &amp; Cash Flow <br /><br />Week 4: Chapter 4: Discounted Cash Flow Valuation<br /><br />Week 5: Chapter 4: Discounted Cash Flow Valuation<br /><br />Week 6: Chapter 5: Interest Rates and Bond Valuation<br /><br />Week 7: Midterm (21/3)<br /><br />Week 8: Chapter 6: Stock Valuation<br /><br />Week 9: Chapter 7: Net Present Value and Other Investment Rules<br /><br />Week 10: Chapter 8: Making Capital Investment Decisions<br /><br />Week 11: Midterm break<br /><br />Week 12: Chapter 11: Return and Risk: The Capital Asset Pricing Model<br /><br />Week 13: Chapter 12: Risk, Cost of Capital, and Capital Budgeting<br /><br />Final Exam (23/5)<br /><br />By the way, besides ordinary lecture stuff, they also provided a 'game': Portfolio Management Game. It is just a stock market simulation, if you buy good stocks, you'll earn game coins. Besides, doing good in weekly quizzes and in-class polling iPRS can also increase game coins.<br /><br />Game coins can in turn help you with you your mini quizzes result if you earn a lot of it. (Yes! So if you do well in mini quizzes, you earn more game coins, more game coins help you do better in mini quizzes, positive cycle!)",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Mackay is actually pretty good I think. At the beginning of the semester I was not adapted to his voice (felt kind of sleepy and boring) but things got better as time went on.<br /><br />He's very familiar and professional with his lecture content and he's welcome to any question during classes.",
            "comment_grading": "Surprisingly good grading in such a competitive course, I got A+ eventually.<br /><br />Grading structure:<br />12%-Weekly mini-quizzes (can be improved by Portfolio Management Game result)<br />20%-5 Homework Assignments<br />28%-Midterm Exam<br />40%-Final Exam (cumulative, all course material will be covered)<br /><br />I got:<br />8.532% in Weekly mini-quizzes (mean 4.374%, highest 10.296%)<br />20% in Homework<br />28% in Midterm Exam<br />37% in Final Exam<br />Overall: 93.532% A+<br /><br />I start to learn it from nothing in mind, I didn't even know what 'securities' means before studying this course. However, I did spend a lot of time in it, I almost took every lecture and followed the pace.",
            "comment_workload": "Be honest, this course is kind of busy. <br /><br />First, you'll have to do 5 homework throughout the course. <br /><br />Second, you'll have to do 1 mini quiz every week! (which takes you several mins for each quiz but you better prepare it before doing it!)<br /><br />Third, the busiest part is, he didn't actually explain lecture ppt during classes! He pre-released lecture recording before each class, and you gonna watch it on your own in Canvas! Then what were being done during class? In-class Activities!<br /><br />However, since during in-class activities, there would be several iPRS questions, I suggest you to attend every lecture to ans iPRS Qs as many as possible. Because they help you earn game coins as mentioned previously.<br /><br />On the other hand, in order to get better understanding of his lecture ppts, reading textbook is also a good approach.",

            "comment_content": "The content is quite comprehensive. It really gives you a clear insight of what is the basic things you should know about finance. For the one who has a little background on business courses for instance taken Acct 2010 etc, they will have a little advantage and this advantage can support them up to the midterm exam. But after mid-term, the difficulties will increase explicitly. Note that this course is not just memorizing the formula and use it, cases are as important as the formula because for both mid-term and final, many questions will come out from the cases which have been taught in the lecture, so don't neglect them. And also if given video to watch for the entire lecture, pay attention to it as questions in the exam will come out from them.",
            "comment_teaching": "Before attending lectures, do a rough pre-study about the material is quite useful as the way of teaching is like a flow, the instructor pay much time on talking about the case and when it is the part of formula, he just simply go through it quickly without much explanation. His teaching may a bit boring but I never slept in his class but other classes. Prof is quite knowledgeable. His teaching is quite smooth but a bit fast.",
