            "comment_teaching": "Her teaching is one of the best I have seen in the SOSC department. She makes sure everyone follows the tutorial sessions, and thoroughly answers all the questions students ask. <br /><br />I don't think attendance is necessary because all of the materials are inside the presentation slides. But because it's a small class, the Professor will remember who comes and does not come to classes. <br /><br />If you want a good grade, visit her office at least once every week to get help on the assignment or advice on the project (Unfortunately, the TA is very cautious about helping students on assignments and projects, so the Professor is more helpful).<br /><br />For midterms, concentrate on centrality measures. <br />For finals, make sure you understand all slides on ERGMs. (I didn't focus on ERGMs and had difficult time in the final questions...)",

            "comment_workload": "Overall, the course has mediocre workload, but it is manageable. The course has a midterm and final exam, five assignments (may be more for future classes), and a project. <br /><br />[Assignment]<br />The biggest problem is that the assignments are handed out on Tuesday and you have to submit the assignment on Friday of the same week. The lecture sessions were on Wednesdays so you only have two full days to complete the assignment. <br /><br />The assignment is meant to take 1-2 hours, but it should take at least 3 hours to get an acceptable grade in the assignment. It is not very difficult but it does take some time to figure out the right answers. <br /><br />[Project (2 person group, but can ask for expansion)]<br />The project is a poster project where you have to make a poster and present (with a separate presentation) your research in 10 minutes. The grading is quite lenient, but you should meet with the professor to confirm if what you are doing is what she wants. She will give good scores if you accept her advice. <br /><br />[Reading] <br />She assigns readings (not always, 4 chapters over the semester), but the reading material are not covered in the exams. It is only for your understanding. You may choose not to do it.",

And asshole TA will always find minuscule excuses to deduct marks on your answers. The assignment will be released to you on Tuesday, but really, you can only get started on it Wednesday because the materials you need to know how to complete the assignment will be taught in Wednesday's lab lecture. And assignments are always due on Friday, which gives you a whole 48 hours to complete the assignment. How humanizing. Better yet, this happens every single week except the week of midterm. So you complete 10 or 11 assignments in total throughout the semester. <br /><br />For the group project, my team and I pulled around 4 all nighters in total. There were multiple components, you have to do - make a poster in which first you hand in to receive feedback and then you hand in for a grade. And you also give a presentation. The project is absolute anal because you won't know what is going on most of the time as very guidance is given. And don't forget, toward the end of the semester, while you painstakingly work on the poster which you have no clue wtf is going on, you still need to spare 7-8 hours on the assignments. <br /><br />All of this is excluding a midterm and a final",
