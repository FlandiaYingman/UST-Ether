            "comment_content": "Course Goals and Objectives<br />• Understand generic programming language concepts in R<br />• Know how to obtain data from a variety of sources and tidy data for downstream analysis tasks<br />with R<br />• Understand the basic principles of constructing data graphics and be familiarized with the plotting<br />systems and visualization features in R<br />• Understand how to write R scripts and use various R packages for business applications<br />• Use R Markdown to write reports that include R code and the code’s automatically-generated output<br /><br />Before midterm, Jia Jia will teach you some simple programming stuff like data type, flow controls, functions, loops... Some additional stuff would be scoping rules, environments, and the apply family. <br /><br />After midterm, the focuses are on data visualization with ggplot and some classes on text analytics.<br /><br />This course is useful especially when you know that in the future your boss will only look at how you tell the story of data, which means data visualization is important. Also, web scrapping skills and text analytics techniques are useful skills.<br /><br />Some people maybe wonder whether they should the R or Python. To be honest, I think python would be better but since the python course ISOM3400 is designed for beginners, it might not carry everything necessary for data analysis purpose. So I will recommend taking R if you want to further expand your knowledge in the data analysis aspect.",
            "comment_teaching": "It might be a little bit hard to understand Jia Jia's English... To understand what he says, first you need to know what he gonna say... Like some terms if you haven't heard of that before, you can hardly know he is referring to that.<br /><br />For the course, he tries to elaborate a lot on the fundamentals of programming as he knows most IS students don't quite know how to code. This would be friendly to most of the students but maybe just not me. <br /><br />Initially, most students attended the class. Yet, as there are no final exam, only me and another student attended class after midterm exam.<br /><br />Charles is helpful during the lab session, you can essentially ask him anything and since the class size is quite small, it's quite chill.",
            "comment_grading": "The grade breakdown is as follows:<br />• Lab participation: 10%<br />• Homework (4): 40%<br />• Midterm quiz: 25%<br />• Final project: 25% (10% out of 25% will be based on your team-mates’ assessment of your<br />contribution)<br /><br />The grade is pretty good. Since there is no final exam, midterm will be the major factor determining your grade. Other components should share similar scores. I score 92/100 in midterm and end up getting A+.",
            "comment_workload": "Low workload. 4 homeworks which are just like the lab materials and you don't really need to look at additional information to finish the homework. Though the lab could be hard sometimes and most of the students have to consult the TA Charles to finish the lab including me. So, get a reliable friend or get to be friend with Charles.<br /><br />The project is just a web-scrapping and text analytics project which you should be able to handle with the lecture notes.",

            "comment_teaching": "The course was taught by one of the PhD students, QIAN, Bingjie, and she was quite good as she was very clear and approachable.

            "comment_workload": "Even though it was 3hr lectures + 1hr labs Mon, Wed, and Fri, if you are confident in your programming skills, the workload is very light, as the in-class and lab exercises can be done just by looking at/copying from the lecture videos and the assignments and project are only a few hours of work. I was able to easily handle it while doing a full-time internship.<br /><br />If you aren't confident in your programming skills, then this course might take a lot of your time since it is very rushed during the summer semester.<br /><br />Also, the prerequisites can be waived (I haven't actually taken any of them).",

Might also be harsh absolute grading but regardless, it's just a bad grade course. <br /> <br />This is the worst grade programming course offered in business school that I have taken.
