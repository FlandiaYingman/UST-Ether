It introduces topics like Wilcoxon sign rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, robust statistics, etc. Some of the methods are developed by prof himself, so try not to skip lessons. The content is easy anyway.",
            "comment_teaching": "Highly recommend NOT to skip lessons.<br /><br />I kinda like the prof, he is really nice, though not good at teaching. He is willing to answer your questions, but you may not understand his explaining. This course involves a bunch of proofs during the lessons. And the MOST important thing is, the proofs in the notes are NOT complete!!!! You have to listen to his explanation (though I felt like those are some dirty proofs). I wrote down the whole proof from the lecture notes in the final exam, and the TA said the proof is not complete, without telling me what the answer should be, and deduced half of marks for the question!",
            "comment_grading": "It takes attendance since the add-drop period is ended.<br />I believe it is a good grading course.

The TA had deduced 20 marks for my midterm just because I got two wrong answers with correct steps (minus 10 per question). She simply ignored all the step you have written, and looked at your answer straightly.",

            "comment_teaching": "In my opinion, his teaching is quite crap.<br />* His way of teaching: Just reading out contents from power point. All theorems from lecture notes are proved in-class. But the main problem is with his intonation and handwriting style; his English is not so good, so I can hardly understand what he's talking about. Also, I found his handwriting to be very hard to be read. So, in the end, I have to rely on other sources of learning to understand all the chapters. <br />* Teaching pace: Very very slow. All details from lecture notes are explained, which is actually good, but then the problem is with his intonation and handwriting. Oh, one more thing, no lecture video before classes were cancelled.<br />* Tutorials: Very useful, but it's your choice to attend it. I myself find it quite useful, but tutorial notes are emailed to us only few days before the exams.",

Assignments 1-3 contain 3 questions each, quite straight forward; follow tutorial notes and lecture notes closely. Deadlines are one week after the release of each assignment.<br />2. Assignment 4 is assigned after the classes were cancelled. It contains 7 questions (so f**king many) and only 5 days is given to complete it. In addition, each question is quite tedious, adding pain to us.<br />3. The midterm exam is not so hard, but definitely not easy. It contains 4 questions and we are given 80 minutes to finish it. You are allowed (and definitely necessary) to bring any tables into the exam (e.g. U table and Wilcoxon T-table). Coverage of exam is from Sign Test to Location Shift Model (Chapter 2 to 3).<br />4. There is 1 proof question in the midterm.<br />5. Final exam is non-cumulative. Coverage from Chapter 4 to Chapter 8. Feel free to see the questions in the attachment. The questions are given out via email at around 11:55 AM, and you need to submit the solution via email before 5 PM.",
