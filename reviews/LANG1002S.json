Peer evaluation is useful, but what it is required that interactions must be involved in the evaluation. With the high frequency that around two lesson there will be such a work in class or as after-class work, the problem is that we cannot find what can we interact soon.<br /><br />Although we could still endure the embarrassment brought by the above problem, the teaching style of her was mainly following the activities from the notes on canvas, and adding some own activities. This is not a problem, but the problem is that these activities (and the peer evaluation activities mentioned above), were making up every minute of the class time. As a result, she only told us the deal date of the class, and without any further information. What we got were only information from canvas, and without any kind of information about how we can do better in these assessments. I heard that other classes will even teach how you can get better marks. So......when you still have choice, I strongly recommend you switch the tutor (if you find that you are in this class)",

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.<br />The course is graded and carries three credits.<br /><br />You may get started by clicking a link below.",

The second speaking test is closed to the Game Changer. <br />Writing Assessments: Two assessments are related. Unit 2 mainly tells you how to write an essay about a Game Changer.<br />Ivan also calculate the attendance and participation.<br /><br />The overall aim of this class is fairly reasonable and considerate. You can really learn something from it, like public speaking, how to write an essay, etc. Though the structure required for the essay is kind of stupid and boring, your tutor will draw your attention to your logic and ways of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;This course particularly stresses the importance of citation.

There is no use in sending emails and complain about your final grade, they would just blame on the computer system. <br /><br />Each lecturer's class tends to have a grade trend. My case, Anita Cheung's students tend to get lower grades even our coursework scores are higher than other classes. (I got a B- and my classmates got C range, other S classes could get A to B range, despite there are not much difference in our coursework scores.)<br /><br />My advice, choose an experienced and generally well-known lecturer, their class might have better grades overall.",

If it passed the deadline, you cannot submit anymore. <br /><br />Overall, this is one of the most annoying with heavy workload course, despite most of the things are useless at the first place.",

My friend shared a similar score from most of the assignments with me, but he got B for the final grade, and he is also in S class. I think the grade is relatively related to your impression in the instructor's mind.

S stands for standard, this course is for DSEers with 3/4 in English.<br /><br />The book is pretty useless, costing about $300, yet only using it for about 5 to 6 lessons. Our instructors put all the resources needed online (canvas website). You don't need the book for the homework. Marking schemes are provided with the homework file or on canvas.<br /><br />You are expected to attend all the classes provided. <br />In this term, you are allowed to skip for a maximum of 5 lessons. However, you can do some self-learning to waive your absence (even I've never tried so).<br /><br />The two themes this semester: Possibility Mindset and Game Changer<br /><br />To be honest, the skills taught in the official scheme are basic and you don't have to worry about catching up the classes IF your instructor is teaching according to the book.",

The first writing is linked with the Library lesson (it is called LIBA2019 and you need to book for the lesson), and the second writing is linked to the 1st writing. So you need to do your best starting from the first task possible.<br /><br />Vocabs are provided in the tests, so don't worry too much as long as you can remember the meanings of the vocabulary.<br /><br />But out of that, the workload depends on your instructor(s).

Just complete the sentence with the required words.<br />Speaking tests: The first speaking test mainly focus on our ability to tell a story. You need to upload a 3.5-4min speech video. The second speaking test is closed to the Game Changer.<br />Writing Assessments: Two assessments are related. Unit 2 mainly tells you how to write an essay about a Game Changer.<br />Ivan also calculate the attendance and participation.<br /><br />The overall aim of this class is fairly reasonable and considerate. You can really learn something from it, like public speaking, how to write an essay, etc. Though the structure required for the essay is kind of stupid and boring, your tutor will draw your attention to your logic and ways of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;This course particularly stresses the importance of citation. A library workshop is required and you need to complete a quiz after this workshop.",

            "comment_content": "LANG1002 is a task-based, integrated-skills, English language course developed for first year students. It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />On this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organized way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.<br />The course is graded and carries three credits.",

You definitely need to spend some time on your assignments in fact, and I believe the more time you spent on preparing, checking and proofreading, the better results you will get.<br /><br />If you really want to perform well and get a good grade in LANG 1002, you need to work harder e.g. read more English articles and books, speak English more and do those out-of-class work if possible.",

An essay with 600-800 words mentioning a game-changer, answering three questions,<br />1. why it is a game changer <br />2. The conditions making it to be a game-changer<br />3. The impacts brought by the game-changer <br />Require the use of adequate sources and academic wordings, as well as to write in a logical and structured manner. Quite difficult and heavy. Need to hand in at the end of Week 11. <br /><br />Second speaking assessed task <br />Talk about the game changer you have written for the writing task, a in-class speech spending around four minutes. Try to speak in a casual and catchy way, with the use of attention grabber and hooks, and deliver your ideas clearly and fluently. <br /><br />Attendance and Participation Mark <br />I think you just need to attend all classes and give some useful responses to the class to get the basic marks.

For example, group writing, story telling with peer evaluation, video viewing and many more... Sometimes, she told us some of her own personal experience which is relevant to the topic. Most of them are quite interesting and funny. <br /><br />She tend to be very efficient, she cover all the points that is important then she will let us leave. Although not following the textbook strictly, she did cover all the important points with a good logical flow. In fact, I want the lesson to be longer because I really did learn things......<br /><br />Sorry for this lengthy review but I have to give credits that she put effort in giving us feedback. She gives out lots of chance to practice our speaking and writing skills in class, and she did give comments and suggestions to most of them. Before the 2nd speaking task, she even held a (optional) practice session to give us detailed personal feedback on part of our speech. She also gives useful suggestion for improving our English (like shadowing, find a speaker and try to speak like him/her).

Coming in the classroom 5 minutes late and letting us leave 15 minutes early is the usual practice for every class. Like he doesn't even bother to teach. A classmate even said that he doesn't reply to his email regarding the writing assessment. Like seriously?He didn't teach us at all on how to complete our assessed tasks, just simply told us to refer back to the guidelines and marking scheme. Then what is his purpose? I haven't met a teacher that &quot;hea&quot; throughout my life and he really broadens my horizons and redefines &quot;hea&quot;.",
            "comment_grading": "I am not quite sure about his grading methods cause it is completely irrational and doesn't seem to grade along with your aptitude. It is almost like you are in a mark six and the first two balls that you roll is your grade. For the first writing assessment, he gives 2 and 3 in two domains with 7 and 7 as full marks. What??? 2 and 3? I am not illiterate! While other teachers are giving 6s and 7s for homework that was done on the day of submission, I was getting 2 and 3 for a homework that i drill on for 2 days. Wow! When I ask him why i got this marks, he simply replies that cause according to the marking scheme, I think you deserve this mark without any further explanation. And when me and my classmates compared our work, we find out that the assignment that was done with minimum effort gets the highest mark. So good luck if you are enrolled in his class, expect to have low grades and expect that your marks are not proportional to your aptitude. I am expecting a C with his &quot;excellent&quot; grading. By the way, the normal grading for these kinds of tasks are 5 for normal people and 6 and 7 for smart ones. My friend who get level 3 in English managed to get 5s and 6s for all tasks with a different tutor. For grade's sake, swap to another tutor. But if you just want to &quot;hea&quot;, then he is the perfect tutor for you.",
            "comment_workload": "Totally 4 assessed tasks of extremely poor grading from our great non-subjective tutor. 2 speaking tasks, 2 writing tasks and two vocab tests in total. Expect getting 3s and 4s so you won't be surprised when you receive your marks. And perhaps study for vocab test, as it is the only assessment that can be judged without bias, although it won't affect much since the majority of the grade comes from the writing and speaking assessed tasks. Got 34/40 for vocab test but got 2 and 3 out of two 7s in assessed tasks shows you how objective the grading is. Please swap to other tutors if you are that unlucky to have him teaching for your 1002S class.",

The speech is recorded by yourself and uploaded to canvas. On the other hand, the 2nd one is about a game changer you chose to write about in the writing tasks.

I really enjoy his teaching style and his British accent (He has lived in the UK for about 20 years before returning to HK if I remember that correct).<br /><br />Every time you step into classroom, he always arrange the seats in a U shape arrangement as he always require us to talk to each other in pair during the class for discussion. I love to talk to my classmates very much as this helps to make the atmosphere more relaxing.<br /><br />He also answers my questions clearly.

But when you compared the workload of this course to that in secondary school, the burden of LANG1002S is still definitely more lighter.<br /><br />The before class preparation is the most annoying thing to do in this course. You need to do all of them if you want to get good grade. Sometimes the preparation can be time-consuming, but it can also be done in under 20 minutes.<br /><br />Plus, the diary, the assessed discussion and the PAPA are also the major workload in this course. Please make sure that you are well-prepared before doing them. Otherwise, you will get low marks.",

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />On this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.",

For John, he likes to ask students to be co-host during the class, DO IT! it makes him see your will and effort in practicing oral English.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for the essay and speech, you really should start way before ddl, not starting the day before due. When you prepare for it, you can ask questions to let the instructor see your effort. To be honest, I really think I prepared a lot for the sppech and essay. <br /><br />(eventually all 6/7 for speech and essay and full marks for everything else, ended up with A+) <br /><br />So make sure your instructor sees your effort, make him remember you. Because comparing to other courses, Lang really depends on the impression you left to the instructor. So it's really important to leave a good impression.",

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.",

This is an EAP course with a primary focus on language development and proficiency. The course also supports students with academic literacy skills.

However, people in CLE are very good at giving you a promising overview/overall structure of the course, but then provide little to no solid instructions, advices, etc. that actually serve the purposes they've claimed. The student notes posted on Canvas aren't that conducive as well. Just for a brief example, in U2L1 notes, they listed expressions such as &quot;I think&quot; ,&quot;I guess&quot; and &quot;In my opinion&quot; and consider them &quot;useful phrases&quot; to be used in discussions. These ARE indeed usual expressions in colloquial conversations, but why bother listing these phrases that's familiar to almost everyone and call them &quot;useful&quot; ones? It gives me the feeling that they just don't feel like actually teaching students substatial communication skills, and payed nothing more than perfuctory efforts in making notes and slides.",
            "comment_teaching": "My instructor is CHAN, Ka Long Roy.<br />He is kind enough to offer students help, and will reaily answer students' questions both via email and in person. Regarding the course subjects, I can tell that he had his personal insights, it's just the boring slides and barely usable notes that constraints his teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is, without exaggerating, arbitrary, in the sense of a subjective marking scheme and the fact that they'd distribute letter grade with a fixed proportion, rather than referring to absolute grade.<br />Self directed learning - 15%<br />Discussion skills - 20% <br />Reflective diary - 25% <br />Presenting alternative perspectives assessment - 40%<br />As you can see, since there's no exams or dictations, your grades relies solely on the judement of your instructor, which may well be subjective, if not biased. The curving scheme also adds up to the uncertainty, granting some 3 A ranges(usually A-) and dozens of Bs and Cs in a Tutorial section.<br />So the bottomline here is: a) go take your TOEFL or IELTS and have the 3 credit transferred; b) if a) fails, try as best as you can to ingratiate yourself with the instructor, so that you may leave a good impression on him/her and earn a passing grade.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is pretty huge, since the before-class online assignments(the SDLs) are required, which are, again, boring and time-consuming. Other assignments and projects, such as the PAPA, also takes up tons of time and efforts. <br />Overall, I'm totally disappointed that the course failed to reach both students and the coordinator's expectations, and sincerely look forward to some changes(though not likely) in the preparing, teaching, and grading scheme of LANG1002S.",

It is the subject that I spent most time on but only getting B-. So really don't struggle! For your reference, I got a gpa of 3.7, so I definitely suggest you to give up this sheety course, it will not have a great difference on your grade whether u give up or not.

            "comment_content": "Course Description<br />LANG1002S is a task-based, integrated-skills, English language course developed for first year students. It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence – e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically – necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education.<br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course project will help you to develop these further.<br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002S is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.<br />The course is graded and carries three credits.<br /><br />Important note:<br /><br />Students will be pre-registered into LANG1002A / LANG1002S / LANG1002I based on their English proficiency upon admission to HKUST. This is the course which students must take in order to complete their graduation requirements. Putting students of a similar proficiency level in the same class makes it possible for teachers to focus lessons better and help students achieve targets set for the end of their Year One studies. Students who would like to know more about placement in a LANG 1002 class should contact Dr. Li Po Lung (E-mail: lcstdadvice@ust.hk).<br /><br />Intended learning outcomes<br />Intended Learning Outcomes<br /><br />Graduate attributes: By the end of this semester, students will be able to…<br /><br />Vocabulary<br /><br />Understand and use a range of vocabulary and expressions that are commonly used in general English and in academic discussions.<br />Critical thinking and reading skills<br /><br />Select, read and evaluate a variety of texts, including scholarly writing, to develop understanding of a complex topic.<br />Select appropriate information for a specific audience and purpose.<br />Distinguish key points from details in order to summarise information for a specific audience and purpose.<br />Writing skills<br /><br />Plan, research and structure a piece of writing according to the needs of a specific reader and purpose.<br />Write a series of coherent and cohesive paragraphs, in which topic sentences containing controlling ideas are expanded with details, examples and explanations.<br />Write a short, expository essay, using explanation, justification, description, and analysis.<br />Paraphrase sentences from sources to support ideas and claims; and appropriately acknowledge the sources.<br />Speaking skills<br /><br />Speak about a topic for at least two minutes.<br />Make an oral summary.<br />Deliver a speech-with-a-story, sharing thoughts and giving advice.<br />Deliver a speech using speculation, explanation, and analysis.<br />Pronounce sounds clearly and use rhythm appropriately and persuasively.<br />Competency- building<br /><br />Collaborate with others in discussions to achieve specific outcomes.<br />Leadership and teamwork<br /><br />Demonstrate understanding of the impact of an idea on lives.<br />International outlook<br /><br />Demonstrate the ability to use appropriate strategies, tools and resources to develop language proficiency and academic literacy.<br />Vision and orientation to the future",
