It wasnt until the end of the semester that the teacher modified the assessment scheme (previously only midterm and final are counted toward the final grade) into 1 assignment, 1 quiz and 1 final. I didnt start to try to catch up with the lesson until the first deadline approached (which was only 10 days away from final and already way too late) and it was horrible to have to cram for everything from scratch. Strongly advisable to follow the teacher and do the exercise on time. They could have done me great good if I did all of them..",

But this course is better than CHEM2110 at least you have a sample midterm with solution. Other than that, all you have is the numerous textbook questions for you to do.<br /><br />The examination mode is WAY BETTER than CHEM2110. There are MCs, short questions (fill in the product of given reaction etc), mechanism, spectroscopy and synthesis design. You still have chances to get some marks at MC if you are students like me who knows nothing about synthesis design. :)",

Meaning that you will need to remember all these reactions. Moreover, he does not allow you to go back to the previous questions during midterm and final... which is very annoying as you have to manage your time well.",

            "comment_teaching": "The course is delivered by two professors, prof. Sun and prof. Hugh.<br /><br />Professor Sun's lecture is a bit slow-paced, so sometimes it can be boring but he covers all the essential parts quite well. As the pace is slow, you have enough time to digest all the course contents.<br /><br />Professor Hugh's lecture is somewhat fast-paced. He seems very enthusiastic about his research and teaching. Overall, not bad. However, he spends quite some time explaining total synthesis examples which I personally think is a bit waste of time as the examples are way too complicated for the undergraduate level, and most of all, not related to the exams. <br /><br />Both professors have exclusive ppt slides (mainly example questions) which can be only seen in class. These slides are important in preparing for the exams so don't miss them.",

The deviation shouldn't be that high because the exam was not that hard, much easy and merciful compared to the infamous organic chem I course. <br />Anyways, the data shows that the students are divided largely into two groups, ones are very good at org chem, and ones are very bad at org chem. If you want to get a good grade, you need to excel in this course, as you are competing with superb students for the A range.",

The hard part would be the contents covering from chapter 12 to chapter 14 (spectroscopy). If you are first to spectroscopy, you might need to spend some time and get used to solving problems of these kinds. <br /><br />Don't try to cram everything in the end.
