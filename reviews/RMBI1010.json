Give real life examples. Please don't give technical things since she seems do not like (that is the mistake that I have made). Since she studies computer science, she seems not care how fancy your ppt is. But the flow and structure and presentation will be important. There are bonus point if you raise/ask questions in Q&amp;A. Prof will really mark down the names. Seems one question one mark. <br /><br />Final exam (40%) 3-hour<br />It is not difficult at all coz the topic tested are general. Specific topics like duration/dollar gap / RAROC /credit scoring/ unexpected loss / Expected shortfall are not asked (which should be asked instead).<br />All questions are short answered with sub questions.<br /><br />Since she did not give me an A+, let me try to recap what is tested (give her a chance to rewrite the whole paper)<br /><br />(If you know who I am, pm me and I can share to you the content)<br /><br />So overall, the question are quite qualitative and require many explanations so I cannot guess the marking scheme easily. The professor emphasize that you don't need to memorize anything word by word and will give marks as long as you have the meaning, but no one knows will that actually happens.<br /><br />Final grade: A only, should be my project sucks",

Nonetheless, even if you are unfamiliar with economic or business vocabulary, you can fully comprehend the material after brief research. This course does have maths in it, but it is nothing extreme and there is a formula sheet given on the exam.",

The first assignment is an individual essay where you have to answer several questions. The second assignment is a group presentation + written report on a certain topic.

There are many types of risks and you will be learning all of them within a very short period of time (because you have a project as well). <br /><br />By the time you are sitting on the desk to study for your finals for RMBI 1010, you realize you don't have time to study everything.

You don't have to attend the tutorial session as well. Just do the work, submit it somewhere else and that is totally fine. <br /><br />There is no merit in being there for the lectures. So if you feel sleepy, just stay in your room, read over the slides and that will be fine. <br /><br />The project is do-able. You have to do it with another person or with two extra-people.
