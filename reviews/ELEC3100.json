        "description": "The course provides a comprehensive overview of signal processing and communications using quantitative modeling and analysis. Topics include: 7 layer communications model, discrete Fourier transform and z-transform, IIR and FIR filter design techniques and realizations, complexity and implementation considerations of FFT and FIR/IIR, source coding, digital modulation, PSD and spectrum, effects of noise to communication system designs, detection theory, matched filter, signal space and error analysis, channel models and channel coding. Application examples are provided to illustrate on how practical communication systems are designed using these quantitative tools. Design projects are set up so that the students can apply theory learnt in the class to physical problems. MATLAB CAD tools are being used as an integral part of this course.",

It is about lossy source coding like PCM and lossless coding like huffman, arithmetic encoing and LZW algorithm.<br />ch6 is just deeper version of elec 1200 hamming code part except the reed solomon coding.<br />ch7 is a harder and more general version of elec 1200 bit error rate calculation.<br /><br />Things become harder to understand in ch6 reed solomon code and ch7 baseband communication. <br /><br />Therefore this course is a very easy good grade course for those who did very well in elec1200 and elec2100 (A range in both course). As long as you understand the easy stuff very well, it will be enough to get A. ELEC2600 only helps you in the last chapter, ch7 and the first part of ch5.",

Find material for yourself<br /><br />The course provides a comprehensive overview of signal processing and communications using quantitative modeling and analysis. Topics include: 7 layer communications model, discrete Fourier transform and z-transform, IIR and FIR filter design techniques and realizations, complexity and implementation considerations of FFT and FIR/IIR, source coding, digital modulation, PSD and spectrum, effects of noise to communication system designs, detection theory, matched filter, signal space and error analysis, channel models and channel coding. Application examples are provided to illustrate on how practical communication systems are designed using these quantitative tools. Design projects are set up so that the students can apply theory learnt in the class to physical problems. MATLAB CAD tools are being used as an integral part of this course.",
