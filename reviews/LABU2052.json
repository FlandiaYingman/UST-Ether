The program office should just merge the RMBI students into normal LABU courses.<br /><br />This course taught a bunch of useless content that will not apply in reality if you are an RMBI student. For instance, why would I need to write an apology letter to customers if I am not a CS? I don't think most RMBI students will become CS or &quot;公關&quot;. This course has no risk management-related stuff except for financial consulting. However, it is still very qualitative, probably becoz the lecturer is from LC.",

Nothing.<br />- ppt slides with lots of animations and colors<br />- the combination of dark background and light-colored (or even white) words on top<br />- pronouncing keywords wrong (of course it's no good but it will cost you a lot in his class)",
