            "comment_content": "It's about the architecture of 20th to 21st century. The first half of the semester is teaching while the second half is presentation of the Pritzker prize winners across the years. <br /><br />Overall the contents are super simple, enjoyable to learn and listen to. It has raised interest in architecture. If I have time, I would have take this course again.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is very nice and friendly. The lessons are super interactive. She will response and explain to any questions that students raise in the lesson. So don't be shy asking!!!<br /><br />Throughout the whole semester, each group will need to meet her twice for presentation consultation. She provided straight answers and insight ideas to improve the presentation. <br /><br />One thing I found some classmates complaining was her accent is hard to be comfortable with.",
            "comment_grading": "The professor embrace transparency in gradings. She even breakdown the scores of each individuals' in a group presentation. <br /><br />Grade breakdown:<br />25% Project Presentation<br />25% Project Report<br />10% Consultation Meetings<br />20% Classwork (Essay)<br />20% Attendance and comments on peer presentations<br /><br />There's no need to worry the architecture jargons, she looks for your understanding in aesthetic and history of the building more than the professional understanding. <br /><br />Overall the grading is reasonably good. I got mean at the group presentation and above mean for the classwork. I got an A-.",
            "comment_workload": "The main workload for the course is the project presentation, which is relatively easy comparing to other course. <br /><br />As a student who studies two days and works three days a week, the workload is super light. <br /><br />Strongly encourage people who have an interest in architecture to give it a try!!!",

            "comment_content": "It is all about architecture. There will be only half a sem of teaching as the last 5-6 weeks would be used for presentations and the final assignment (classwork essay)<br /><br />The course covers (from syllabus)<br />- Introduction<br />- Architecture of 20th and 21st Architecture<br />- America<br />- Modernism and beyond, in Japan, America, Europe<br />- Postmodernism<br />- Deconstruction and Hi-tech<br />- Critical Regionalism<br />- Recent Trends<br /><br />The presentation architects are all Pritzer Prize laureates, like Leoh Ming Pewi, Norman Foster and Kenzo Tange to name a few. Content taught would be useful for the preparation of project presentations and reports, but of course, more research has to be done.<br /><br />The classwork at the end is basically an in-class essay. You would be given around 1 hour to write on a topic, but you would need to quote from presentations from the prof and the project presentations. <br /><br />I personally quite enjoy the content since I am very interested in architecture, but you can surely go sit in first to see how much are you interested. This course is also not always offered, so I grabbed my chance to study it.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Ngan is a very nice professor and she is very willing to answer emails and questions, or even start a meeting to answer you verbally. She also makes different prizes in the whole course to commemorate efforts. Since the class size is small, she remembers people's names if you attended the class and had consultation meetings with her.<br /><br />However, one &quot;can be better&quot; point is that she is quite fluctuating in her comments, as my group had multiple meetings with her and she had different opinions on the same aspect we asked her (and had opposing views). I also think the previous reviews about her having vague instructions on the project presentation, report and the classwork without any good reference. However, I think it is adequate and it could be figured out eventually, so I did not think it was such big of a problem.",
            "comment_grading": "The grades are very transparent as the professor would release all breakdown of each grade to each component (project report, presentation, final essay) of everyone so you would actually know how you are in the class. From what I observe, most of the class is in A-B range, only a number of people got C-D range. I think the distribution is fair as with the class size.<br /><br />Grade breakdown:<br />25% Project Presentation<br />25% Project Report<br />10% Consultation Meetings<br />20% Classwork (Essay)<br />20% Attendance and comments on peer presentations<br /><br />To clarify, the project itself includes work distribution stated clearly in the report and presentation, and the marks would be given individually. The groups are chosen at the start of the sem, and you choose based on the architect that you want to present. A good group at least could help you get the right direction but if you come without any friends (like me), you just choose one that you are interested in/see any trustworthy people in the group. You have the whole add-drop period to choose the group.",
            "comment_workload": "The main workload is the project presentation, report, and prepping for the classwork. You could read extra readings provided for each lecture, but they are not required. <br /><br />If your project group is the first few ones, you would have a tighter schedule in the middle of the semester since you would need to start working on your presentations and report earlier than others when you still do not have the full idea of how should it looks like. you have one week after the presentation to hand in the report. The earlier groups (Group 1-2) would have bonus marks because of this, and later on, you could rest before revising for the final classwork. That was a perk to me. <br /><br />You need to prepare for 2 consultation meetings for the presentation, and present for 45 minutes (it may even be too little for you). And then you expected to hand in a 15-page report after one week (or two weeks for earlier groups). The classwork is after all presentations, at the last class. It is an open-book essay.<br /><br />I think it all was manageable except that I was in the first few groups so at the middle of the semester it was quite packed for me. Otherwise, it is all good.",
