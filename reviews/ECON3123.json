            "comment_content": "** Syllabus Change After 2021 Fall **<br /><br />Macroeconomics既第一個course。如果你同ECON3113一齊讀呢個course，你會發現呢個course相比下簡單好多。ECON3123係專俾ECOF同MAEC讀，但內容上同ECON2123其實差唔多，只係加加減減小修小補咁。最主要唔同既就係ISLM model係assume LM curve horizontal因為interest rate fully controlled by the Fed。同埋ASAD model用ISLMPC model取代咗，仲有無教open economy，但教咗financial crisis。如果有讀DSE Econ既話，midterm之前應該會有少少幫助，midterm之後就係全新既野。呢個course既數學難極有限，盡其量都係啲equations掉下位咁，但Prof. 有時會發神經，加一堆multivariable calculus去prove野。考試最難都係用first order condition姐，唔洗驚俾NDS屈機。<br /><br />內容：<br />1. Introduction to macroeconomic variables (GDP，inflation果啲野，DSE程度)<br /><br />2. Economy in the short run (講good markets同financial markets，再擺埋一齊搵equilibrium）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Goods market: Keynesian Consumption Model<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. Financial market and monetary policies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. IS-LM model<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4. Extended IS-LM model (real interest rate, risk premium)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5. The 2008 Financial Crisis<br /><br />------------------------midterm--------------------------<br /><br />3. Economy in the medium run (開始複雜，加埋input market，所有野會擺埋一齊）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. Labour market<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2. Phillips Curve, Natural Rate of Unemployment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3. IS-LM-PC model<br /><br />4. Economic Growth (同前面啲野關係唔大，奇奇怪怪咁，要多啲數學，講long run點解會有growth，只有technology先trigger到long-term growth）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1. Facts of Growth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2. Saving, Capital Accumulation, Outputs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3. Technological Progress and Growth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4. Technological Progress, Wages and Unemployment<br /><br />成個course設計上好似由一開始好多assumption再慢慢release啲assumption，例始由price level係fixed變唔fixed。但無好好咁交代清楚，令到成個course好亂好複雜，最後個long run簡直九唔搭八。",
            "comment_teaching": "Lu Yang 講書又無聊又難follow，佢成日會開excel玩數據，播下新聞，但其實啲新聞同數據真係唔知做緊咩，完全follow唔到。教書又照powerpoint讀，有時佢會寫啲mainpoint/教你畫graph 會手寫notes。但都係好混亂。上堂問問題十題有九題佢都答唔到，佢會話呢個唔係佢profession，但我反而覺得係無備課。佢唯一比較好既地方就係佢會帶你由0畫一次graph。佢啲英文以大陸prof.黎講都唔算差既。<br /><br />TA 9成9係astor，最重要既係第一堂tutorial千祈唔好上千祈唔好上，佢係到同你撳啲有macro data既網，完全唔知做緊咩。Lu Yang話過上tutorial係要帶電腦要唔知做data定點，結果第一堂之後無掂過data，真係吹脹。之後嗰啲tutorial就係瘋狂間tutorial notes，無咩作為。但其實佢份notes同exercises都ok，唔想上可以搵人幫手拎notes/拎完就走。",
            "comment_grading": "好靚grade。Prof. 第一堂就講到明會派A range派到最盡最盡，好似話會派30% A range。再加上佢midterm 同 assignment真係派分，大家坐底會有B，勤力多少少就有A range。佢midterm係超容易，但final就幾難下。homework就淨係揀幾條黎check，仲要100分開始倒扣，就算錯晒都應該有9X分。<br /><br />Grading Policy:<br />Homework 10%<br />Midterm 35%<br />Final 55%<br /><br />General Performance:<br />Midterm:<br />Mean: 76.32/100<br />Median: 76/100<br />Standard Deviation: 12.86<br /><br />Final:<br />Mean: 64.49/100<br />Median: 65.5/100<br />Standard Deviation: 16.32<br /><br />My Performance:<br />Homework: 100/100<br />Midterm: 99/100<br />Final: 79/100<br /><br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />Midterm係有溫書就一定識晒，final就唔知搞咩，2條long questons，一堆數同好難既graph drawing。但佢臨尾好似有一條出錯咗，所以所有人都有分定唔知點，總之就亂七八糟。另外astor 改exam都係亂改，有啲位條題目寫得唔好佢都唔會讓步，同一個錯可以唔同人扣唔同分。",

Given that the students are all from MAEC or ECOF, in other words, they are competitive; it's not that easy to get a mean score.",
            "comment_workload": "It's hard to tell the exact workload because different people pursue other goals.<br /><br />There are four assignments throughout the course; each takes less than 3 hours to finish.<br /><br />Some of the assignments require you to use excel to handle the data.<br /><br />If you want to get into A range, following the lectures and doing the assignments are sufficient. But if you are pursuing a more in0-0depth understanding of macroeconomics, I recommend you to read the textbook, which will take approximately 4 hours each week.",
