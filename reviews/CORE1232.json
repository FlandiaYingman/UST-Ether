        "description": "This course teaches concepts and tools for exploring and visualizing data. There are a lot of real-life decision-making problems (e.g., business, logistics, economics, marketing, finance, resource management, forecasting and engineering) which can be formulated using some existing data analysis models. Existing computer science tools such as Microsoft Excel can help us to model and solve these problems easily, and to visualize the solutions.",

Raymond’s responses to my questions are invariably clear, detailed, and easy-understanding. <br /><br />To make the class interesting, Raymond offers some coupon same at that in COMP1942 for those students who pay effort to either finishing the in-class exercise or answering in-class questions raised by him. The use of these coupons are that they can give you automatically full marks in one questions in your assignments, as well as full marks in making the prediction of the final phase of the project.",

            "comment_workload": "As you can see from the grading, there are quite a good few of stuffs to be finished by the end of the semester including assignments × 2, project × 3 phases, IPRS × 20 units out of ~ 25 units, Midterm and a Final exam. There are also a tutorial session each week other than two lectures. <br /><br />I personally think the workload is ok for those who take ≤ 15 credits in one semester. But if you are taking ≤&nbsp;&nbsp;18 credits in the upcoming semester. You better choose another course. Since CORE1232 has a lot of stuffs to get used to (contents cover in the lectures, manipulation of excel, etc). You also need to do lots of exercises and complete an array of past papers to excel in the exam in order to attain a satisfactory grade.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, one of the workload that might become one of the heaviest burden in your semester is the procedure of repeatedly doing past papers and getting yourself familiar to the questions. Despite the fact that the questions are repeated in some ways, you still need to spend some time to adapt to those patterns.",
