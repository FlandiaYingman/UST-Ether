We examine the&nbsp;&nbsp;role, objectives and function of financial&nbsp;&nbsp;regulation,&nbsp;&nbsp;the evolving role of central banking and monetary policy and the implications and consequences on financial institutions and markets. Throughout the course we link prevalent economic theories to market realities. Topics covered include: the fundamentals&nbsp;&nbsp;of interest rates and&nbsp;&nbsp;basic pricing&nbsp;&nbsp;of financial assets,&nbsp;&nbsp;including basic concepts such as&nbsp;&nbsp;cash flows, the time value of money and&nbsp;&nbsp;the risk-return&nbsp;&nbsp;tradeoff; the&nbsp;&nbsp;structure&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;function of the financial system, the&nbsp;&nbsp;role and the types of&nbsp;&nbsp;financial institutions and financial intermediaries; the goals of financial and banking regulations, the organization of central banks and the role of monetary policy. There will be a strong focus on financial institutions, understanding the role that the different types of firms play and how they interact. This course does NOT go into details of various markets for stocks, bonds and other securities, which are covered in other finance courses.",

I would say this course covers topic which would be discussed in FINA2303 + FINA3204 + FINA3404 + something related to Hong Kong financial system.

The professor has a limit that the recording has to be within 3 minutes so the project workload is not huge. Perhaps the study of content could constitute to a larger workload as there are lots of things to study, each PPT can be like 50-150 slides so you might need to study a lot about the finance concepts.",

I suppose it varies year to year but sometimes she shared important financial or business news with us and discussed current events. Not graded ofcs. <br /><br />Some stuff is more interesting than others but that's a personal preference. The only potential negative for content is that there's quite a lot to cover.",

She will explain the answer. <br /><br />Chat/Breakout Room - We only had two breakout rooms. She tells u to go discuss something then come back and one person per group share with the class. If your group did nothing pray u can bs or just rephrase what the other groups said. Unless your group 1 in which case good luck. For chat don't ask stupid stupid things or the questions where you're actually showing off your financial knowledge. Prof and TA will sense it from a mile away. Just IPRS is fine for participation points. IPRS questions actually show up again in the quizzes.<br /><br />Quizzes &amp; Exam - Time limit (hour to hour and a half if i remember correctly) TF, MCQ and fill ins. There are a lot more T/F and MCQ then fill ins but the fill ins are worth a lot of points and are math questions. She provides a spreadsheet for the formula so the trick is figuring out from the word question which formula to use. Open Book quiz.<br /><br />A lot of the questions are actually only quizzes online.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Groupwork - Two group projects. One was to record a presentation and send and another was to find news videos corresponding to a prompt. These are early in the class so ask her questions and get her to check before the hand in. You can ask if the article link you chose seems ok. Take the opportunity of her kindness in this matter.Also, a lot less work than it sounds like.",

Based on my friends' opinion, the final exam is 90% the same with the questions in quiz 3 &amp; 4 with no calculation, so they are easily secure an A. <br /><br />Now maybe the prof know it is too easy for business student and she makes it a lot harder.",

Make sure you find a responsible and business student. It is basically finding a financial news and short video online for an assigned topic and they will shown during the class. The 2nd group assignment is to conduct a presentation on a latest financial news. The presentation lasts for 3 mins but basically every group uses around 7-10 mins and the prof won't stop you indeed. Don't be stupid and make a 3 mins presentation. <br /><br />The online quizzes are basically 90% the same as the source. Just make sure you have the sources before reging this course.",

The bad thing is there is a large amount of content. Each powerpoint can have more than 100 slides and there are lots of words. It also mentions a lot of laws and regulations like that famous Glass-Steagall Act. If you have relative background knowledge, it will be fun. If not, you may have a hard time remembering the names and the rules.",

(3-min presentation so easy as well.) Two exams are all MCQs (many of them are from powerpoint slides and quizzes so remember to revise those questions before the exams.)",

            "comment_content": "JUST A LOT OF HARD FACTS TO RECITE!<br /><br />This course gives you an overview on financial market such as overview on commercial &amp; investment banks, interests rate calculations and financial regulations. This course can give you a brief overview on what finance is about, but I feel like there are too much stuff to recite (Expect &gt;70 slides per chapter) and it gets kinda boring. It doesn't matter whether you've studies BAFS in DSE as almost all chapters are new stuff.<br /><br />===Content=== (* involves calculation)<br />1. Introduction to Financial Markets<br />*2. Foundations of Interest Rates I<br />*3. Foundations of Interest Rates II<br />4. Financial Intermediation<br />5. The Sell Side: Commercial Banks<br />6. The Sell Side: Investment Banks<br />----Mid Term (Ch. 1~6 [1st part])----<br />7. The Buy Side: Traditional Investors<br />*8. Stock Valuation<br />9. The Shadow Market: Alternative Investors<br />10. Financial Regulations<br />----Final Exam (Ch. 6 [2nd part] ~10)----<br /><br />===General Comments===<br />Basically this course introduces what financial services do, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds and etc. The professor didn't go too deep into those and introduces us some common technical jargon.<br /><br />However, I don't like that this course needs so much memorization! Each chapter has around 20~40 slides that have key points to remember, and sometimes we need to recite BORING stuff like which regulation does what thing. Would love to see more calculation in this course rather than factual stuff.<br /><br />I would recommend this course to business students because the calculation concepts will be taught again in FINA2303 so it's good to have some background knowledge",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor tries to make the lesson atmosphere relaxed and fun. She loves asking students questions and run around in the lecture hall to stuff microphone to students.<br /><br />I think she's fine when explaining concepts. She would give basic explanation to technical terms and make additional notes. What I don't like about her is that she only explains HALF of the technical jargon! It's very easy to get lost in lessons as she skip lecture slides so fast that I cannot digest. You need to look out the remaining jargon in Investopedia mainly<br /><br />She also loves to go off-topic in lessons to introduce you current issues in finance or a scenario problem. This gives you some more insight, but personally I would love her explain the jargon clearer instead. It's kinda boring when she does that.",

Very hard to get A range if your mid-term isn't above 1 SD<br /><br />===PRS===<br />She forces you to attend the lessons by asking 4~5 PRS questions per lecture. Sometimes the PRS answers are written lecture notes (Especially calculation) and still some will get wrong<br /><br />===Online Quiz===<br />Professor will give total of 4 quizzes in Canvas (30 minutes each). Some questions are in PRS and some questions ask you topics that have NEVER appeared in notes! They just copy last semester's question so it would be great if you have source :P<br /><br />===Mid-Term &amp; Final===<br />RECITE THE CANVAS QUIZ QUESTIONS! 40% of the questions are straight up copied from the quizzes! Both papers are all MC questions. Sometimes they ask you very detailed.",

Just take some time reciting the boring facts and constantly going to Investopedia<br /><br />===Group Projects===<br />You need to join a group and do two tasks. First one is to find a news article and a video related to current financial issues. Second one is a super short financial news presentation.
