I highly recommend students with engineering/science background to register this course as most of the content are so useful in daily life. As I didn't study economics before, some chapters such as federal reserve and interest rate are just mind-blown for me.<br /><br />Most topics are focused on macro-economic with few introductory chapters relate to micro-economic. One and a half lecture is to watch a movie &quot;Inside jobs&quot; regarding the financial crisis in 2008, which would be the examination content.",

However, I still did most assignment questions every week as it is good for mid-term revision. <br /><br />Mid terms are not difficult even thought I didn't take econ in HKDSE.

The specific topics covered are covered in other reviews so check there, but in general they are within the DSE economics and AP macroeconomics syllabus. <br />For this reason there is abundant coverage of these topics online, so I would say you won't have a hard time grasping these concepts.<br />The addition of the film Inside Job gives you a glimpse into the 2008 financial crisis and the dark side of the financial sector, which is pretty fascinating IMO.<br />The goal of this course is to help you understand the economic news you see everyday, so I would say the content of this course is adequate.",

Although I believe most students get full marks, no personal or global statistics are distributed for second assignments. <br /><br />10% attendance - Again unclear. No concrete method of calculating attendance is provided. <br /><br />40% midterm and 40% final - Both exams contain conceptual questions where most of them are simple. Again, for the final, individual grade and global grade distributions are unknown. <br /><br />Given so many unknown components, fortunately my final grade is one of the few things that I can know.

It is very useful for someone who has not studied economics before. <br />Textbook: Principles of Macroeconomics 7e by Frank, Bernanke, Antonovics and Heffetz.<br />The textbook is strongly recommended as it explains the concepts really well and contains a lot of examples based on the true events. It helps you get good grade.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Holz is really a good professor and an excellent scholar. He is very thoughtful. He would not make you do something that you do not like. If you don't like midterms you can choose not to take it, if you do not want to attend classes you can just go. He would also play some course-related youtube videos, which are VERY helpful to your understanding of economics, and he would also explain some economy-related events using the up-to-date newspaper. You can tell that he has put his heart in teaching the course.",
            "comment_grading": "16% homework, 22% mid term 1, 22% mid term 2, 40% final exam. If you do not take the mid term exams then the final exam would take up 86%. <br />If you submit homework on time, you get full marks, no matter how terribly you perform in your homework.<br />the questions in the exams are not difficult, as long as you hit the books<br />Quiz 1: Mean: 47 SD: 7<br />Quiz 2: Mean: 44.1 SD:8<br />I got 57 in quiz 1 and 54 in quiz 2<br />This semester, according to the recent events, the schemes change a bit, you can choose to take the final exam or all in midterm exams or get a P/F. If all in mid term exam, the mid terms would make up 84% of your final score and I personally chose this grading scheme.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------The results just came out and I got a B! I just want to say WTF since the grading is really terrible and unacceptable. I got 96% and I got a B!!!!!!! I really did not know what had happened.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />Turns out that three people lost 16% because of a mistake, after correcting the mistake, my final grade is an A, 96%. And you can see that less than 80% can still get a B, so pretty good grade!",
            "comment_workload": "If you have not studied economics before, it would probably be large because you may spend 3 hours a week going through the textbook. If you have studied economics before, it would probably be zero.<br />Overall the workload is not big and it is completely worth it if you have not studied economics before. It is a very useful CCC.",

Essentially, this course covers the basics of macro- and microeconomics. By taking this course, you will learn about the principles that govern the behavior of the market and economy as a whole. Furthermore, you will also discuss current and recent economic events.",

His lectures follow the textbook extremely faithfully, so you won't miss out on any crucial information if you choose to not attend the lectures. However, Professor Holz frequently incorporates amusing examples or demos that help to grasp the concepts and make the lectures more entertaining.",

If you choose to not take it, then final exam will be worth 84% of the total grade. Assignments are graded based on completion. Both exams are quite simple, as long as go over all the presentations or read the textbook.<br />Overall, I'd say grading is fair.",
            "comment_workload": "There isn't a lot of workload. There are around 10 assignments, but you only need to complete 8 to get the perfect grade for assignments. Professor Holz is very lenient with assignment grading. You won't lose points for leaving a few questions unanswered or wrong. However, late work is accepted under no conditions. There is no attendance, so all lectures are optional, although I recommend to at least go watch the movie at the end of the semester since it comes out on the final exam. Even the midterm exam is not mandatory.",

It's okay if you miss one&nbsp;&nbsp;cause you will have approx. 12 assignments. <br />2. Midterm : 34% (MC questions mostly about memorization and 5 short questions if I'm not mistaken). The paper had like almost 100 numbers and had to be finished within 1 hour. You can miss the midterm and opt to add the grading in the final which I would highly discourage because the midterm is way easier than the final. <br />3. Final : 50% (MC and short questions) Cumulative and rather more difficult than midterm since it covers more chapters. Contains basic calculation and very few difficult questions that you can shoot. After the midterm, he will play a movie about US Financial Crisis in 2007 &quot;The Inside Jobs&quot;. Everyone on the previous UST space's review said that the movie will cover almost half of the exam, which is not true. Only 1 question in the essay appeared about this movie.

You only have 80 minutes to complete the test, so don't waste time on questions for which you lack a concrete solution. [You can choose not to take the midterm: in that case, the final examination will account for 84% of the course grade instead. This is not recommended, however, as the final examination is harder than the midterm.]<br /><br />FINAL EXAMINATION 50% [84%]<br />Comprised of 95 multiple-choice questions and 1 essay question. Covers the entire course, including material examined in the midterm, as well as content regarding the film &quot;Inside Job&quot;. Although the time limit is more lenient (160 minutes), the questions are more difficult on average. Some particularly challenging ones are marked with an asterisk (*), do leave them until the very end.<br /><br />MY GRADE<br />Assignments | 16/16<br />Midterm | 67/72 (Mean = 53.8, S.D. unknown)<br />Final Examination | 93/103 (Mean = 66.8, S.D. = 15.1)<br />Overall | 92.78%<br />Grade | A<br /><br />Note: I have never taken an economics course before.",
            "comment_workload": "On average, one assignment (comprising of questions from the textbook) is released per week, which takes anywhere from 15 mins to 60 mins to complete, due after around one week. As mentioned in the Grading section, you do not have to complete all assignments, though doing so will certainly assist in revising for the midterm and final examination.<br /><br />It is &quot;mandatory&quot; (according to the professor) to buy the textbook and read it, for a better understanding of the concepts taught in the lecture. Assignment questions are scanned and uploaded to Canvas, so technically you do not require the textbook to secure a good grade.",

So very compact int terms of the actual learning process.<br />Terrible writing, so make sure you do your own notes on what he wrote on the screen. <br />Didn't like his pace of teaching at all, he was too slow at the beginning, spent 1 whole lesson on the same concept when going through HW. Then he would be too fast later on during the harder concepts. Terribly rushed in a number of PPTs. Sometimes he would just tell us to read the book as he s scrolled through the PPT. <br />***Highly recommended to go to lecture when he talks about HW solutions, he welcomes questions then.",

However you need to pay attention to calculations since the final asked a lot about that. at almost the end of the lecture a movie about the financial crisis of USA will be played.

However since he didn't really speak up and his voice is boring, not many students listen to his lectures.

More specifically, this course is an introduction to macroeconomics. <br />The course also covers a documentary, 'Inside Job', which is about the 2008 Financial Crisis. <br />Overall, if you have studied economics in high school, you will have a huge advantage, but it is still possible to do well if you have no prior knowledge in economics--quite a lot of the content can be deduced from common sense, and others require memorization.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professors mainly follows the powerpoint only, so nothing remarkable really happens. Thanks in part to the 'active' participation of the students in class, the lectures tends to be rather boring. In other words, since attendance is not compulsory, it is definitely viable to self-study the contents of this course. (Given that I missed half of the lectures myself, I can verify this). <br />If I am to attend only 1 lecture for this course, it would probably be the final on 'Inside Job', where he gives a bit more detailed explanation on some of the topics such as leverage, which turns out was covered rather extensively in the final exam. Other than that, since you can watch the documentary on your own, you really do not have to attend the lessons.",
            "comment_grading": "The score calculation is as follow:<br />Assignment: 16% (You do not need to do all 12 assignments, around 8-9 is ok)<br />Mid-Term: 34% (You can choose to not attend Mid-Term, then it will not count towards your overall score)<br />Final: 50% (84% if you choose not to attend the Mid-Term. It is definitely viable--I know people who does this and get good score. It just depends if you want to gamble your entire grade on 1 exam)<br />The mean, according to the course introduction document, is B-. However, as stated on the document, it is only true 'when in doubt', and the actual mean can be higher or lower. Given the scores shown in Canvas. I would guess the mean is B, but I cannot give a definite answer on that.",
            "comment_workload": "The weekly assignments usually consist of around 8 questions from the textbook &quot;Principles on Macroeconomics&quot;. The work load is quite heavy...if you take the assignments seriously. However, the TAs probably do not even bother to read your answer, so as long as you hand in something, you will get 2/2 for your assignment. Apparently, some students even directly copy-paste the previous assignment onto the new assignment, and still get 2/2, so yes, you can see how 'seriously' the TAs are.",
