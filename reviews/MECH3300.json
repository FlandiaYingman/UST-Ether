Apart from exergy that can be a bit tricky, the rest of the content is not complicated and the exercises are ok.",
            "comment_teaching": "Meh. Not that bad of a prof but I personally didn't find any value added in the teaching. He is very nice and ready to answer questions but he didn't seem very comfortable teaching and didn't really explain things as much as he would go through example questions (which are much easier to go through by yourself in the textbook). He was also very slow paced in reviewing content of thermodynamics 1 and rushed through the last few chapters. I found it more efficient to self study and go to lecture to clarify some points instead of attending the slow and non- engaging lectures.",

I wish you never happen on that TA :)<br />- Midterm (35%) and final exams (50%)<br />NO FORMULA SHEET ALLOWED OR PROVIDED FOR THE EXAMS. So you better memorize the formulas, and there are quite a lot of them ( and honestly they are similar...)",
