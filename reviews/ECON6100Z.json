        "description": "This course tries to bridge the gap between economic theory and measurement by an introduction to structural estimation in economics. “Structural” means STRUCTURE derived from economic theory, and “estimation” corresponds to various estimation methods already covered in today’s econometric class. The focus of this course is how to derive econometric equations from economic theory and then use suitable procedures for estimation and inference. Students are expected to learn through examples from labor economics and development economics about these issues: what a complete structure is? To what do error terms in econometric equations correspond? How does structural estimation deal with unobserved heterogeneity, one important type of error terms? Then we would go back to the conceptual part and discuss identification, which one can better appreciate after understanding the basic ideas of structural estimation. The concept of identification and different identification approaches, and a combination of structural estimation methods and experimental (reduced-form) methods will be discussed.",
