The amount of debugging that you might need to do depends on the overall complexity and also how well you've designed the logic.<br /><br />A little tip would be to try to keep it as organized as possible instead of wires going everywhere otherwise debugging will be hell for you and your lab partner.",

Please note that the instructors (except Ki) and coordinators have a mainland accent.<br /><br />Also, worth mentioning that Ki often overruns so make sure you have at least 30 mins to spare after the lesson.<br /><br />Overall, I believe most if not all instructors are doing a decent job in this lecture.",

            "comment_content": "The content of this course is straightforward. You learn about components of the robot that will ultimately lead you to the final project. We covered topics like electronic components, energy, KCL &amp; KVL, DC power, transistor, H-bridge, PWM control, sensors, logics, and the Arduino code. The powerpoint given makes the content extremely easy to follow.",
            "comment_teaching": "The lectures are a little boring but since they are only 50 minutes, it is tolerable. Professor Murch's voice is clear but some of the content might be covered too fast it is hard to understand. The professor will always ask if we have any questions and replies to emails quickly. The powerpoint slides are great and if you miss any lectures you would most likely still understand the content. My TA is Yi Meng and she recaps what is taught in the lectures and prepare us for the labs.",
            "comment_grading": "Lab: 6 Lab Assignments (30% total).<br />Quiz: Pop-up In-class Quizzes (open book, 10% total), online submission in iPRS (20 questions in total, only the top 60% answers will be counted).<br />Exam: On-line Exam (close book, 35%).<br />Project: Project Demo (20%) and Report (5%).<br /><br />The lab was extremely easy to complete as answers are provided in the powerpoint in the tutorials. Most students get a full score here. For the pop quizzes, if you pay attention to the lectures, you should do fine. As for the exam, I thought I prepared well but I still find it challenging. The exam was divided into MCQ, FRQ, and Tinkercad circuit test. For the last part, it is either you get the points or not and it is worth 20 percent of the test. I forgot to put a wire to connect the GND to GND which costed me 20 marks. The project is also a complete nightmare. You are supposed to write a code for a robot to make it complete the tasks and earn points. However, much of the part is based on luck since various factors can affect how much your robot performs and there's only a few chances you can debug your code and test it out. It really depends on luck if your robot works. I used the same code many times and got different results. You also need to write a report at the end. <br /><br />My scores: <br />Lab: Full <br />Quiz: Full <br />Exam: 47.67/100 (mean: 71.40, SD: 20.09)<br />Lab: 18/20 <br />Report 5/5 <br /><br />Turns out I got a B-. I think the grading is pretty good considering my extremely poor exam score. Overall, the content of the course is interesting. However, if you aim for a great score and don't want to suffer with the project, don't choose it.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is average for a 4 credit course. There is a lab that you have to complete every week. I think it should take around 2 hours. The professor might also release some homework for practice but it is not required that you submit it. The worst part would be stressing about the project since there's only a few chances to test the code and you really have to make sure that there are no mistakes. The project report has a minimum of 1200 words. You can finish it in one day.",

It is generally separated into the theory and practical section, with theory lessons supporting the practical project.<br />The theory part contains the following topics: Electronic equipments, DC and AC power, PWM (Pulse width modulation) control, H-Bridge and Transistors, Kirchoff's Laws, Sequential logic and Arduino Programming. There will be a written exam at the end of term assessing understanding of above topics so revising is recommended.<br />The contents learned from above topics also have to be applied to program an electronic robot car to run on a designated track without error, built from scratch, for the practical project. The demo of robot car on the track will take a large portion of the final grade.<br />While contents are very basic, students with programming and/or Physics background will find it much easier to understand.",

He's also very enthusiastic, welcoming to questions and constantly invite students to approach him.

However, the tutorial session before project demo is very useful and worth attending as it provide tips to score well and dealing with problems in the project demo.",

There are two 50 minute lectures, one 50 minute tutorial and one 3 hour lab session per week.<br />The lectures are not necessary to attend (no attendance) but I find it helpful to have someone explain the content on the powerpoint. <br />The tutorial is also not necessary to attend, it mostly gives you more information on the upcoming labs. <br />If your group finishes the labs fast you can leave early. <br />For the final project, it mainly depends on how efficient your group works to finish the task. I have heard of some groups staying overnight in the lab to finish their car but I think that is unnecessary.",

Then it moves on to more complicated electronic components like H-Bridges, Transistors, etc. <br /><br />The main objective of the course is to make a functional car using electronic junk to move in a given circuit.<br /><br />They don't take attendance in lectures, but they do in labs. The course is highly focused on practical work, so you can skip lectures and read online notes. Lab attendance is more important.<br /><br /> BUT, they have quizzes in lectures that aren't announced. (3 quizzes in total, from my experience) It's good to be well informed about them by people in your own lecture or in other lectures. If you skipped a lecture that had a quiz, you could go to the next lecture available in the week to take it.",

(I don't know the exact percentages, refer to other reviews, soz :p)<br /><br />This course has labs, a midterm and a project, BUT NO EXAM. (yay?)<br /><br />Labs take up a moderate chunk of the percentage, but if you go to them regularly and know what youre doing, it's gonna be easy. You can always ask STAs / TAs for help during lab. If you finish early, you get bonus marks to your lab. Make sure you print out the labs before going to the room. (there are printers on the way to the lab, so you can print right before then) [I attended every lab, and got good marks in every one. I got the time bonus in the beginning of the course, but didnt in the ones later cuz the content got harder]<br /><br />Midterms also take up a large amount of the percentage, there is lab and written mids.<br /><br /> DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTY OF WRITTEN MIDTERMS. Many people's grades got screwed over cuz of midterms. If you want to survive midterms, there is a pastpaper example in canvas' files. The sample is very similar to the midterms, so try to go through that and absorb it with every fiber of your soul. The other tutorial notes are kinda good too. [I got pretty good marks in midterms thanks to the sample paper]<br /><br />LAB MIDTERMS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD. It's very similar to the labs you'll do, just remember how all the components and equipment in the lab work and you should be ok. Bring a calculator (cuz i forgot mine) and pen/ pencil.<br /><br />The Project is a nightmare if you dont know what youre doing, and it takes up a lot of your grading. (More elaborated in WORKLOAD)<br /><br />Got an A- overall",
            "comment_workload": "The workload isnt that much in the beginning, just labs (and maybe some pop quizzes) and done, but it will become a hella lot harder later on cuz the content becomes a bit harder and mainly cuz of the PROJECT.<br /><br />Tips for the project<br />- Get a good teammate to work with for labs, cuz lab partners are gonna be your project teammate (preferably a friend). If they're lazy/ dont know what theyre doing, you're gonna die (unless you can carry the team like a mule, TEAMWORK IS NEEDED). Collaborating with your partner doesnt always mean you both need to meet up at the same time slot. You both can work on it in the lab whenever you can. just make sure you know your roles.<br /><br />- Try team up and communicate with other groups (The grading is absolute, so no bell curves like the dses. Multi group collaboration is beneficial for everyone.)<br /><br />- Be organized (If your entire breadboard is messed up with random components, debugging will be hard. Once your labs are done, you can clear it up for the project)<br /><br />- Check your components if they work and on how they work ( If the circuit is not working, you're not always wrong, some sections of the bread board dont work + some of the sensors are faulty)<br /><br />- Keep on testing your electro-car and try finish early. (If you go for the earlier final demo, youll have 4 attempts to run the car in case any errors occur. going for the later one only gives you 2 attempts, which is bad. Have timeslots to work on your car whenever the lab is open)<br /><br />- Understand the way the components work. (You can always google image the components and see what pins do what. Not doing so might cause your components to short circuit and could even break your breadboard)<br /><br />- There are going to be some allnighters, guaranteed. So prep some caffeine up for it.<br /><br />- AFTER THE PROJECT, YOU WILL BE INTERVIEWED ON HOW YOUR CAR WORKS. Make sure you know how the components work to make the car run as it does.<br /><br />-glhf<br /><br />Got full marks for the project.",

On top of all of these, this course is more practical-based, as Prof. Song put it: &quot;Here, labs are more important than lectures; don't skip labs even if you skip lectures.&quot;<br /><br />The Project Period in the latter part of the course gives you the freedom to design your very own logic to instruct a robotic car to complete a route (e.g. staying on track, choosing the correct branch to go, bouncing off at goal). For me it is the part of the course &quot;you can learn most&quot; because you are doing everything on your own. The lab opens 24h except when having labs for other courses, and the teaching team would help you with everything you need including consulting about your design.

We didn't do that and costed us a rather complex design in the end.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Song explained things super clearly and interestingly.<br />His approach to lecture is to write on the whiteboard (speedily), and he keeps everything simple and write as he speaks. He stresses on the point that being an engineer we are practical, so for example when doing some math he would skip the steps as long as everyone knows what's happening. Sometimes he uses the powerpoint for a slide or two but you can still see things link together. A very good presenter.<br /><br />Before the start of lecture he usually plays some videos about recent robotics advancements, leaving behind inspiring remarks to let us imagine and think.<br /><br />He makes jokes and tries his best to interact with his students too. Most of the students become friends with him. He would poke you to start a casual conversation. After lecture, he welcomes questions and we pretty much flocked to his room. Cantonese/Mandarin/English all okay. He tries to understand your level of understanding towards the concept and then interprets the concept from your perspective.<br /><br />The last lecture was memorable. It was no longer about the course but more about coaching about university life and career, owing to the enrolment situation that most students here are freshmen. I can see that Prof. Song wanted to do more than transferring knowledge, but to make sense out of going to university as a norm, hence educate us to exploit our university life well.<br /><br />TAs are nice also. Yimeng might have some issues with her English accents but she was kind and willing/passionate about teaching. Others assist lab operations as well as project period support well.<br /><br />The teaching team was and probably will be generous enough to offer you support and even tell you not to worry in every possible ways. So just do your best, and have fun building!",

Prof. Song seemed to be planning to set a new rule in which if your group can give a perfect run in the Mini-Contest you can directly get A+ regardless of what. Whether this is true besides, you need substantial time and patience to achieve this (only 1 group did it in my term), so I can somehow predict that A+ is quite a grand quest.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say it is moderate. Labs and project need most effort.<br /><br />Lectures are short (50 mins) and not mandatory, Prof. Song had hand-written notes all scanned online, plus powerpoint slides uploaded frequently to Canvas. To be frank you can skip lectures and manage your own time to cram materials, though not much needed to cram anyways. Tutorials are similar, but they are more directly useful in terms of helping you to complete the lab work efficiently. Midterms are not particularly difficult in terms of content, you need to be calm and revise to the point of understanding is enough, no need to do much exercise, but be sure you are familiar with the lab machines as you rely on them in the lab midterm.<br /><br />Labs and Project<br />- How much you can score in labs and project depend largely on your use of time. There were quite some instances where students get frustrated when they cannot finish the labs on time for the bonus or even before the lab session ends, for me it was the lab midterm; and getting desperate when they find out not much time is left for the Demo to come. It is unwise to lose scores because of this, so all I can say is be careful<br />- Your time invested is proportional to your performance. (Some say you would sleep in the lab in the project period...)<br />- Raise questions when you encounter problems, so the best way is to be attentive enough to be able to raise questions.",

            "comment_content": "The whole course is based on making a robotic car that can traverse a track. <br /><br />You will learn about different circuit components(at a very very basic level) <br /><br />Topics that will prepare you for the final project would be <br />- Circuit components(Resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors) <br />- Kirchoffs Voltage and Current Laws, which are pretty much just conservation of energy laws for circuits<br />- car components(motors &amp; pulse width modulation,&nbsp;&nbsp;sensors, Arduino, H-bridge and inverter Integrated circuits at a basic level)<br />- Boolean logic, algebra, De Morgans law (no k map which is disappointing and I highly recommend self studying<br />- combinational logic(which uses the very basic logic gates)<br />- coding in C/C++ <br /><br />Over all, this course is so fun. <br /><br />The labs are a bit hard at first, but once you get used to the equipment and basic design thinking, its relatively easy to complete each lab in under 2 hours.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Shen is a really good teacher. I like his dumb humour when explaining different components and concepts. Honestly I don't see any problem with his teaching! I dropped by one of Qiao Shiming's lectures, and he spoke like a robot, so err yeah I don't recommend Qiao Shiming. Prof Ki is also a good teacher, also good humour too, but I'd still say that I'd recommend Profession Shen as first choice of teacher tho.",
            "comment_grading": "Since the course is quite basic, the means in the examinations are quite high. <br /><br />- In class quizzes: 10% just attend class, they're freebies.(most can get full) <br />- Lab exercises 6 in total: 30%(most can get full)<br />- Lab Exam: 15%, can be trippy! make sure you know ur machinery!(Mean 12/15) <br />- Midterm Exam that is basically a final exam(and in my opinion a bit too difficult): <br />20% (Mean 71.18/100)<br />- final project and written report: 25% Most people can get full. <br /><br />sadly with the means being high, its hard to know where the A range cutoff is. Also don't expect an A+ when you get mid 90s ;-;<br /><br />Edit: dont even expect A in mid 90s... terrible grading",
            "comment_workload": "Very low for 4 credits! NO ASSIGNMENTS WHATSOEVER! The project was tough and took a considerable amount of time. I'm warning you now, the hardware is shite, the logic can be very difficult if you're new to programming. So don't slack, and get it done asap!<br /><br />Also, for labs, they have a stupid 2 hours or under bonus mark that isn't really a bonus mark, but more of a 'if you don't finish in 2 hours you get -1. But the TAs are very forgiving :) so you can probably get 30/30 even if you don't complete everything in time(speaking from experience xd)",

For the IPRS questions, it is conducted in class and only the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top 70% are calculated. It is very simple to full score. Same for the lab reports and final report, you will get&nbsp;&nbsp;full score with little effort. The only two tricky parts for this course are mid-term and final project.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your car cannot complete the run, say it veered off route<br />at the second corner, you will only get around 14/20. In other courses, it may just be the difference of one subgrade. But in this course, it will be the matter of a whole grade, A+ to B+!!! <br /><br />But, there's time for you to adjust your final project on the real examination route before real exam. If you spend enough time there shouldn't be any problem on getting full score. ( And there's four trials, every trial counts. You can gamble on your luck)<br /><br />I finally got an A for this course. 96/100.<br />I lost 3 marks in the mid-term and 1 mark in the lab report all due to some extremely silly mistakes. I will rate the grading as good because of the simple content. On the other hand, simple means severe competition. That‘s why opinions differ for grading in this course",

According to other comment , it seems like u would need a overall of 96% in&nbsp;&nbsp;order to get to A range, which means that the margin of error is basically zero, on top of that, the project was kinda a RNG, the same set of codes can produce drastically different result anytime. Use myself as an example, we have been through tons and tons of hardware issue like the the fuse was burnt out, the screw were not tightened and the wheels not being in sync, which already put us in a giant disadvantage. The fun doesn't stop there, during the final session, the luck wasn't on our side, by an inch of nail, we went from potentially getting 18/20 to just 14/20.<br /><br />Back to the grading, it was insane. I was above mean in the final, with all other stuff except the project getting near full marks, with the 14/20 in the project, it makes to about 88% in the overall course mark. Guess what, it only gets me a B-, not even B+ by nearly 90%, but B-, it was insane!!!!!!!!!",

However, it was intense at the end of the semester , you are required to finish a coding project , which takes up a majority of your time. We were allowed to test our codes every day , building your code is already not a easy job, the major issue tough is that only 3 project mats are provided every testing session, so we basically have to wait for eternity in order to go through one trial, as a result, all our times were taken up to the point that we even have to skip other lectures to deal with the project.",

He will respond to your emails very quick and explain things clearly to you. Also this sem, the final project was unable to hold f2f, but FOX has done everything he could to ensure a fair environment. Though I didn't get a satisfying mark in project, but I think he've done an excellent job.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading Scheme:<br />- 6 Labs, 6 * 5% = 30%<br />- 3 Quizzes, 3 * 5% = 15%<br />- 1 Written exam, 30%<br />- 1 Project, 20%<br />- 1 Project report, 5%<br /><br />For labs, we did it on Tinkercad, which is easy to get used to. Each lab, they'll give you detail descriptions of what you're supposed to do and during Tutoiral lessons, FOX will explain more and even show you the correct circuit for your reference. You need to assemble your circult before lab lessons and during Lab lessons, you need to share screen and show your work to TA, and after demonstration, you need to submit a simple report, the skeleton has already done for you and you only need to put some screenshots inside. This part is easy to get full mark.(sometimes they don't give full mark for report, e.g. 0.95/1, but it doesn't matter)<br /><br />For quizzes, it appears randomly in the last 10 minutes of a lecture, so you need to pay attention if you usually skip the lecture. The problems are easy and the grading is amazing. There'll be 4 quizzes and each quiz has 5 MC problems, but each problem worths 25 points, meaning that if you answer 4 problems correctly then you'll get full mark. And best 3 of 4 quizzes will be counted. Very easy to get full.<br /><br />For written exam, the problem is a bit harder this year, but only if you understand lecture slides well, there won't be much trouble. This sem the exam was arranged on Canvas, the order of questions is random and as long as you switch to next problem, you are unable to modify previous answers. So some students were worried and didn't get good mark since they met difficult problems at the beginning, which definitely affect moods.<br /><br />For project, you need to write the Arduino code of a car and let it run along the white line on the ground. The Arduino code obeys C/C++ syntax so it'll be much easy if you known C/C++ before. Two code test sessions has been arranged and during each session you can submit two versions of codes and TA will upload your code into the car and run it on the map. Unlike computer program, the car didn't run exactly the same each time, as there'll be many factors that can affect its preformance. So even though your code is completely correct, sometimes you'll also get a low mark. And that happens on myself, which is a pity. Actually no one can ensure the result, but this is the best way that TA can do so do not complain.<br /><br />For the report, you need to describe what you've done in project and describe your code's logic by using flow chart and true tables. As long as you do it as required, you'll get full mark.<br /><br />My score:<br />- Labs: 28.95/30 (I think I've done all of them right, and maybe sometimes they don't give full mark, but I'm not sure)<br />- Quizzes: 15/15<br />- Written exam: 100/100, Mean 66.55/100, SD 16.52/100<br />- Project: 6/20<br />- Report: 5/5<br />Grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is not heavy at all. The labs are easy, as detailed instructions have been given. So it only takes less than 1 hour to finish your circuit and reports.<br />For final project, if you're familier with C/C++, then programming is easy for you. But you need to think a lot for designing the logic and think about special conditions as much as possible and this may takes a long time. 1~2 Weeks required.<br />There's not much new knowledge in lecture slides, so basically you don't need to spend lots of time for preparing the written exam.",

You have to show the results to the TA. Basically, you can get full marks if you follow the tutorial notes carefully. Also, you get 1 mark by submitting the summary sheet for every lab.<br /><br />There are 4 pop-up quizzes in total. The 3 highest score will be regarded as the final result. All the questions are MCs.<br /><br />The final exam is divided into 3 parts, MCs, Long Questions and circuit building. It is not an open book exam, and using the calculator is not allowed.<br /><br />Well, as long as you spend some effort on this course, you are likely to get some marks. WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THE FINAL PROJECT<br />you get 1% as long as you hand in the source code.<br />4% of the score depends on the report (as long as it meets all requirements, you get full marks).<br />20% of the score depends on how far can your car reach. Many students fail to get desirable marks in this part (very few information is given before the Demo session). Therefore, even though you perform badly in the exam and pop-up quizzes, you can get a good grade if you perform this well.<br /><br />For my case:<br />Labs: 29/30% (Remember to submit the summary sheet ...)<br />Quiz: 9/15% (I guess the average is about 11-12)<br />Exam: 18/30% (I got 61/100 and the average is 67)<br />Project: 20/25%<br />And I got B+ as the final grade.<br />As long as your car work, you get a good grade.<br /><br />Better have some programming background before you join this course.",

The teaching team will run a plagiarism test. Once they found a 100% similarity, you will receive Sanction.i have my friend being downgraded from B+ to C+.So I must stress once again that you must not copy your friend's code directly, else you will put you and your friends in peril",

KCL and KVL would require skills to solve 3 unknown linear equation system.<br /><br />Note: Be reminded that this semester is held at online mode due to COVID-19 outbreak, so the opportunities allowed for the final project may be more than this semester.",

In my case, some wires are connected incorrectly and I cannot find it so I unplug the whole thing (Yes I know its dumb but I did it) and rebuild everything from lab01 to lab06 within 2 hours and it worked. Unless you mess up big times or you are confident with your logic and concentration and carefulness, don't rebuild the whole thing no matter what.

Basic electromagnetic(AC, DC, V=IR, P=IV) is introduced at first which is high school stuff. Later on, you need to learn the functions and structures of some electronics components such as the resistor, capacitor, ICs(Regulator, inverter, comparator, counter, H-bridge), diode and transistor. PWM control, logic, K-map and sensors are also taught. More advanced topics like sequential logic and programming language are not included in midterm but you need the concepts to help you finish the final project. <br /><br />Everything is taught step by step and you should be able to catch up without attending the lessons. But there are two/three pop-up quiz.",

I recommend taking the early demo as you can usually finish the car very early and the early demo give you 4 trials instead of 2 trials in the final demo. <br />There is also a mini-contest which could guarantee you an A if you got the first place. However, doing a round-trip is much harder than 1-way trip, you would need much more time tuning for that. Also, I saw some failed in the mini-contest due to various reasons...

            "comment_content": "LECTURES &amp; TUTORIALS<br />- Please refer to &quot;TEACHING&quot;.<br /><br />LABS:<br />Mandatory, six in total. 2 people working in a group. Find a friend to work together, else you will be matched with one.<br />The labs are easy. TAs are helpful as well. You shouldn't have any problem to get full mark here. Spending a little time reading through the lab notes beforehand is rather useful.<br /><br />MIDTERMS:<br />There are lab midterm and written midterm.<br /><br />Lab midterm: <br />You should learn how to use things like DSO and signal generator properly. Also remember not to mix up normal diode and Zener diode.<br /><br />Written midterm: <br />Not quite difficult. You should get good results if you study well. Pay more attention to the parts about PNP and NPN, as well as the connection of ICs. Those questions are slightly harder.<br /><br />PROJECT: (guide attached below)<br />Have to be done near the end of the semester. Your group (same as that of lab) have to construct an autonomous vehicle to move along the white line with curves and splits. You really have to spend some time on it, like testing Arduino codes. Around 4 to 5 days in lab is enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy the art of debugging your vehicle!<br /><br />Demo, interview and report required for the project. Take the early demo if you can finish the car early.<br /><br />Early Demo: testing x2, trial x4<br />Normal Demo: testing x1, trial x2<br /><br />MINI-CONTEST:<br />Optional. Complete a round-trip of the project map as quick as possible. Winning group members will be guaranteed getting an A. My line sensors are not working well in a contest so I didn't get any prize. There will be prizes for top 10 groups, ranging from trophies to society paper. The fastest group finished in 39 seconds (round-trip), whereas 35 seconds is the time limit of getting full mark for project demo (one-way). Pretty hard to win the contest. Don't try to rely on the contest to get A. But if you can do so, you can simply ignore everything else.",
            "comment_teaching": "The choice of instructor does not matter a lot. I don't really pay attention to what he said in class. His accents are a little bit weird but still able get what he is saying. He just simply read those powerpoints with slightly more explanations, which is rather mundane. Reading notes yourself is enough to get a good grade.<br /><br />LECTURES:<br />There will be pop-up quizzes in lectures. Attendance of lectures is encouraged. Content-wise: For the first few weeks, those are only DSE Physics basic stuff, like dealing with circuits and resistors. Pretty easy. Don't really have to listen if you have DSE physics background. For the next few weeks, something new is taught, but pretty easy to understand. I think reading lecture notes by yourself is okay as well.<br /><br />Topics mainly include: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy, power source, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;pulse generation, PWM control, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;transistors, H-bridge, sensors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;logics, K-map, sequential logics, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Arduino &amp; programming language<br /><br />TUTORIALS:<br />They are not important.

The course introduces different electronic components like diode and transistors, and some knowledge about logics used in electronics (Binary, flip-flop etc.). Although they don't require you to know everything in detail, sometimes things are not easy to understand.<br /><br />Components and circuit structures introduced would be used to build an electro-robot (an electronic car). The car needs to go through a given track by itself (using given components and your design of the circuit). They provide you all the materials you need.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. FAN is passionate in his teaching. He is a professor from Mainland China but his English is easy to understand. He is also willing to answer your questions. He would try to know whether the students understand the contents.<br /><br />The female TA (I forget her name...) is worse. She can't explain things clearly. I tried to focus on her teaching but I just couldn't understand. It's hard to explain but she is not as good as Prof. FAN in explaining the ideas.<br /><br />In labs you may seek help from TAs if you have questions. They are quite helpful. When something doesn't work and you have no idea why, they are usually willing to spend time helping you to find out.",

Please try to look for it in other reviews if you wish to know.<br /><br />Things in written mid-term was quite hard to me (maybe I'm just bad T.T) . I got like 30-40%. In the lab mid-term I got slightly above mean.<br /><br />Since I have a good groupmate and we both were willing to work on the project, we got full mark in everything in the final project.<br /><br />Got B grade finally. It's not that harsh actually.",
            "comment_workload": "It is a 4-credit course, so the workload is surely heavier than 3-credit courses, but not that terrible indeed once you have got used to labs.<br /><br />One lab mid-term, one written mid-term, no final exam but a final project. No homework.<br /><br />There are lectures, tutorials and lab sessions every week. A few sudden quizzes in lectures.<br />One lab per week. You need to form a group with one groupmate for all the lab work (can't be changed later). The tutorials introduce things you need to know for the coming lab (some of them actually overlap with things talked about in lectures).<br /><br />Before mid-term, labs are experiments that let you get your hands on the components introduced and learn how to use the equipment.<br />After the mid-term exams, the circuit built in labs is for your final project (the car), and you keep progressing it in every lab.<br /><br />A final written report needs to be submitted after the final project demo.<br /><br />This course is a fun and unforgettable experience for me. Instead of just sitting in lectures, you really have a chance to build a robot from group-up and utilize the components you have learned about. Of course it would be quite painful if your groupmate is a free-rider. Better have a friend to study this course with you (REMEMBER: You two need to be in the same lab session).",

On top of all of these, this course is more practical-based, as Prof. Song put it: &quot;Here, labs are more important than lectures; don't skip labs even if you skip lectures.&quot;<br /><br />The Project Period in the latter part of the course gives you the freedom to design your very own logic to instruct a robotic car to complete a route (e.g. staying on track, choosing the correct branch to go, bouncing off at goal).

Tutorials are similar, but they are more directly useful in terms of helping you to complete the lab work efficiently. Midterms are not particularly difficult in terms of content, you need to be calm and revise to the point of understanding is enough, no need to do much exercise, but be sure you are familiar with the lab machines as you rely on them in the lab midterm.<br /><br />Labs and Project<br />- How much you can score in labs and project depend largely on your use of time. There were quite some instances where students get frustrated when they cannot finish the labs on time for the bonus or even before the lab session ends, for me it was the lab midterm; and getting desperate when they find out not much time is left for the Demo to come. It is unwise to lose scores because of this, so all I can say is be careful<br />- Your time invested is proportional to your performance. (Some say you would sleep in the lab in the project period...)<br />- Raise questions when you encounter problems, so the best way is to be attentive enough to be able to raise questions.",

            "comment_teaching": "For me, Prof.SIN's spoke too slowly that I often fell asleep. Or maybe because I was taking his 9AM class. But the nice thing about him is that he is always willing to answer questions, so just go and ask him!<br /><br />By the way, another important thing is to ask the TA,who will be in charge of all the exams and the final project. Any time you have a question in your mind, just throw it to the TA. My TA was really helpful.",

            "comment_workload": "As mentioned in the Grading section, the workload depends. If you want to get a good grade, you need to shed sweat and put time and effort into it. <br /><br />Also you need to take the Labs seriously. Though you could count on your &quot;almighty, super nerdy, all A+&quot;groupmate, you will have to take the lab midterm on your own. At that time, you will realize whether you have truly learnt the skills or not.",

            "comment_content": "這門課的LectureTimeslot是很靈活的。因為即使你reg進了一個堂你也可以隨時去另一個堂聽課。雖然課上會有突如其來的quiz，等同是attendance，但是你可以早上睡過一個quiz馬上下午到另一個堂上補回來，都是可以的。比如我這學期就是reg進了周一和周三的九點宋勝輝堂（畢竟這兩個堂選的人稍微少點，考慮到競爭會不那麽激烈）然後周三的九點堂常常睡過，於是就去補周五中午12點的施林堂。第一次quiz周三的睡過去了，星期五去補上了，毫無壓力。<br /> <br /> <br />然後課程內容簡單易懂，結合中學的電路知識可以很輕松地理解。<br /> <br /> <br />Lab很重要。畢竟是個ELEC課，重點全在動手。Lab是累積性的，也就是說之前Lab做好的基礎工程在之後會用到，每次Lab基本上都是在上一次的結果上疊加，所以一定要養成好習慣1.剪線盡量剛剛夠長度，導線盡量貼著底部，這樣就算後面的邏輯電路的線飛得到處都是也不至於和之前的基礎工程搞混2.IC盡量放得靠近些，節省空間，否則之後你會發現沒有地方放邏輯。。。<br /> <br /> <br />說說Project。其實我在開工之前請教了很多高人，他們的經驗對我影響不小。一開始我執著地相信他們的做法，從沒有懷疑過，所以走了很多彎路。然而最後發現就我的Project而言得改很多地方才能夠達到效果。果然自己的project還是得自己做，自己不斷嘗試，不斷debug，不斷總結才行。所以keepin mind兩點 1.不要只顧著求新求異，任何新異的設計都應該有實用性的理由支持，而不是全憑借想象設計2.得做好花時間的心理準備，不要妄圖一夜之間就做好，很多時候都是一個設計不行又改一個設計，很多出現的意外和不穩定性都得絞盡腦汁思考解決方案。刷夜不是必須的（我就沒刷過），但是你得把整個做project的period放長，因為很多時候一個新問題暴露出來你往往不能在在lab的幾個小時之內參透並且解決，反而是回hall睡一覺起來甚至洗澡的時候突然想通。。。所以每次去Lab不一定要刷夜打持久戰，我覺得先想好一個idea之後，去到lab集中幾個小時實現這個idea之後test幾圈debug一下就可以回去了，隔天再來就好。個人認為效率高於刷夜。OwO",

Later on in the course, they teach us Arduino.<br /><br />The final project involves building a robot car that follows a white line 'UST' on a black mat with an Arduino Nano board as the control unit. It needs good manipulative skills to build the robot car because some parts of your car may be broken down when you are testing.

Introduces new circuit stuff like transistors, diodes, capacitors, logic gates, timers, etc but not much calculation for those is required (you can always follow the given equations)<br /><br />Also introduces some circuitry calculation/planning concepts like KVL/KCL and K-map. Nothing too hard tho.<br /><br />The whole goal of the course is to give your the minimum knowledge to make a robot-controlling circuit board (+ program), so not much is really taught in depth.",
            "comment_teaching": "Meh.<br /><br />Professors and TAs tend to be pretty helpful (at least this time around) because of the difficulty in building circuitry without a physical circuit.<br /><br />There's nothing particularly bad about the teaching method, it's just hindered by the fact that this course had to be online and labs are just &quot;connect the dots in this simulation website&quot; plus a bit of paperwork.",
            "comment_grading": "It's not hard to get to B+ if you basically grasped everything in the course. The real challenge comes from the fact that the robot trials are done &quot;online&quot; (remotely by sending your program to the TAs and let them run by themselves).<br /><br />Welcome to the biggest Online Casino of HKUST.<br /><br />You are only given 5 trials, 3 different submission attempts and no other possible way of testing whether your robot works in real life. You can make it work in theory, which gives you 14/20 points (20% of final grade), but the rest depends on whether your robot is lucky enough to not bug out when running through the track. Otherwise comes the nondeterministic filter that separates lucky A-rangers from the unlucky B-or-less grades. (Unless you do exceptionally well in the &quot;written&quot; exam)<br /><br />If you really aim for A range, this course is not for you.",
            "comment_workload": "It's less &quot;heavy workload&quot; but &quot;unfair correlation between workload and actual grade&quot;. The workload is pretty light. 6 labs (basically connecting the dots, as said above), 1 homework (which is decent as a practice) and the final project (and PRS).<br /><br />Since there is no way to test your project in real life (other than buying the circuits yourself or spending the trials), the project (which takes a good portion of the grading) doesn't really reward based on effort, but on luck.<br /><br />I'd rather have a heavier workload than have a result that I couldn't have controlled.",

Everyone spent so much time on the project yet it weights less than the labs just makes no sense. There are so many to write in the project report but it only contributes 5% to the total grade, and it seems that as soon as you have included everything requires in the project report then you get full points. As a result, everyone got full points in every items and your grade only depends on the exam.<br /><br />Good grade or not really depends on what you expect.
