Presenting Results of Stability Evaluations &amp; Factors of Safety and Reliability<br /><br />10. Important details of stability analysis &amp; Strength reduction method in slope stability analysis<br /><br />11. Details of using SLOPE/W<br /><br />-----<br />Frankly speaking, this course is &quot;useless&quot; for some reasons. <br /><br />First, some of the the contents (e.g. chapter 2) are explained in detail in 4750, plus you can have hand-on experience of geo-studio &amp; PLAXIS2D in 4750, whereas 4710 only taught you how to use geo-studio<br /><br />Second, most of the course material can be found online (&quot;Soil Strength and Slope Stability&quot; by J. Michael Duncan and SLOPE/W tutorials), which are far more well-presented and organized<br /><br />If I got another chance, I would take CIVL5720 instead, which seems to be more useful and practical in the industry",

            "comment_workload": "One assignment every two weeks on average, four assignments in total. <br /><br />Although it was stated that there would be in-class quizzes, professor didn't make any quiz anyway<br /><br />Midterm: open-book, only the first three chapters were included in the exam, 2 out of 3 questions are related to the assignments, so make sure you really understand how to do the assignments<br /><br />There was a group project at the end of the semester, so find some diligent &amp; helpful groupmates and manage your time between this project and your FYP",

Zhao includes one addition tutortial to talk about plaxis 2D for slope stability analysis and one lecture to briefly talk about geoguide 7.<br /><br />Did not covers all slope improvement method in slope/w e.g. subsoil drains, surface drainage design.<br /><br />Basically, all slope/w tutorials delivered are available online. So, you dont really have to take this course if you are self driven.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />3/8 update<br />For soil nail part<br />-&gt; Structural design for the nailing facing is not covered<br />-&gt; Nail head design is not covered<br />-&gt; Two zone model is not covered<br />-&gt; Possible mode of failure are not covered<br />-&gt; these content would be enormously useful for students who wish to become geotech engineer<br />-&gt; go read through goeguide 7",
