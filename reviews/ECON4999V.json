        "description": "This course uses a case study approach to discuss machine learning for economic and financial analysis. It maps a series of business problems into the relevant supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. It introduces basic machine learning methods and some simple deep learning models. The case study topics include macroeconomic forecasting, property valuation, financial market prediction and anomaly detection, banking applications such as credit default risk prediction and credit card fraud detection, and others. Students will get hands-on experience with machine learning to analyze practical economic and financial problems.",
