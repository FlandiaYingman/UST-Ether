Fear not, this class will teach you everything you want to know on how to have a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />The seminar on how to enjoy a healthy lifestyle was very intriguing and informative. I learned many things. After the seminar, I have made drastic changes to my lifestyle. <br /><br />I am now gluten free. <br />I am also a vegan. <br /><br />There was also a seminar on why exercise is important, which came with a few demonstrations of how to perform various exercises. This was the moment that changed my life.<br /><br />The feeling of exercise is better than life itself. <br /><br />The pain.<br /><br />Oh, the pain, from working muscles you've never discovered. It was like sex. But much, much better.<br /><br />We were practicing stretches when the instructor told me to get on my hands and knees. I was excited for my very first time. I was going to receive. Receive, that is, knowledge of how to exercise.<br /><br />&quot;Today,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be teaching you how to do push-ups.&quot; He continued to demonstrate the &quot;push-up&quot; a couple times.<br /><br />Eventually, it came our turn to try out these &quot;push-ups.&quot; I lowered my body slowly down onto the ground. I was tense and trying to keep my balance. My palms were sweaty. Knees weak, arms were heavy. There was vomit on my sweater already, mom's spaghetti.<br /><br />I couldn't hold it any longer. I pushed myself up, and then I felt it. It was like my whole body had an orgasm, an orgasm I couldn't contain. It was pure ecstasy. It's the same confused, yet satisfying feeling when a little boy gets his first erection. It was love. It was life. It was Shrek.<br /><br />Needless to say, I had to change my undies before moving onto the next exercise.",

Some may need assistance in mental health and HLTH1010 may provide good alternatives for them to ask for help or relieve stress. But me?

There's a health &amp; fitness assessment but it became another online survey due to covid.<br /><br />Fitness Training (2 hours)<br />A lecture showing you how to use gym equipment. I attended that when school was still face to face, but if it is conducted online it would probably just turn into an online talk.<br /><br />Sports skill class (9 - 12 hours)<br />For your information, I took archery and golf. Due to covid, the classes were conducted online. You are required to show your face, but they won't check closely. Just turn on virtual background, cover your camera, and do anything you want.<br /><br />The face to face sports classes are much less chill as you have to actually show up and practice the sport.<br /><br />Enrolling the classes are tricky. In fall, you have to choose up to 10 classes, and they will allocate based on luck. If you're not given what you wanted, just wait until winter and spring, when enrollment is first come first served.<br /><br />Activities (23 - 26 hours)<br />There are 5 categories in this module (Additional Sports Skill Class, Organized Sports, Self Practice, Wellness &amp; Personal Enrichment (wellness talks), Community or Voluntary Work).<br /><br />I completed the requirement for this with sports skill class and wellness talks only because I'm lazy. The wellness talks do not require camera so you're free to go AFK. I talked about the sports skill class in the previous section.<br /><br />Self practice is another great way to gain hours. You can go to the gym and just sit there, and you'll get a course hour. Don't leave too early or too late though, you will get no hours if you stay in the gym for less than an hour, and you can only get one hour each day no matter how long you sit.<br /><br />The actual content of the classes is meh.

            "comment_content": "This course is a one year course for freshmen (except you fail HLTH1010 before). You need to accumulate 45 course hours so that you can pass this course. Basically, it can be divided into 5 modules and you need to pass all of them. Otherwise, the number of course hours will be recounted in the coming academic year. Here are the modules:<br /><br />1) Orientation Module : Due to COVID-19, this became a 3 hour Zoom lesson. You will know the brief introduction of HLTH1010 and what sports skill classes you can apply for. You may also ask the instructor some questions if you have anything not understand. <br /><br />2) Wellness Module: Generally speaking, it is just some surveys and one fitness assessment. If you are doing the surveys fast, you can actually complete them under an hour for each of them. For the fitness assessment, it is just a series of test, like grip strength test, vertical jump test, 3-minute step test, etc.<br /><br />3) Fitness Training Module: It is a 2-hour lecture and the most important thing you can learn is how to properly use the equipment inside the gym rooms. <br /><br />4) Sports Sill Class Module: The most interesting part of the whole course. Usually, each sports skill class involve 8 lessons for one regular semester. Here are part of the sports skill class you can choose: karate, yoga, tennis, soccer, squash, archery, golf etc.<br /><br />5) Activities Module: It includes five sub-parts: Additional Sports Skill Class, Organized Sports, Self Practice, Wellness &amp; Personal Development, Community or Voluntary Work. I will briefly talk about Self Practice and Wellness &amp; Personal Development here.<br />Self Practice is just basically you go to the gym rooms in HKUST for one hour per day. Remember to check in and check out by putting your student ID card near the card reading machine.<br />Wellness &amp; Personal Development is basically talks and workshops. Usually you can enrol some of them every month, and even the orientation period before the commencement of each academic year.<br /><br />Here is the link to the HLTH1010 website if you want to know more.<br /><br />https://hlth1010.hkust.edu.hk/index.html<br /><br />At last, here is a list for you such that you will know how many course hours are required for passing each module (including maximum and minimum course hours required) :<br /><br />1) Orientation Module: Min: 3, Max: 3<br />2) Wellness Module: Min: 5, Max: 5<br />3) Fitness Training Module: Min: 2, Max: 2<br />4) Sports Skill Class Module: Min: 9, Max: 12<br />5) Activities Module: Min: 23, Max: 26<br /><br />Total minimum required course hour: 45",
            "comment_teaching": "Again, there are not much I can say. However, I think my experience would inspire some of you to choose karate class (especially for those who have a strong will to learn karate/try some new sports skills in university) and the major teaching part is from sports skill classes, so I will just mainly focus on that. <br /><br />I have chosen karate class and my instructor is called Thomas Lau. He has taught in HKUST since 1991 (yes, he has taught karate here since the establishment of HKUST and I knew that since he told me and my classmates during the class). I have done some research and I even found out that Master Lau has won many karate related awards before teaching in HKUST. He has obtained black belt (1st dan) since 1980. Although he is about 60 years old, he is still energetic and professional. He really taught us the interesting concepts and skills of karate. (He is also the instructor of HKUST Karate Club. You will possibly meet him if you join HKUST Karate Club.)<br /><br />I really enjoy the karate class as Master Lau is nice to all of us. He told us that the class was for beginners and just took it easy. In fact, that was true since for most of the time, you are doing warm up exercises (like stretching your arms and legs) before getting into the real part. Although the warm up exercise include jogging around the room and you may think it would be exhausting, this is not true as it is only lasts for about 5 minutes. To be true, even a few (slightly) fat classmates enrol this class and they seems not that exhausted after the warm up exercise. And of course, you will know about the importance of doing so many warm up exercise after Master Lau explain to you. He is really a whole-hearted master. :)<br /><br />Furthermore, Master Lau will regularly approach you to correct your posture other than just staying in front of the whole class for the whole lesson. That is why I say he is an excellent master to teach us karate. Indeed, he would usually have a lot of interaction with us and chat with us during the breaks. This further attract me to engage in the karate classes.<br /><br />In overall speaking, it is not necessary to remember all posture or skills of karate (as they are quite simple for me and you will automatically remember them if you pay attention to the class). Master Lau will help you to review what we have learnt last lesson. Furthermore, if you like to learn some karate to protect yourselves when you are in danger, Master Lau would probably be your best choice. :)<br /><br />(Additional Information: Here is the link to the HKUST Karate Club and you can find more details about Master Lau by clicking the button &quot;SENSEI&quot;: <br /><br />https://karat.su.ust.hk/<br /><br />)",
            "comment_grading": "Only Pass or Fail.<br /><br />There are not many things that I can say. Just remember to regularly check your progress at myPortal and please always check emails so that you will never miss anything that is related to HLTH1010. You should be fine if you can do so. Passing all 5 modules should be quite easy if you are careful and smart. :)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update on 8 April, 2022<br /><br />Of course I pass HLTH1010. :)",
            "comment_workload": "It depends. <br /><br />If you are Mr Lazy/Miss Lazy, or you do not like doing exercises, you will think it is a heavy burden for you.<br /><br />However, if you like doing sports, or you do workouts regularly, then you will possibly think that this is just a piece of cake to complete and pass this course.<br /><br />For me, I do not find it challenging as I enjoy using the gym in HKUST and I want to go to there more frequently since they are new to me. In addition, I like playing with the training machines as I like to doing exercises in an air-conditioned environment. The sports skill class (karate) that I have applied is also very interesting since I have learnt many new and useful skills from Master Lau. <br /><br />The only tip I can give is: spread the work throughout the two regular semesters. Accumulating 45 hours is actually quite easy. Especially for the Activities Module, you can easily get 23 to 26 course hours if you join some workshops and talks that will count as HLTH1010 course hours, and exercise once/twice a week at gyms.<br /><br />(And most importantly, doing exercises regularly can make us stay healthy and strong. You do not want to be sick so often, right?)",

Check your emails, follow the instructions, and you got yourself 5 hours in the record.<br />3. Fitness training: A 2-hour class on fitness and using gym equipment at the LG4 gym. Not a big deal.<br />4. Sports skills class: Up to 8 1.5h-long lessons of a type of sports of your choice (if you managed to enroll in one of your 10 choices) in Fall / Winter / Spring semester. See Teaching for sports. You can skip up to 2 lessons, so you get 9-12 hours of course hours.<br />5. Activities: 23-26 hours (If you got only 9 hours in skills class you need 26 hours here; 12 hours in skills class will lower the requirement here to 23 hours) of activities from 5 categories. See Teaching.",

They're generous enough to arrange make-up sessions in November for the Orientation module.<br />Sports skills class: I enrolled into the Jazz class. Learnt dance moves for 2 songs. Adequate teaching pace and environment.<br />Activities: The most complex part in this course. Categories:<br />a. Additional sports skills class (Max 12h): You know it.<br />b. Organised sports (Max 14h): Sports team practice. If you find them your cup of tea, good for you.<br />c. Self sports practice (Max 14h): The &quot;tapping your student ID card&quot; activity. Easiest way to max out the required hours in this module. Whenever you're free, tap the card at any sports venue, and don't forget to wait for at least 45min to tap the card at the same place again.<br />d. Wellness &amp; personal enrichment (WPE, Max 14h): Workshops. Taking part in endorsed workshops by student organisations will do. There's really A LOT OF THEM that are worth your time. Again, check your emails.<br />e. Community or voluntary work (Max 14h): Similar to WPE.<br />P.S. Hopefully you who are reading this won't have to experience a full online semester, but even in this case, when on-campus sports activities become impossible, the course office is still very nice to minimise your odds of failing this miserable course - postponement of course completion deadline, loads of additional online fitness workshops, and more :)",

I learned many things. After the seminar, I have made drastic changes to my lifestyle.<br /><br />I am now gluten free.<br />I am also a vegan.<br /><br />There was also a seminar on why exercise is important, which came with a few demonstrations of how to perform various exercises. This was the moment that changed my life.<br /><br />The feeling of exercise is better than life itself.<br /><br />The pain.<br /><br />Oh, the pain, from working muscles you've never discovered. It was like sex. But much, much better.<br /><br />We were practicing stretches when the instructor told me to get on my hands and knees. I was excited for my very first time. I was going to receive. Receive, that is, knowledge of how to exercise.<br /><br />&quot;Today,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be teaching you how to do push-ups.&quot; He continued to demonstrate the &quot;push-up&quot; a couple times.<br /><br />Eventually, it came our turn to try out these &quot;push-ups.&quot; I lowered my body slowly down onto the ground. I was tense and trying to keep my balance. My palms were sweaty. Knees weak, arms were heavy. There was vomit on my sweater already, mom's spaghetti.<br /><br />I couldn't hold it any longer. I pushed myself up, and then I felt it. It was like my whole body had an orgasm, an orgasm I couldn't contain. It was pure ecstasy. It's the same confused, yet satisfying feeling when a little boy gets his first erection. It was love. It was life. It was Shrek.<br /><br />Needless to say, I had to change my undies before moving onto the next exercise.",

Registration of different activities and classes should be taken after the opening of the system. <br /><br />Complete the surveys punctually should guarantee you to get at least 4 hrs, so check email regularly and complete the link given. <br /><br />Fitness training class and the fitness assessment are not that demanding, providing opportunities to assess you ability and physical fitness. <br /><br />Sports skill class should be a difficult part since you have to grab a good time slot and less demanding sport activity which helps you release stress and tension. <br /><br />Going to gym regularly and join some activities organised by the university and the schools actually help you to gain at least 23hrs, better get used to it.",
            "comment_teaching": "tutors are still fine but some classes are actually boring, especially when you have to tackle with your study.",
            "comment_grading": "No grading , just pass and fail. <br /><br />complete the requirement early will definitely help you set a reasonable timetable for your study and fun.<br /><br />If you don't manage your time well, you will be like someone who always broke his grade with his small jj, injected with sinovac",
            "comment_workload": "I can just say it depends, if you don't really enjoy sports and not willing to go to the gym for some stretching and physical practice, it can be a tough task for securing sufficient HLTH1010 hours. <br /><br />community work should be done during the semester break since you should have a long holiday preparing for the coming semester.",

Each class has 12 contact hours comprising sessions of 1.5 to 2 hours each. The class schedules and registration details will be announced at the beginning of each Term.<br /><br />The physical education professional staff is responsible for class design and planning while qualified instructors (full-time and part-time) will conduct the classes. Participants will get feedback on their progress and development during the class sessions.",
