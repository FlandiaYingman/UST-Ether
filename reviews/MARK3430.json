You will understand different frameworks and strategies that are important to successful global marketing, and they will be explained clearly with various examples and case studies by the professor.<br /><br />Blended learning is adopted in this course:<br />- Online learning: Main contents were taught via video on Canvas which elaborate on the content on lecture notes; there were very short MC quizzes for each chapter too.<br />- F2F lecture (once a week): Case studies are the main topic in F2F lectures. You will need to be prepared since professor will ask questions and your opinion about them during f2f lectures. The classes will be wrapped up in a short conclusion with takeaways.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is quite engaging as he often asked us questions and opinions regarding case studies. And it was quite fun when professor shared his own personal experience or interacted with exchange students who come from/have visited certain countries that are covered in the cases. He is also very responsive as he gave answers and suggestions via emails quickly even during non-lecture days. Also, he always looked excited during teaching so that's quite fun and enjoyable. <br /><br />He has a very obvious european accent. While a previous review and one of my classmate addressed difficulty in understanding what he was saying, it was a small problem to me. Despite his accent, his pronunciation was clear, his use of word was simple and he was loud, so he was quite comprehensible to me.",

Class participation is easy to get as professor has many trivial questions to ask about the cases. So don't feel shy to speak up.<br /><br />Canvas quizzes and midterms (all MCs) are easy, but the final exam (few MCs, short Qs and short essay Qs) was way more difficult since good memory was no longer enough; it's about comprehension, analysis, and even creativity.<br /><br />Overall, grading is fair.",

So typical marketing course workload.<br /><br />While preparing for both main contents and case studies every week sounds hard, it's not. The lectures mainly focuses on case studies which take around 10 minutes to read (I often skip the background part), and the questions professor asked rarely covered the main content. So I only studied lecture notes when I was free or exams were close (riskier for exams tho).",
