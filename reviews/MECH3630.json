Also, they taught too fast for DC machine and Induction machine. The tutorial lecture notes doesn't contain answers for the question. TA also can't talk fluent during tutorial. But the worst part is the arrangements. For lab report they initially said we need to hand-in hand written group report. But just several hours before the deadline, they said we don't need to hand-write the report. But after the deadline, they said we need to use hand-write the report. Also, they gave instruction for lab after the deadline! But the worst part is the project, no one is sure how can we do the project. We need to do analysis for the motor, however some data need to made up by ourselves while others need to be calculated. But we are quite confused about that, which makes most of them don't know how to do the project.",

The partial solution is quite complete, it has every equation on it except the final answer. However, the project has the greatest workload as nobody is sure how to do it. There are only 2 labs. But they released it at the very end of the semester, which gave us huge workload from the project, lab report and other course's assignments. The project's workload is huge. There are quite a lot of things to do in the project. I and my 4 group-mates spend an entire night doing the project and so as other groups. You need to repeat to calculate data over and over. One part can easily cost 4-5 hours and there are several parts in the project. It can easily takes you 24 hours to finish one project. Also the project is due during exam, and it has way greater workload than exam.",

            "comment_teaching": "TBH, I have only been to his lectures for the first month and he already mixed up some of the basic knowledge of electrical systems. For example, he mentioned that if the voltage was too large, it would pose danger to the user. BUT it is supposed to be CURRENT, NOT VOLTAGE! And he kept switching between different teaching materials. There were tons of appendices with his scribblings about induction machines and others contents. I got most of my learning done from reading the textbooks he suggested. In other words, I have learned nothing out of the lectures except the answers for that week's quizzes. What you will expect to get most of from his lectures will be the answers to the quizzes which make up 30% of the grades. From my experience, he only talked about conceptual knowledge about DC machines, induction machines, and motors, etc. while the tutorial done by TA focused more on calculation.<br /><br />Also, he spent almost 10 mins in EACH lecture, YES, every lecture he had to mention about the grouping and wasted few mins, which I think can be done through Canvas and not waste everyone's time.",

SO I will stick to the official grading from the course outline.I guess the TAs weren't so sure about what they were doing as well.<br /><br />My grade: C+ (◐‿◑)﻿",
            "comment_workload": "I think the course took a weird turn to decide to choose a project to fuck everyone up as we couldn't do a physical examination during the pandemic. Quoting from the lecturer, he said the reason to not have exams was that it would be unfair to have an online exam where someone might cheat. I completely understand the rationale behind it but I believe it is also unfair to those who were fucked by the poor arrangement of the project ( that is 40% of the grade!! ). As mentioned in a recent review of this course, the lab details were not released until the very end of the course. And the project was also a fucking mess that we had to find specs about an industrial-use induction motor with all info required to perform the calculations. So good luck to those who will take this course. Unless they change the course grading to not include such messed up project or they find other ways to torture our students.",

I recommend you not attending the lesson as it is a waste of time, you never understand his accent unless you are nds. Just go to search for some related youtube videos online and it is totally enough for this course. <br />The tutorial sessions are better than the lectures, yet they are not the greatest, so if you have spare time you can go, but it is still fine if you do not go",
            "comment_grading": "Typical grading for mech courses, you basically get a B (or B-?) if you reach the mean. The mean for the mid-term is around 70, and I believe if you understand the content well, you can easily get above 90 as the questions in both mid-term and final is not hard. Also remember to print the solution manual provided in Canvas if you want to score a high mark.",

Although this course has no pre-requisite, it requires a lot of background knowledge of electromagnetism as we will use equivalent circuit models in the analysis. It is better to include a chapter on reviewing the fundamentals before going into the real content. If you have studied PHYS1114, then it will be fine and you are likely to survive in this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "The prof always talked about his 'own' idea, but if you have a solid knowledge on electric circuits, you can also think about those on your own. He should speed up a little bit instead of too focusing on one aspect. But his english is fine.",

Also, read the textbook on your own to get a clearer idea as the prof only speaks briefly on some concepts. The exams are open-book but be prepared to have a &quot;chur&quot; midterm as I don't have enough time finishing it. The final is reasonable.<br /><br />The 2 lab reports are just fill in the blanks and easy calculations.",
