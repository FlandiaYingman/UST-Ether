I got lucky the lectures were recorded.<br /><br />But Jeff's quite easy going, letting us know what he's testing us in the final exam.<br /><br />The TA is helpful, although she may not have enough understanding to the topics. She simply recap the class content and did not extract/explain the knowledge in her own way.",
