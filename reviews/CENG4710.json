Prior knowledge of separation would be helpful but not necessary. However, the lecture notes are LITERALLY ripped off from the 1998 version of the reference textbook. So if you can get that, forget the lecture notes.",
            "comment_teaching": "I can't seem to say just how shitty this professor is. He basically just reads of the lecture notes and derives equations throughout the whole class. He doesn't teach a single damn thing. You'd learn just as much by studying alone with his lecture notes.<br /><br />Sadly he's sort of non-replaceable in the department due to his reputation of having lots of research publications. Just pray some new professor gets assigned to teach this class.",
