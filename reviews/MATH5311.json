            "comment_content": "The material is not that easy to read, for an engineering student. There are several applications that are very theoretical and I would say not very appropriate for my purpose. However, I do think that for someone from a math background, it is okay and is very detailed.<br /><br />I think the course covered the main differential equations. I just think that there should be more lessons on how to apply it well, especially in certain kinds of engineering equations and scenarios.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is good in teaching and is very enthusiastic. What I like about him is he seems to be really enjoying what he teaches. He shows up on time in class and is always available for consultation. He explains concepts well but for very complex ones, he has a hard time explaining it to students from non-math backgrounds.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is okay and quite lenient, but still is fair. For instance, a well-done homework normally receives around 9/10 or 10/10. The grading also takes too long, probably at the end of the term. So you don't have a good gauge on how your grades are.",
            "comment_workload": "For me, I think there are too many homework, considering this is a PG course. Although I have expected it based on stories by other students. There are many homework that are given weekly or every other week. Each homework typically has 3-4 questions, but they have sub-questions, which make them longer. There is also a final project wherein you have to choose any differential equation from your field and present your numerical assessment about it. It's quite flexible, which is pretty nice.",
