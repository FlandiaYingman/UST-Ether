        "description": "This course introduces seven state-of-the-art additive manufacturing (AM) technologies that apply to various materials. The physical principle, theoretical modeling, and the effects of different process parameters are derived and analyzed. Based on the knowledge of the AM processes, computer-aided tools, and specific design principles for AM are also discussed. Among the design guidelines, the concept and practices of topology optimization are highlighted. The students will learn to generate structurally optimal designs based on loads, constraints, and other required product performance and manufacturing conditions. The course also provides experimental sessions to manufacture the structural optimized parts with either metal selective laser sintering or continuous fiber-reinforced additive manufacturing.",
