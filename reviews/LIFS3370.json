Students will work in groups to devise a mini‚Äêlaboratory course for detecting human genetic variants. They will then serve as instructors of the course in outreach workshops for high school students. Approval of the course instructor is needed for students to enroll in this course. For LIFS students only.",

A laboratory manual will be composed by the students, which will be used in outreach workshops for participants from high schools. Students will be trained to give introductory presentations and laboratory instructions effectively prior to the workshops. &quot;<br /><br />So basically, you will:<br />- Work out with SNPs<br />- Learn how to design primers<br />- Optimizing lab protocol (DNA extraction, purification etc)<br />- Make a lab manual <br />- Do a few presentations<br />- Carry out a workshop<br /><br />If you are a experience learning guy like me, you will love this course. Even though you have merely no lab experience, like most of us under the covid-setting. You will be fine in here.",
            "comment_teaching": "Both of them are dedicated in this course and they teach especially well both in tutorials and the lab settings. You will learn quite a lot of practical skills.<br /><br />Prof Mak always said that he will give brutal advise and questions, but to be frank, he is very nice.",

            "comment_workload": "When the workload of this course is light, only need to do a few presentations and the lab manual. Especially you are one of the BIBU students, preparing slides is just a piece of cake for you.<br /><br />One thing to take home is that, finding teammate who is good at present and teaching is kinda essential, so try to mingle with your classmates at the beginning of the course. You won't want a teammate who will brings negative effect to your presentation and your lab work. <br /><br />But its kinda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t i m e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c o n s u m i n g&nbsp;&nbsp;, you are expected to come to the lab to test out the protocol and primers 3-6 hours per week. Moreover, there will be a workshop right before the study break, making your study schedule extra tight.",
