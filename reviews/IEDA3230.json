However, I'm so disappointed in the way it's taught. The course can be taught in a much more entertaining fashion.<br /><br />The important skills for this course are &quot;Math&quot; and &quot;Reading&quot; skills.",
            "comment_teaching": "Our professor seemed to have some level of passion when teaching. Also, he would give us real-life examples and also tell us some of his own interesting life lessons. To be honest, I sincerely believe he is a great person with good intrinsic values.<br /> <br />Apart from this, the teaching part was torture for me. To begin with, I can't ever stay focused in his class because of his monotonous tone. I literally do not remember a single class where I did not fall asleep towards the end. In addition, the IPRS questions are needlessly way too difficult, which does not help when I want to stay awake. For the later parts of the course, I had to search google and discuss with classmates to fully grasp the concepts because his explanations were a bit too....abstract.<br /><br />The icing on the cake was that I would sometimes ask questions during class via zoom chat, only for the majority of my questions to be ignored. Maybe he thought my questions were pointless :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ouch)<br /><br />Our TA, Joy, on the other hand, was great. She would give me satisfying explanations whenever I had any questions in the lecture notes.",

            "title": "quite confusing",
            "comment_content": "Topics: cost terminology, profit and revenue maximization, cost driven design, time value of money (cash flows including compounding, annuity, gradient, continuous compounding, equivalent cash flows), IRR&amp;ERR, accounting double entries, project comparisons (deterministic and probabilistic), ROSCA, decision tree, options and portfolio management.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the topics themselves, but they were taught in such an odd approach. For examples, instead of going over the formula for the cash flows, the Professor encouraged to use some specific notation to check values from a 30-page long table. I suppose he doesn't want to overwhelm us with the derivation and stuff, but the notation can become very confusing sometimes. Other topics, like Options and Portfolio management, were very enjoyable as well. But due to the packed teaching schedule, he skimmed over options way too quickly in one class and I had to spend hours reading stuff up online afterwards to barely understand his notes.<br /><br />There's a project as well, and the guidelines are vague (just apply some concepts from class to evaluate an engineering project). Still to this day I have no idea how technical/business focused it should be (some people did lots of calculations, others did detailed SWOT analysis) and how big the scope should be.<br /><br />My main issue so far is that I can't understand a lot of their homework and exam questions (they are always written in confusing words). <br /><br />If there's one topic I found particularly amusing, it would be the time the Professor spent half an hour showing us how to calculate our present worth (at least 5 million dollars or something). I still remember him preaching to us that &quot;you are the most valuable investment.&quot;<br /><br />Overall, a course with great potential (like I can see why we need to learn most of these topics). I think by fine tuning the content, it could be a very wonderful course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Chen is a very nice, kindhearted and inspirational guy. You can tell he truly cares about his students and wants us to learn new things in his class. He shares genuine stories like his experiences with debt and gives life advice. He will also answer any questions patiently in class even if they are dumb. I guess sometimes students send chat messages to doubt his rationale but he will just say &quot;thank you for all your comments and suggestions&quot;. I really appreciate his effort and dedication in teaching.<br /><br />And the problem: it's impossible to stay focused in his classes. He has a tendency to mumble in monotone (which definitely doesn't help explaining the already confusing concepts) and he mostly states the concepts without explaining in detail. What's worse is that he has iPRS every class which is absolutely a torture. His questions are just as confusing and we are only given a short time to answer them. Or maybe I'm just dumb, but most of the time I have to random guess the answers.<br /><br />The TA, Joy, is very helpful most of the time. She replies to emails quickly and addresses our concerns almost instantly during the quizzes and final. She explains the practise and homework questions clearly as well.",

            "comment_workload": "Main workload is the project but it wasn't too much. Our group had around 3 short meetings and that was it. The final deliverable is only a 15 slide PowerPoint and a presentation, no report. Homework is also done in groups so each person only needs to attempt 1-2 questions. <br /><br />Not exactly workload, but frequency of iPRS and peer evaluation in this course is unusually high (multiple iPRS questions in one class, one iPeer per homework and 2 more for project, many many iPRS for peer evaluating other groups during presentations).",

But later (after final exam) I found out may be they didn't mark my MC because I answered the MC on question paper instead of answer paper (which is just a sheet of white paper, how am I supposed to answer MC there...). So make sure you ask for clarification right away and go to paper check if something don't make sense. <br /><br />You can also see grading isn't very transparent, there's no appeal session for final exam either. <br /><br />Nevertheless, I didn't work so hard in this course so I'm not super sad with this grade.",
