        "description": "Through real-time videoconferencing, this online course aims at helping students learn the definitions of global health ethics and bioethics, the protocol and systems in place to ensure adherence to ethical principles, and how different stakeholders and cultures may interpret ethics differently. This course is co-offered with the University of Southern California and involves universities in Mainland China, Mexico, and Philippines. Besides nine joint LIVE sessions, UST students will also meet the UST instructors face-to-face for the introduction of background knowledge, reading and understanding of cases, and technical support. Instructor's consent is needed.",
