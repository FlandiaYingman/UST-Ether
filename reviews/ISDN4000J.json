        "description": "A project-based, experiential learning course that introduces students to the basics of Eco-design. Eco-design is the practice of designing that focuses on the conservation, sustaining and propagating of Nature’s eco-systems. Given the current crisis of climate change and environmental degradation, students will learn how to use ideas and insights from ‘Science’, ‘Technology’, ‘Arts’, ‘Politics’, ‘Ethics’ and ‘Spirituality’*, to formulate concepts for products, services and/or communication strategies, that balance man-made needs with the integrity of natural eco-systems. Structured on the Design Thinking process, ideas from Circular Design, Design Futuring and Design Fictions will also be explored. Students will at the end of the course, be able to understand the interdisciplinarity and interrelatedness of Eco-design theory and practice and be able to use this understanding in their own daily practice and or chosen professions. Instructor's consent is required.",
