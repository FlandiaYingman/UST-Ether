        "description": "Even in the age of globalization and highly advanced communication and transportation technologies, human beings still belong to different groups, each with its own set of identifying markers and priorities. These human identities and groupings are fundamentally informed by their historical past. This course is an exploration of human society through a historical analysis of the roots of these broad categories that we use to organize ourselves. The first value of “identity and community” examines the formation and changes in basic categories of differences in human society. These categories include ethnic, religious, and linguistic differences that gave rise to varying layers of identities that each individual may possess. Exploring the second value, “contact and conflict,” entails analyzing how these differences in identities caused competition over ideologies and resources. Finally, understanding the value of “justice and resolution” is an investigation of the ways through which human beings have devised ways to resolve conflicts and disputes within and between groups.",

There are so many social phenomena that you didn't realize but did happen in your daily life. <br /><br />For example, how do we draw our boundaries? Would prefer to describe yourself as a son, student of HKUST, a citizen of HK V.S. China, or Asian? Even do we migrate into Japan, will we be accepted by the foreigners even though we are politically defined as Japanese? In Hong Kong, there are many races of people such as the Pakistanis, Indians, and the mainlander. Why still many Hong Kongers did not accept them? What makes us classify someone as an &quot;outsider&quot;?<br /><br />In terms of culture, the lecture content covers different cultures, ranging from Eze, France, Shirakawa-go, Fujian tulou, Regensburg, Venice, Qingming shanghe tu. It also covers the way culture transmit across the physical boundaries and the economic cycle of the ancient world, the function of the village, class, government, races, cities, states.<br /><br />Not only the historical events, but it also covers some current social issues. For example, the nuclear waste of Japan, WWII, nationalism, BLM, covid-19, and the US election, which will definitely make you have a better understanding and the way we look at our world.",

The professor will sometimes explain words in Cantonese and I can feel he is very passionate and professional in the Hong Kong culture and some social issues.<br /><br />However, you should always attend the lecture as the professor only put pictures in his PowerPoint slide with no details. My advice is to drop your own notes on your paper to record what he said in the lecture. You would be fine.",

Since the tutor is the one who grades your essay, you should follow his/her instruction even though you think those suggestions are not useful.&quot;<br /><br />************",

Please pay attention to both the essay part and the quiz as it counts 70% of your total grade given that everyone should be able to get full marks for the remaining 30%.",

My tutor is Mike, and he seemed to be mad all the time. Always questioning your approach but not giving constructive feedback.

Therefore, you may want to review lecture videos again after the lecture/before the quiz to understand what is happening.<br />Secondly, he teaches at a rather slow pace.

Of course, this really depends on your motivation to do so.<br /><br />For the Quiz, have fun doing HUMArathon before and note down what Lawerence said.

We cover sooo many topics and case studies that it's kinda annoying, but you're bound to learn something that interests you and will stick. If you've taken history/politics before, a lot of the case studies will be semi-review, though Lawrence goes in greater depth so you still need to pay attention as he brings up the dumbest small details in his midterm (ex. a question we had was &quot;Hong Xiuquan thought he was: a) jesus' brother, b) jesus' cousin, etc.)",
            "comment_teaching": "Lawrence is an interesting species of his own. After about 10 mins of him talking you can tell he went to Harvard (don't worry, if you don't figure it out yourself, he'll manage to remind you in every lecture, talking about his 'colleague from Harvard', 'professor from Harvard', etc). Half of the time it feels like he's flexing his knowledge rather than trying to actually teach you something useful. That being said, he is clearly very intelligent and a good lecturer. Still can be annoying though, especially when he trails off. I once saw the TA asleep during this kind of rambling session. Oh and don't think about talking in his lecture, he'll be sassy about it and call you out. Every. Single. Time. Better to sleep :)",
            "comment_grading": "Half of the grading is based on your essay, so if you can write a decent essay you're good. The one I wrote was definitely not one of my best, and I still got an A+, so clearly the standards aren't crazy high. International students have an edge here, as we've written a lot more essays in high school. Midterm I got 18/20 (mean was around 13). Full workshop attendance + full marks on the online tasks. Not sure what I scored in the discussions, but I posted around 7-8 comments for each one.",
            "comment_workload": "Not that bad, lecture is only once a week and attendance isn't taken. Workshops were every 3ish weeks, and our tutor let us out early each time. Most work went into the canvas discussions to be honest. Studying for midterm and writing the essay don't take too much time if you're efficient about it. Don't bother with the reading material by the way, no one reads it and it's pointless. There was 1/20 question on the midterm from the readings, but it was quite logical so people who didn't even read it could have guessed it easily.",

Identity conflicts between ethnic groups around the world in the past are still quite relatable to today's global affairs. You can see well the examples are quite all-rounded and carefully selected, like the Israel-Palestine conflicts last month, the US Parliament incident this year can show how identity in different aspects influence the ideological competition in these days.",
            "comment_teaching": "I think Prof. Lawrence Zhang provide a detailed insight on different aspects of identity issues, the associated historical &amp; ideological conflicts of the medieval and post-modern times, and the respective resolutions and trends. <br /><br />The course is somehow like a social science or history class rather than a rigorous humanities class I would say, since the topics are more like related to the historical development of the civilized society in medieval China &amp; Europe, viewing the topics from a historical and socio-political point of view may help. <br /><br />I would say the topics chosen are fine, the problem is the professor loves to show lots of picture (without words) in the class presentation and somehow the examples illustrated like those European Empires, Chinese royal states (he talks so much on the 康熙皇帝 清朝官廳 those stuffs) may find unfamiliar for most local students. If you follow the real-time lectures, you may find difficult to follow given you need to jot extra notes and listen to what he says (especially he often uses very specific terminologies &amp; uncommon vocabularies), and see the naughty kids kept yelling in the chat box !! so I suggest you to watch the after class lecture videos instead. <br /><br />For the writing tutorial, my tutor Graham is quite supportive and he often provides useful feedbacks on your essay progress. I worked on a quite distinctive case and we found it enjoyable.",
            "comment_grading": "Like the other HUMA 1000 courses, your essay almost defines your grade.

            "comment_workload": "The workload really depends on the efforts you have placed on the term essay and the Canvas Discussion forum, and also your preparation for the course quiz in the final teaching week. <br /><br />For me, I watched part of the lecture videos consecutively during Easter break, and some of the remaining videos I watched them around a week before the quiz. Because the quiz is open-book Multiple choice questions, you better prepare a tailor-made notes to jot down the definitions and examples illustrated during lectures. <br /><br />For Canvas discussion forum, a total of three forums was assigned which lasted for two weeks each. You just shared your views promptly with supporting arguments and references, and replied to your tutorial students regularly. I saw someone replied crazily but I think it's just not necessary. For me, I posted 3 feeds on the first forum, 7 feeds on the second forum (about meritocracy) and only 2 feeds on the final forum. Not replying too late would be fine. <br /><br />Your essay depends on how you defined the topic you would like to focus on from the essay prompts given. Before each writing tutorial, you were supposed to submit the Canvas workshop quizzes and should have submitted a partial contribution of your essay. The tutor then provided you the feedbacks. Just don't make silly mistakes and submit all on time will be fine. <br />The tutor and professor would send you timely emails on how you can work on your essay, and they are likely to discuss with you by appointment. <br /><br />Suggestions on essay: <br />You better choose a topic focus and case that you are very familiar or confident with (for local I suggest working on local identity issue or those you have well heard of). <br />Don't bother defining your thesis in a very vague and unrealistic manner. There are lots of flexibility for you to show your views and supporting arguments promptly. <br /><br />Or else you will be someone who always complain you are a revision jj and no nuinui, while that guy ends up very poor grade, delivering goods all day long and got brainwashed with sinovac",

The prof would relate the content back to Hong Kong issues and society, which definitely makes people a lot more aware. <br /><br />The tutorial content is unnecessary and a waste of time, especially if english is your first language. you go through a few classes just to learn how to write something persuasive... from introduction to conclusion.

Just go to the lectures, it's the most efficient way to get a good grade. The readings were interesting though! <br /><br />Discussions are also very straight forward, you just talk about your opinion on certain topics and reply to a few others, which may lead to some very interesting conversations! <br /><br />The online quizzes that you have to submit is crazy simple... you don't even need to read the supporting document to understand how to answer the questions.

Therefore I basically skipped all the lecture and watched them at home at 2x speed to save time.<br /><br />However, the TA is horrible!!!! My TA is HO, Susanna Pui San. She only focus on her schedule and do not care about student's need and opinion. Whenever she is asked about the final essay writing, she will reply &quot;You should ask the professor about that&quot; and give no help on the writing. Yet she always heavily comment on student's work while not providing any feasible solution to help students. Overall, it feels like she has this fixed mind set on how to do the essay and do not value student's own opinion and perspective. Basically whole class don't like her and everyone roll eye as freak during her class. Reminds me of sh** English teacher from HK local schools.",

Little effort is needed to complete parts other than essay. Yet this course do require a more international perspective to discuss the topic of identity and community.<br /><br />I am bad at writing argumentative essay, therefore despite I did rest of the stuff decently, I only got an C+",

You will see locals and non-locals arguing some cool things with each other and within the group.<br />One of the most interesting things I saw is that they argued shd ppl who don't wear mask being punished, and one of the ppl related it to smoking.

            "comment_content": "Lecture Content:<br />Content is good but heavy memorization and very loong content. Myself got almost fallen asleep because the content is soo loong loll <br />There are lecture videos on canvas and optional reading for each modules. Basically it talks mostly about types of communities (families, villages, states, nations).<br /><br />Essay writing content is also good bc its pretty easy if u like writing/reading and explained very clear. There is the materials of writing attached too in Canvas. There are 3 topic questions u can choose to answer for your essay",
            "comment_teaching": "Lecture Teaching is good and explained well. Prof. Zhang usually give 5-10 minutes breaks in the midst of class so u can refresh urself first. He is also open to questions too<br /><br />My Class TA is Ms. Angie LI. She is a good professor and willing to answer questions from students. She also explains the essay making steps very well, so that I understand easily.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is overall good as long as you keep track of the online discussion and online workshop deadlines in Canvas. Be careful to not miss any deadlines or it will cause a significant impact on your final grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Syllabus<br />20% 1 In Class Quiz <br />10% 3 Canvas Online Discussions<br />10% Canvas Online Writing Workshops<br />10% In Class Writing Workshops<br />50% Term Essay - submitted through turnitin same like LANG1002/3<br /><br />Luckily there are no midterm or finals",
            "comment_workload": "Overall, the workload is pretty heavy, given last semester I also had to take other heavy-workload courses such as MGMT2010 and ISOM2010. <br />However, as long as you manage time well and work consistently on the assignment due deadline dates through beginning to mid of course, you will be able to catch up on revising the final essay during the end of the term.<br /><br /><br />There are 3 Online Discussions throughout the semester (you have to post frequently bc your TA is going to check and review your comments, each discussion's deadline is approximately 12 days);<br /><br />5 In Class Writing Workshops (Mandatory Attendance and make sure to come no more late than 15 minutes, otherwise you will lose your attendance mark), and for my tutorial section it was actually split into 2 groups (1st session comes earlier and 2nd section comes later). And you have to bring your own laptop too<br /><br />Online Writing Workshops, do not submit late bc it may decrease your final grade. <br /><br />Final essay - The most influential impact on your grade (it weighs for the half of final grade!). Make sure to not miss any assignments bc you need to revise it in short time before the final draft and exact final essay submission date. And you need to list your revision efforts in the front of final essay's cover page. If u submit the final essay late from the deadline, you may not get A range.<br /><br />Quiz - This is the only part that is acceptable i think (and the small percentage so it is not that impactful as final essay). (I did poor on the quiz :(( ) But make sure u prepare the materials bc there is a lot of memorization cuz the quiz has many trapping questions. Quiz structure is informed through last lecture class bfr quiz and itsc email.<br /><br />btw for my lecture class, the lecture attendance is not needed.",
