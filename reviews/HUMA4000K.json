        "name": "New Perspectives on Suicide Terrorism: Global View with Emphasis on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict",
        "description": "This course offers a social-scientific study of political violence, terrorism, and suicide terrorism in the world, particularly in the Middle East. Suicide terrorism is enigmatic and extraordinarily lethal phenomenon, historically unique, extending over to more than forty countries (including China, US, India, France, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Iraq). The course presents a comparative-theoretical analysis based on real-time close-range investigation of Palestinian terrorism attacks in Israel during the Intifada, focusing on the arena of explosion where the disguised perpetrator and his/her target meet. Exploration of suicide terrorism uses firsthand materials produced by unconventional research methods and hitherto classified sources, revising the current discussion on the strategic logic of suicide terrorism and suggesting original insights on its moral logic. Suicide terrorism's exceptionally coercive as well as subversive impact is explained in terms of its paradoxical nature; especially the peculiar inherent link between aggressor and victim. The course draws from a forthcoming book - The Smile of the Human Bomb.",
