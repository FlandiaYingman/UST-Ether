Only 2 MC questions per quiz.<br />The simulation game could be time consuming, as you need to check and try for the best strategy. To run it once, my group used around 3-4 hours, as discussions involved. It will be held near to your final project presentation, so better finished your PPT and everything earlier before your Simulation Game.",

A couple of cases and examples are introduced to facilitate students' understandings on the operations level of different drivers (e.g. Zara, 7-11). Also, you will have chances to implement what you have learnt in 3 different simulation games. You will find it interesting since you are not just learning concepts/textbook facts, you can also try to apply them and figure out the positive/negative consequences. The applications of Math involved in this course are quite simple. All of the calculations are based on newsvendor model and EOQ model (as mentioned in ISOM2700). No worries if you are weak in Math.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Wang is excellent in teaching. She explained everything in a very detailed and organized way.

The assignments are not difficult, tutorials will help a lot if you encounter some challenging questions in assignments. For midterm and final exams, you are provided with sufficient time, so try to be as careful as possible to obtain a good score. The questions will not trick you with the measuring units, but the questions may challenge/trick you with the concepts! Also, I advise you to pay attention in class since some of the easy credits in exams will be from the videos professor played / examples or cases that professor introduced. Overall, the exam is quite easy and the mean is reasonably high.",
