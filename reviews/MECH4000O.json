        "description": "This course serves as a general introduction to the underlying concepts of state-of-the-art additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. A wide range of representative processes (including fused deposition modeling, material jetting, selective laser sintering, direct energy deposition, stereolithography, digital light processing) is discussed in the AM of different materials. The physical principle, theoretical modeling, and the effects of different process parameters are derived and analyzed. Building on the knowledge of AM process, the computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) are reviewed; specific design principles for AM are discussed. The students are also expected to have hands-on experience with the AM machines through the design, fabrication, and measurement of parts. Besides AM, other representative rapid prototyping techniques (e.g., incremental forming) are also briefly discussed.",

Overall I am pretty enjoyed during the project.",
