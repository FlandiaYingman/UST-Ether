            "comment_content": "Mainly circles around basic design and manufacturing knowledge. But they are completely incoherent and irrelevant to each other (basically useless), making the content the worst part of this course.<br /><br />The labs are a bit better but that's not saying much, revolves around simple techniques on using solid works and drawing components and mating them together. Can be fun at times but most of the time you would be dealing with bugs which can be really frustrating.<br /><br />And the most useless part of the course: we were required to submit a report on how to build a new pedal kart that has better functionality. You'll learn basically 0 knowledge in this part and just try to compile a bunch of useless knowledge together just to reach the 40 pages mark. They want you to come up with innovations for a pedal kart but since its such an old and ubiquitous technology you'll have a really hard time trying to find ways to do just that.",
            "comment_teaching": "Attended the lectures once and never attended them again, the lecturer was basically mumbling on his own and it was extremely difficult to understand him given his heavy accent. The ppts were also just a bunch of random information combined, making it really hard to know what were the main takeaways in each lecture (if any).<br /><br />Labs were okay, though the TA taught really slowly and once helped a student debug his drawing for 20 minutes, leading to a 30 minutes delay of the class, (Delays happen almost every lab session)<br /><br />Also, no clear instructions were ever given on how the report was to be done, a blurred outline only emerged after students bombarded their questions on the discussion board, still, most of us had no idea what was expected from us.",
            "comment_grading": "The quiz accounted for 20% of the course, and it revolved around random pages on the ppt slides and was, again, basically useless. One question required you to recite the modulus of elasticity of steel and aluminium and I for one cannot see the value of testing student's ability to memorise an entire property table.<br /><br />The other 80% comes from the group project, although no clear instructions were given, you could still have a decent mark if your groupmates were decent enough since nobody had any idea what we were supposed to do anyway",
            "comment_workload": "The individual report takes most of the workload, you will be required to come up with 40 pages of pure BS since no directions were given, you'll probably spend half of the time wondering what you're supposed to do.<br /><br />The group report was a bit better since you basically just pick the best BS among yourselves and compile it into another report.<br /><br />There will also be a presentation of your ideas, which doesn't really matter that much as long as your report is good enough.<br /><br />Weekly solid works assignments will also sometimes be given though those are usually relatively easy.",

These powerpoints are useless in learning as you cannot understand the teaching material by only looking at those ppts. Some of them are even vague even you go to lectures on time to listen to the lecturer's explanations, which makes great confusion to students as there are no clear examples.<br /><br />The labs were better, you can understand the basic solidwork skills when you attend all the labs. However, this is definitely not enough for students to the pedal kart solidwork drawings, i.e. the skill of advance mating and analysis of forces, stresses in parts drawing. <br />The angriest part in this course is that most of the pedal kart subsystem details were taught after the submission of the phase one report, and lecture does not provide any useful resources or examples for the pedal kart report, which make students frustrated in its content, and it is even a COMPULSORY course.",

However, it is hard to catch up(don't know it is whether my problem or not) the solidworks step once students were not focusing on his drawing and may miss some of the important steps. It is preferable to look at the lab recording if students cannot follow up in the lab live and feel inconvenient to ask questions while disturbing other's procedures. <br /><br />Conclusion: watch lab record, and lectures are useless",

These questions are meaningless like asking for the elastic modulus of iron alloy and recognize the stress-strain curve for a particular type of material. Unless you cheated or you are talented like Asperger syndrome that can memorize all detail at once you see the PowerPoint slide, you are not going to make them correct.<br /><br />Reports: You are going to make a pedal kart for racing and you have to submit a report for the design analysis of your design of pedal kart including the plan of the subsystem in phase one (40 pages), and another group report for the finalized design of pedal kart including the integration of the subsystems from teammates.(45pages) And finally, a 15 minutes' present for the pedal kart students design. Since there is little information provided by tutors to guide the students' pedal kart design, students are less likely to take marks by both reports and presents. <br /><br />Conclusion: your marks gonna be low due to this stupid course grading which is tailor-made to bully students",

The tutor will remind students to prepare for the phase 1 report 3 weeks before they submit, but it is not enough as students have to type 45 pages and to research for many subsystems. The deadline of report crash with the date of the quizzes by themselves and making the workload of the report's deadline week huge, making most students give up for the preparation of the quiz. Moreover, the instruction from the notes provides by the tutor contradicts with the tutor's words on the phase 1 report workload explanation. This increases students' workload a lot.<br /><br />Phase 2 report was mainly based on phase 1 and the workload is relatively smaller than phase1, but it is hard to &quot;blow water&quot;, i.e. students have to give data like numbers to explain the design, which is hard to work on.<br /><br />The presentation is different from the report that many of the parts cannot directly copy from the phase 2 report, telling you that the report that students had made is meaningless.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Lab is the easiest part if students do the assignment on time by spending 1-2 hours. <br /><br />Overall the workload is extremely high due to the meaningless report that used up your quiz revision time.

Since there is no exam and there are no assessments regarding the material covered in class, there is simply no reason to attend the classes unless you are eager to learn and is willing to wake up for a 9am lesson. I personally did not have the endurance it takes.<br /><br />2: Labs<br />This is the key part of the course. It takes you thought the things you need to know in Solidworks, which is what the course is built around. You will be have to attend every one of them (or attempt to attend every one of them). They are pretty useful, and you simply have to follow video instructions which provide step by step guidance. (And Stanley is very friendly so you can just ask if anything comes up)<br /><br />3: Online Lectures<br />This is where it gets weird. The online lectures are compulsory, since every week there have been quizzes about the online quizzes. They generally introduce concepts of manufacturing and processes, which have nothing to do with the final project.",

TBH I expected myself to bomb my design assignment as I was very struggling with it as I'm so bad at solidworks. But the grace of God was with me as I did it.<br /><br />是祢的恩典覆蓋<br />是祢不止息的厚愛&nbsp;&nbsp;如深海<br />是祢的恩手拖帶<br />來讓我敞開心扉讚美 從不息",

Learn knowledges about manufacturing and assembling, eg specifications, manufacture &amp; assemble methods<br />3. Design a pedal kart for a competition<br /><br />In the course, 1 and 3 will be talked about in lab sessions, while 2 is from the lectures.<br /><br />1. SolidWorks<br />In the lab session, TA will teach you how to use basic functions of SolidWorks to do simple 3D drawings, such as drawing, extruding, evaluating mass and cog etc.<br />Each lab will include a piece of 3D drawing with specifications, and you have to submit it as lab assignment. Some of the lab sessions are drawing practice and one drawing test, so there are only a few lessons that you will be actually learning 3D drawing. <br /><br />2. Lectures<br />The lectures talk about various information about manufacturing and assembling. It is all on a powerpoint, so I mainly read the powerpoint instead of going to the lecture.<br /><br />3. Pedal Kart Design<br />In some of the lab sessions will talk about this. Details will be put onto the grading and workload part.",
            "comment_teaching": "I do not have many things to say about the professor, anyway he is good in representing the things on the powerpoint clearly, and TAs in lab session are helpful too.",
            "comment_grading": "Due to the pandemic the grading is as follows:<br /><br />20% Quiz (2 x 10%)<br />80% Project (Report + Presentation)<br /><br />The quiz is done in an online proctored mode where you have to put a camera in a unaccessable location on your small desk so that your camera can both view your face and the computer screen. The quiz is not very hard, but it requires you to memorize almost every tiny details on the powerpoint.<br /><br />The project is spilt into 3 parts. I do not exactly remember the grading percentages, but it includes 1 individual report + 1 group report + 1 group presentation. So if you are not required to take this course and you cannot find friends to take together, please go away.<br /><br />The project is as trash as you can imagine. Details on workload part.<br /><br />Grading is not yet being released when I write this, but I can expect what it will be.",
            "comment_workload": "This is where the course become complete shit.<br />The quizzes do not require a lot of time to do revision so I will put this aside.<br /><br />The project contributes to 80% of your total grading and consists of 3 parts.<br /><br />1. Phase I (Individual report)<br />This is the easier part, where you have to design a pedal kart to join the 24-hr pedal kart grand prix in Hong Kong, and submit a 40 page report about it.<br />In this stage you have to give relevant information, related technologies, and detailed design on your pedal kart. You need to include some hand drawing and sketches to interpret your idea. I spend about 4-5 days to rush this, since you have to go find all of the relevant technologies, and each system of your kart like steering, wheels, chassis et cetera, and you have to include a multiple version of each system and then evaluate which one is the best on your kart.<br /><br />2. Phase II (Group Report)<br />In this part you will form groups with 3-4 people, and then design a pedal kart out of almost thin air. This time you cannot include your ugly hand sketches, but instead 3D drawings and detailed specifications, also manufacturing methods and assembly considerations, and you need to compress them to about 50 pages.<br />The major workload comes from the 3D drawing. Without much knowledge from the solidworks, and this requires us to design a complex pedal kart, with many functions such as making gears not yet learned.",
