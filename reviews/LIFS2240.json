            "comment_teaching": "The tutorial is held by LAM and the lab session is taught by AMIN. <br />The tutorial is clear and informative, just like that of LIFS2820. Dr. LAM also provides guidelines for writing reports and some hints/tips for the final exam. Dr. Amin is quite humorous and makes vivid explanations.<br />Students are divided into groups of 6 by the instructor (yes you cannot choose your teammates), which made the bench quite crowded. While this allows teamwork and cooperation, it may also cause chaos, and you may not have the chance to participate in each part of the experiment. (can be either good or bad)<br />Another thing worth mentioning is that maybe because of there are too many people, some operations are really not standard... In most of the experiments, we are not even given gloves... (even when doing cell culture) (is ust that poor?) And some TAs doesn't seem to know what we are doing, although they are supposed to help and guide us.",

The report is kinda annoying because you really don't have many things to write for such a simple experiment of observing cells...&nbsp;&nbsp;And the TAs deducted my mark because I didn't include references...<br />Just a suggestion, reading the lab manual and doing a bit of research on things you don't know should be helpful for knowing what you are doing in the lab session and in completing the writeups.",

It's difficult for every group member to be able to take part in the experiments and learn out of it.",
