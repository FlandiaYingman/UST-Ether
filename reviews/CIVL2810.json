They cover additional content that is barely mentioned in the lectures and serve to further enrich your knowledge about the topic.<br /><br />Apart from lectures and tutorials, there are also laboratory sessions, which revolve around the topic of concrete testing. This involves mixing concrete and later conducting the various tests on the concrete we have made. At the end of the semester, each group would have to present their findings to the others in their session.<br /><br />Important Note: Since the laboratory courses involve dealing with concrete, you need to wear safety shoes in order to participate in the laboratory sessions (which take attendance). The ones you have used in CIVL 2020 will do.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor does a great job at explaining things during the lectures and tutorials, using demos when necessary. The only critique I have is that the PowerPoints are very wordy and have little color - they might as well be summary notes for the course.<br /><br />If the lectures and tutorials are not enough, the professor has also uploaded his own notes as well as some textbook chapters on Canvas for our reference. I personally read them all as part of my revision and found them just as useful as re-watching the lecture videos.<br /><br />The TAs in the laboratory sessions have put in considerable effort and are helpful in general, but their instructions were occasionally unclear.",

It is designed to be both comprehensive and in-depth, so the difficulty is relatively high.<br /><br />Due to the cancellation of face-to-face sessions this semester, the professor provided a special arrangement which gave us the choice of either taking an open-book online exam at the original time with P/F grades, or taking an closed-book on-campus exam during the start of Spring term with A-F grades (even though that finally turned into an open-book online exam due to the coronavirus outbreak).<br /><br />To avoid being unfair to those who chose the second option, the professor mentioned that he would use the scores from last year as a reference when determining students' grades. Judging from the reviews last year, it was pretty good. Personally, I got an A after choosing the second option, though I have no idea what my scores are.",

Therefore, I think it was difficult.<br /><br />Concrete part involve a little bit of chemistry, but generally just memorize is ok.<br /><br />Material part... well just memorize la. You get nothing to do.",

(just kidding) It is because tutorials will teach you something which won't be included in lecture notes, such as calculations. You will need to use them in hw and exams. <br /><br />I think both profs are great. They host their tutorial sessions by themselves.<br /><br />However, the TAs were another disaster.",

I suggest you to understand what is going on b4 you copy it. :)<br /><br />Lab report. Difficult == Again la, be careful of freeriders and trash teammates. You will be assigned into groups with random ppl, so just pure luck.<br /><br />Presentation: on9 TA will ask you on9 questions ==. He asked me about the actual size of the aggregates while the lab manual only mentioned that it is coarse aggregates. How can I answer your nonsense question ==. I just pissed off and tell him I don't know. Make good use of your SFQ:) <br /><br />Exam: umm... I think it will be better to have midterm exam for this course. It is because the course covered a lot of content. Although Christopher provided a topic list for us, we still confused about which part is important. Moreover, I think midterm will provide you a chance to practice what you have learnt.",
