            "comment_teaching": "TLDR: skip all lectures, learn from youtube<br /><br />attending lectures is a waste of time because:<br />1. He frequently calculates things wrong and wastes time on finding the problem. Also, much time is spent waiting for him to recall the method. (For example, I remember he spend more than 10 minutes on recalling the proof of variation of parameter)<br /><br />2. 99% of things taught in lectures won't exist in exams. The only thing you need for the exam is the formulae (general solutions). It saves you more than 50% ~ 90% of the time. I am not saying that the lecture content is not important, but it is very not motivated to learn something that is not fun at all (just some computation stuff) and will not exist in exams.<br /><br />btw what I believe what I write in the content part should be included with everything needed to memorize already.<br /><br />2.5 His lecture is not good (not bad at all, but not good enough that it makes you want to join his lecture, esp. when it is a 9 am lecture)<br /><br />3. If you still can't understand, you can refer to Jeff Chasnov's and blackpenredpen's youtube channels, things are clearly explained there. (btw bprp use methods like partial fraction and completing the square to do those convolution question and I think it is good for the student that not good at integration.)<br /><br />Jeff (Recommended by TK Lam, very good)<br />https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZjai-2JcxlvaV9EUgtHj1KV7THMPw1w<br /><br />Blackpenredpen<br />https://www.youtube.com/c/blackpenredpen/playlists?view=50&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=5<br /><br />Also, I learn the Frobenius method here:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yaebm1Gs7Ns&amp;t=1499s&amp;ab_channel=DanielAn<br /><br />I learn system of ode with repeated eigvalue here:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCShTLmeZN4&amp;t=746s&amp;ab_channel=EricCytrynbaum<br /><br />tbh I may give a C/D to the teaching, but considering that it does not affect me at all, I'd give it a B",

Under these conditions, including the time for learning, I still spend less than 5 hours on each homework, and avg should be 3 hours I guess, so I spend 18 hrs in total on this course this semester, i.e. 1.5 hours per week. I believe for most of you, it is lower than most of your time consumption on a common core.<br /><br />Midterm and final are quite ez so revision is not required if you are not bad at computation. (I need to revise a little because I am bad though)<br /><br />Even if you are bad at it, I think one hour of practice per week is enough for the A range. Note that even if you spend one hour on practicing per week, you still spend 2.5hrs per week only :)<br />(recall: it is a 4 cred course)",

It means the numerical method part in course description would not be tested.<br />- All those existence, uniqueness thm mentioned in textbook<br />- Graph for describing solutions<br />- high order eqt, high order system. It means even there are matrices in exam, they would not be 3-by-3 or above<br />- PDE. It means the Sturm-Liouville theory, boundary value problems in the course description would not be tested. <br />- Advanced linear algebra like canonical form. Anything harder than the material in a first course of linear algebra (math 2111/21) are certainly not needed.<br /><br />As the most complicated topics being excluded, it turns out that thz course afterall is not that hard. In some senses it may be easier than the non-math-maj version of thz course, which is math2351. It is actually gd becoz you can earn a grade for a 4-cred course with a 3-cred effort.",
            "comment_teaching": "Never attend any lectures or tutorial. Just feel not worth spending my summer time for such a computation course... But I did email the prof, asking him some confusing stuff. And i think his teaching or advice is quite okay. And his lecture notes did cover things that are essential to exams. Also those tutorial exercises (which can all be accessed online) are quite useful. So i give it a B to his teaching.",

No sd is given, probably becoz of the small class size. <br /><br />I dont know others mark, but i can tell you mine. My mark is 73/95 in exam, and 5 + 73 = 78/100 in total.&nbsp;&nbsp;And my final grade is A. <br /><br />What i m saying is, it can be a gd-grade course, or a bad, all-or-nothing course for different ppl.",
            "comment_workload": "There are 0% attendence, 0% proj, ... in the grading policy. In some sense these make the course sufferable and enroll-able. But notice that the final exam is on an all-or-nothing basis. One cannot simply go for it with only little efforts on those webwork and tutorials. <br /><br />My advice is, <br />(i) do revise all the essential linear algebra material. You may not need to diagonalise a matrix, but you do need to know how to solve eqts, determine independence, and handle eigen concepts.<br />(ii) revise the material in calculus I &amp; II. Mastering 1013/14 or 1023/24 material is a must for you to succeed in this course. A bit of multi-variable functions and chain rule is useful, but not that necessay.<br />(iii) pay attention to the “physics” problems. I once worried my failure on problems like that on my final exam would lead me to a bad grade... So do revise all the tricks and skills for setting up a solvable equation. <br />(iv) take the final exam seriously!!! This point is one thing that really I cannot emphasis more. Sometimes if you think you dont hv enough time to do revision, just skip lessons. It can definitely make you more effcient in learning (and relaxing~~).",

(Well, this also means that you are welcomed to take the course even without the prerequisite.)<br /><br />Tutorial sessions will be great if you are struggling to understand the concepts during lectures or want more practice or advice.

Also, many of the methods in solving a single equation (e.g. undetermined coefficients; variation of parameters) can be generalised to a system of equations.<br /><br />Series solutions are the hardest part of the course, however they were never tested in exams.

            "comment_content": "Since it was a summer course, the content was not much comparing to a spring course. There are some similarities and differences.<br /><br />The first chapter focuses on first order differential equation. Topics include:<br />1. First order linear differential equations that can be solved by using integrating factors and by the converse of product rule.<br />2. Separable Equations, simply integrate both sides with respect to the related variables.<br />3. Homogeneous equations, i.e. the differential equation has the property h(x,y) = h(tx,ty) that can be solved by substitute y=xv, and by product rule can make h be either linear or separable.<br />4. Exact Equation, that means you can directly think the original equation that satisfy the problem, this part you should practice more.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Second Order Differential Equations<br />Topics: <br />1. Homogeneous Equation with constant coefficients. The skill is to solve quadratic equations, and remember those solutions for three situations, two distinct real roots, repeated real roots and no real roots.<br />2. Inhomogeneous Equations, you have to guess the original form and solve the coefficients, or using W(x,y), the determinant skill.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Laplace Transform<br />I think we should remember the Laplace Transform Table like we have to memorize the first 20 elements in periodic table in secondary school, but the instructor said he would provide the table in the exam which surprised me.<br /><br />This part introduces a new skill that can transform the ode to another question that simplifies the work. Generally, Laplace Transform can solve higher order differential equations but the instructor only asked us to solve second order differential equations.<br /><br />Chapter 4: System of homogeneous and inhomogeneous<br />This part is mainly focusing on solving matrices and dealing with eigenvalues and eigenvectors.<br /><br />Lastly, if you have no concepts on linear algebra, I recommend you to take course that cover basic linear algebra first, otherwise, you may be confused when you faced questions of chapter 4.<br /><br />Instructor provided lots of examples but some of them were Physics questions. Of course, ODE is used to solve Physics problems.",
            "comment_teaching": "Avery Ching is a good teacher but not a good professor. <br /><br />He focused on the steps in your solution and you cannot argue anything on his marking at all.<br /><br />When you ask him questions, he cannot provide you an accurate answer, or in Cantonese, we say he is 九唔搭八.<br />When I learned the topic first order differential equation, we may get troublesome in adding or not adding an absolute sign when integrating 1/x for example. In his solution, he did not add the absolute sign.<br /><br />He taught lots of Physics questions during lessons, although ODE is really used to solve Physics questions, this is a Mathematics course not &quot;ODE solving Physics Problems&quot;. I think he should spend more time in teaching ODE but not those questions. The time he spent on those Physics questions was enough for him to teach a new chapter.<br /><br />I think I am only a half of water in a cup, in Cantonese 半桶水. So, if you really want to learn differential equations, I recommend you to take the course in Spring semester not in Summer.",
            "comment_grading": "Webwork: 5%<br />Final Exam: 95%<br /><br />Since this was a summer course, it was impossible to organize a summer midterm exam that wastes time. The instructor did not clearly tell us the detail on grading but I think it should be graded by curve.<br /><br />Mean for the exam is around 66/95, checked in grading system so I don't know the variation. by the way, this was a small class, using normal distribution to guess is inaccurate.",

Although it was not in my first equation, I included it later below. You can't say I was wrong.<br /><br />Avery: But you didn't say that when you wrote the first equation.<br /><br />Me: But I said when I included the impulse.<br /><br />Avery: But you had a grammar error when you included the impulse (I used the word &quot;delta&quot; instead of &quot;change&quot; in &quot;the impulse results in a change of velocity&quot;) so no one understand it.<br /><br />Me: (WTF) At least I can explain my logic. My logic is not wrong. At least I deserve points for intermediate steps.<br /><br />Avery: No because your very first equation is wrong. Your following arguments must be wrong.<br /><br />Me: (WTF) But I considered impulse later on below???<br /><br />=========<br /><br />What the heck loop it is? Just because I use another method and wrote a grammar mistake I deserve 0 point?<br /><br />Even if I get an A-range tomorrow, I cannot accept his refusing to add a single point to this question (14 points, 7 questions in total, 95% final guys!)<br /><br />And you readers decide whether my above experience is useful or not.
