        "description": "This course is an introduction to an economics perspective of environmental problems, with attention to public policy solutions to pollution and climate change challenges. Part I will cover the ways in which markets fail to efficiently allocate resources in the presence of pollution along with the class of Pigouvian policies used to correct those failures. Part II will focus on the empirical techniques used by economists to assess the cost and benefits of environmental policies.",
