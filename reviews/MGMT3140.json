If you aren't, you should probably not take this course. I honestly didn't speak that much in this course. If you can speak up a lot, and the professor knows your name, you can get a high grade. Considering it was 25% for attendance (like actual participating in class, not just attending), I should have spoken more.",

You won't have much to do in the first two weeks, but as time goes, you have to prepare for the negotiation cases. The passages get longer and more complex, so you will need more time to understand the whole passage. You would also need time for how to strategically target the opponent in a negotiation. However, the overall workload isn't that much. Pure participation in the course is more important, and this can be done without that much preparation. There are some quizzes for some negotiation cases which ask for very easy concepts. (it's never stressful)",

It is the best time to apply what you have learned from the class, or to get really frustrated in the negotiation and be prepared to learn something new in the debrief session following the negotiation class. The negotiation techniques taught are somewhat common sense, but can come in handy when you are consciously using them against those who are not aware of how powerful these tools can be.",

The only take-home part is to prepare for the negotiation of the following week. A 2-question quiz will be administered to make sure you are well prepared - but that's nothing. You can hardly believe it is a 4-credit course with such a minimal workload.",

Some people said that the grading is bad, it’s true that the course doesn’t have a high transparency, but you cannot expect participation mark to have high transparency, it’s intangible. 15% attendance for the negotiation exercises and 25% for the participation, make sure to answer more questions, it’s important to leave a good impression and also makes you to focus more in the class.",

However, starting from like second week or third week, the passage is long and you need to read before the class. Remember to read the case thoroughly because this let you fully engaged and participate in the negotiation, you gonna learn and enjoy from it. There are quizzes with 2 MCs before the negotiation begins, just to test whether you have read the case or not, it’s not difficult but I remembered I got one mistake in the first quiz (marks were not disclosed but I just remembered). Hard work will pay off in this course, overall I paid great amount of effort in it so I am very satisfied with the grade.",

            "comment_content": "The course covers a wide range of negotiation concepts, which are all very useful and practical. I won’t go into too much detail, since I think it’s best to go into the course blind.",
            "comment_teaching": "Every week, during the first lesson we had a negotiation exercise, where we each have a secret role/objective, and then we negotiation with other students in the class. Then, during the second lesson, we see everyone’s results from the exercise and discuss, with the professor introducing the concepts that are relevant to the case. <br /><br />Prof. Nason is a very fun professor and his classes were quite interesting. He often gives anecdotes from his own life and was very laid back, which made the whole experience quite approachable.",
            "comment_grading": "Due to COVID, we had two term papers instead of exams. For the first one, we had to plan and execute a negotiation (could be anything) and write a paper analysing it using class concepts. For the second one, we had to analyze a negotiation of our own choice (in history or in a movie).<br /><br />Grading:<br />Personal Negotiation: 20%<br />Negotiation Case Analysis: 25%<br />Negotiation Guide: 5%<br />Research Participation: 5%<br />Participation &amp; Discussion: 25%<br />Attendance: 15% <br /><br />Me:<br />Personal Negotaiton Case: B+<br />Negotiation Case Analysis: A<br />Attendance, Research Participation, Negotiation Guide: Full<br />Participation &amp; Discussion: Unknown<br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />Although he didn’t release the grading criteria until after the personal negotiation was due (would’ve been helpful if he gave it before), he did tell us how he graded the papers:<br />C range - wrong/very little use of class concepts<br />B range - correct/good use of class concepts<br />A range - going beyond class concepts or analysing the class concepts in further depth (e.g. counterintuitive findings)<br /><br />As such, I think the grading was quite transparent and fair. For example, for my personal negotiation case, I didn’t use anything that went beyond the class concepts or analyze in that much depth, so a B+ is understandable. The case analysis was graded similarly, so I made sure to go beyond the class concepts for the second paper. Overall, I think he was quite generous with the grading, as I wasn’t expecting to get an A because my first paper was only a B+.<br /><br />In my opinion, even if it was bad grading (which I don’t really think it is), this course is an easy recommendation, since it’s both fun and useful. The topics and concepts you learn are quite relevant to any negotiation and it was easily the most fun course I’ve taken in a while.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload wasn’t that much besides the preparation for the negotiation exercises, which mostly just required us to read our role and case information (~7 pages). The reports have a word limit (1000 for the personal case and 2400 for the case analysis) and you have a couple of weeks to do each.<br /><br />One thing to note is that you should only register for this course if you are willing to participate in the negotiation exercises. Since these exercises are a major part of the course experience, not putting in the effort is both a waste of your own time, and it also ruins the experience for others.<br /><br />In one of the exercises, we had a team negotiation where we each had separate information, but there was one girl on our team that was muted with her camera off and barely responded to anything we asked. This ruined the experience (as it’s like talking to a brick wall), and we only learned that she had crucial information we didn’t have when the other team asked us about it. <br /><br />However, if you are willing to participate (which is quite easy since the cases are interesting and fun), it is definitely a worthwhile experience.",

It includes many different strategies and different techniques in order to gain the upper hand in business deals. It also teaches you to create scenarios that benefit both parties and can be used in all different aspects of life. I fundamentally enjoyed the content as a majority of it was non-theoretical and very practical. There are a lot of in class negotiations which i feel really highlighted the concepts. This course offers an opportunity to really interact with peers in class which is something that i really found lacking in HKUST.",
            "comment_teaching": "Mr. Nason is one of the aspects that makes this course as incredible as it is. He was always very helpful and used different mediums of teaching which is perfect for both visual, practical and theoretical learners alike. He is a very open teacher and is more than happy to help out with concepts that may not be clear. He is a great teacher and has really made this course incredible.",
            "comment_grading": "In terms of grading, this course was fairly easy for me. I really enjoyed the teaching style and the different negotiation methods taught which probably contributed to the A i received. As long as you understand the concepts and have had practice applying them (which you should have if you attend the classes) you should be completely fine in both the final and the midterm exam. The final exams focus more on situations and how to adapt the negotiation styles to them. It is important to attend classes as well because the in class negotiation results are recorded and will be leveraged into your final grade through some percentage.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload in this course was very low. After each class, you receive a scenario for the next class which you should read up on and study (however they are usually 1-2 pages long so it isnt much reading to get through). I had a lot of time to focus on other courses during the semester and found that the majority of the learning was in class.",
