        "description": "In this course we deep-dive into market design, that is, the application of economic theory to designing or improving various kinds of market mechanisms. In particular, we will focus on two kinds of market mechanisms: matching and auction. If time permits, we may also discuss the design of financial markets. We will learn some theory, and then we will also learn how to use the theory to analyze and design markets for practical use. This course will be taught in a seminar format. Prepare to actively participate in discussions.",
