            "comment_content": "The content covers the basic information about immunology and introduces many of the important discoveries and how they were achieved. Very interesting content, however, there is a lot of information that you need to learn/memorise. Attending the lecture is a must if you want to do well for the exams because the lecture slides are mainly diagrams and pictures that are difficult to understand without context.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is very knowledgable about the topic and can answer all questions. He is able to explain complicated concepts very well and can go slowly if people don't understand. Many of the concepts will be extremely difficult without his teaching and explaining.<br />The prof will also explain some important information that will come up during the exam and sometimes he also mentions which information and which slides you will need to know for the exam.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading was OK, because a lot of the concepts and content was difficult. I got lucky and managed to get a good grade mainly because I went to lectures and took notes.",

Understanding is also very important to answer questions in the exams (so make sure you attend the lectures!)<br />1 midterm and 1 final. The final exam is not cumulative but some knowledge from the first half will be needed.<br />There are also a few in-class open-note quizzes and he will usually mention it on the day. The quiz will be at the end of the class, but it is very easy to get full marks. Just make sure you are there in class.",
