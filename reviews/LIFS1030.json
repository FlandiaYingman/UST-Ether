            "comment_teaching": "For fellow exchange students who are not used to the HKUST system, this course is taught by 3 different professors: Prof Ice Ko, Prof Qian, Prof Cindy Lam.<br /><br />Prof Ice Ko[Ice is Ko(Cold)]<br />She taught the first half of the course content until the midterm test. On the first lesson and every subsequent lesson, she kept emphasizing about the importance of interaction between human and educator which is something that YouTube can never replace. Besides, she also kept insisting that the last 3-4 rows are left vacant and those sitting there should shift forward. As for the delivery of the course content, her PowerPoint slides are quite different (extra content) from the PDF files that we are given. If you want to get a good grade instead of just aiming for a pass as an exchange student, please take notes. I am really impressed with her command of English, her accent (sounds like Received Pronunciation) is super easy to follow. During lectures, she talked about environmental issues in a very biased way and she shouldn’t even mention her opinion and religious beliefs about them at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, she should be neutral and let students form their own opinions about those things. Finally, her classes have never ended on time. Thank your lucky stars if it ends 10 minutes after the lesson ending time on the schedule. <br /> <br />Mid-semester Test [Refer to Confession #Fys3162 on HKUST FYS Secrets 4.0]<br />It started 15 minutes late and the counting of exam scripts took another 15 minutes. The funniest thing is when there are at least 6 TAs (Postgraduate students) trying to count about 130+ exam scripts again and again with the aid of multiple calculators.<br /> <br />Prof Qian<br />His lectures were super boring, please have a good night of rest before the lecture or drink a caffeinated beverage. With regards to his English accent, it is much worst than Prof Ice Ko but he is still understandable overall. Another thing that I want to highlight is the fact that his lecture slides are referenced off from Wikipedia (/Facepalms/). If you expect an early lunch, you are in luck as he usually ends the lecture slightly earlier than the stipulated time.<br /> <br />Prof Cindy Lam<br />Her command of English pales in comparison to Prof Ice in terms of fluency. As for the course content, it should be manageable as the topics were covered in Geography classes before. Like Prof Qian, she also ends the lecture earlier than the stipulated time.<br /><br />新嚟嘅exchange students, 有三個professor教呢個course.<br /><br />Prof Ice Ko[Ice is Ko(Cold)]<br />頭一半嘅content呢係佢教直到midterm. 每一堂佢都會喺度講 interaction between 學生同埋老師係好重要 ,YouTube係絕對取代唔到嘅.<br />同埋佢好鍾意叫人哋呢唔好坐最後嗰第三第四排. 至於嗰個內容呢, 佢嗰個PowerPoint係唔同嘅, 係加咗料嘅版本. 如果你想攞靚grade嘅話,唔該抄下Notes. 佢D英文真係好好呀,好容易明白佢講嘅嘢. 不過有時佢會 用一啲好bias嘅方法講啲environmental嘅嘢, 佢係唔應該提到佢嘅諗法啦同埋宗教信仰. 佢應該係用一個好neutral嘅viewpoint 理解啲嘢囉, 等學生自己有佢哋自己嘅思想. 最後,佢啲堂呢係唔會早End囉. 如果佢嘅堂遲十分鐘end已經算好鬼好㗎喇.<br /><br />Mid-semester Test [Refer to Confession #Fys3162 on HKUST FYS Secrets 4.0]<br />遲咗15分鐘開始, 數捲又要多15分鐘,總共半個鐘 .最好笑係 六個TA用好幾部計數機計嚟計去都計唔到.<br /><br />Prof Qian<br />佢啲堂好悶, 前一晚早啲瞓或者飲杯奶茶或者咖啡. 佢啲英文呢就冇Prof Ice咁好啦,不過都聽得明嘅. 另一樣我想提到嘅嘢就係佢啲slides喺Wiki嗰度嚟㗎. 如果你想早d食午餐呢,咁你就有運行啦因為佢會早d落堂.<br /><br />Prof Cindy Lam<br />佢啲英文呢就冇阿Prof Ice咁流利. Course嘅content應該ok, 之前Geography應該學過. 佢啲堂都會早d完嘅 = 早d食午餐呢.",

It included content from lectures not within the exam scope, and makes you feel that there is no meaning for revising for the exam.<br /><br />Even so, Prof. Ice Ko is not willing to accept students' negative comments. According to her, the blame is on the students - we are expected to &quot;integrate the knowledge&quot; and &quot;fully understand the content&quot; in order to answer her obscure questions. The public chatroom is disabled after the midterm and students can be muted if they start to criticise the midterm exam.<br /><br />However, Dr. Cynthia Yau is a patient and nice teacher.",

But tbh don't even bother completing Cindy's slides because they're basically useless for the exam.<br />What I liked about Ice’s lecture is she gave quite a lot of case study, and made the lectures more comprehensible and generally easier to memorize.<br />Prof. Qian may not be the best at teaching, but I can see that he is a great professor with very deep knowledge of what he's teaching. If you concentrate on what he's saying, you might notice that he repeated the same thing over and over, and that's like a sign that it's going to appear on the exam.<br />I think Prof. Wang is the worst at teaching, but I would like to give applause on his very short slides, making my finals a little bit easier. I kinda hate him because he's the one who proposed to make short questions during the final exam. But then again, the purpose of enrolling yourself in a university is to study, so...<br />Cindy is a very nice person. I think she taught us in the most ideal pace out of the four. She doesn’t have anything particularly interesting about her lectures, but what’s wrong with being mediocre? :)",

Just skim through the slides and use your common sense to finish the exam because it's seriously easy.<br />The midterm is 50 MCs and they give you 50 mins.<br />The final is 20 MCs and 5 short questions (yeah, short questions but freakin long answers), duration 2 hours. For the short questions, it’s only about Prof. Wang’s lectures, something like cycles, and bullet points style questions. I made up some useless shit for the short questions, but when I checked my paper I got full marks! I guess as long as it made sense, they didn't care much about the detail. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯<br />For Ice's lecture, memorize even the tiny bit details on the pictures and diagrams because they actually appeared on the exam. I learned this the hard way, so don't let your midterm score suffer as mine did.

Quite easy for Science students to catch up. <br /><br />The video project requires students to form a group of 5, producing a 5-mins video about any topic in Environmental Science. There will be a workshop teaching the students how to use Adobe Premiere Pro. Students can borrow equipments from the library for video production (Camera, video recorder, etc.) after joining the workshop. The workshop is quite useful.

Her teaching is the most interesting part of the course. Make sure you don't use your mobile phone, take photos of her PowerPoint slides and sleep in the lesson. She will ask you questions even if you seat at the back. <br />Exam tips for her part: Attending all her lectures is important. Take notes on the PowerPoint slides which are not included in your handout. Exam questions would be set on topics being discussed &amp; additional information of the PowerPoint slides in the lesson. She's nice if you are a decent student.<br /><br />Dr. Cindy Lam: Her PowerPoint slides are too informative that she taught a bit rush. (She promised not to set exam questions on topics that she had no time to teach but finally she set one.)<br />Exam tips for her part: Attending lectures is useful, a small proportion of exam questions would be set on information given in the lecture. Don't miss the small tables and details in the PowerPoint slides. Her part is the most time-consuming when doing revision because there are so much information that you need to recite.

Hoverer, her PPT slides were not well-organised that you had to pay attention in the lecture, and try to create your own notes after reading her learning materials. She also forgot to reply to my email.......",

NEVER ONLY READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH!<br /><br />(Qian, Peiyuan)<br />Well to be fair, he has some good points to note if you brainstorm them intensively. He usually smiled, and produced words as if giving a speech all the time with extensive hand gestures. He appeared to be a great speaker visually and looked very confident of his teaching. It is easy to feel that he has a good personality, and from his qualifications, he should have great academic ability too. Also, the powerpoints have much content.<br /><br />Yet maybe it is a troll by the God, or because of whatever made-up excuses, he has unmatching, if not zero, teaching ability. <br /><br />I mean, the fact that he was smiling had a great 違和感 (aka a feeling of violating harmony) with most students who were desperately maintaining a polite face, giving up life with a poker face, or rebelling and yelling &quot;why am I here&quot; internally with a black face. He seemed to be indulged in his self-created zone of praise and acknowledgement and said firmly to himself, &quot;my people love me&quot;. (Slide note: he used &quot;people&quot; to address students all the time) Or, maybe he realized it, but he had no other choices but continuing squeezing a smile to ease the dull, uncomfortable and awkward atmosphere. After all, we should think emphatically too. However, who created this atmosphere from scratch?<br /><br />I mean, when he &quot;produced words&quot;, he was doing anything but passing knowledge. Sometimes, he was basically reading out slides as if university students, having needed to pass the not-so-basic language requirements, were basically illiterate at all. Even if you are, unfortunately, really illiterate, you have Google Translate. Given that your &quot;reading&quot; speed is probably 500% faster than his &quot;reading&quot; speed, it is literally, if you are literate, a complete waste of precious time. Sometimes, in fact, he would talk about new concepts (maybe not in ppt) straightly, just, which means, without any definition, concreteness, or explanation. It seems he assumed us illiterate people understood all specialist jargon. If you are to learn for curiosity, for appreciation of the nature, for a growth of brain and heart, you will probably be brutally disappointed. If you are to learn for grades, for requirement, or for flexing, then you are lucky - you will only be slightly disappointed. You only have to memorize everything, abandon your soul, and pretend that you understand anything, you will be fine. For me, I tried to think immediately or resorted to Google lastly once I found a concept unclear until I understood it. (and realizing once and once again Google deserves an A+ in Teaching). But as soon as I did that, our dearest professor was reading out another slide. So what is the point of attending &quot;lectures&quot;?????<br /><br />I mean, when he was giving out the speech, he was like a failing Ted Talk speaker wannabe. As if the above are not bad enough, his speech were characteristically inserted with frequent unwanted, redundant, and ridiculously lengthy break, attempting to murder your passion for this world. It was like 5 seconds every single time, 4 times every single minute. Imagine your life was like that and you had a lifespan of 90, then you LOST 30 years completely! To think emphatically again, maybe they were intended for digestion? Com'on, digest 1+1=2 in 5 seconds, and digest Riemann hypothesis in 5 seconds too! Plus, they were random, unpredictable, and scattered everywhere to 反高潮 (verb of anti-climax), as if there were any.<br /><br />I mean, his hand gestures, were indeed good and I have nothing more to add, except being wasted, like his talents.<br /><br />I mean, his appearing as a great speaker visually contradicts the very nature of &quot;speaker&quot; for which dictionary definition gives &quot;A person who speaks.&quot; (Oxford). He was like a master of table manners except that instead of savoring food, he was vomiting. He was like a rich guy living in a house of gold yet with an empty heart. He was like a spelling bee champion who could not compose a single sentence. Idk what the hell I am writing. In short, it is simply a waste. Yet, that &quot;Idk what the hell is going&quot; captures his lectures perfectly.<br /><br />I mean, confidence is good, but reflection upon oneself is equally important, given the countless thumbs-downs in the reviews above and below. In Chinese we have “人無恥則無敵” (If you are shameless, you are invincible). Though personally NOT agreeing with this statement (or I would give an A for his teaching), he was a living example. To be honest, did he know his popularity actually? Did he ever have a slight thought of trying to improve?<br /><br />*The ppt are, as expected, also extremely bad, but sorry that I don't have time to write completely currently.

Sad to say he and his TA ruined the lectures mostly because they both have the tendency to drift too far off the topic over the course of lectures, resulting in L7 almost not being mentioned at all. Significantly higher proportion of students who sleep or even absent in his lectures than of Cindy's. Skipped quite a few lectures on Tuesday before mid term. Be mentally prepared (in multiple aspects) if you were to attend his lectures IRL.<br /><br />The remaining lectures are taught by Cindy. Relatively more interactions and more comprehensible content. Not as demanding as Qian by all means.<br /><br />The issue of proliferating grammatical mistakes and rather confusing accents persists in both lecturers - can't blame them because I am slightly more considerate to those who have English as second language. Their accents are far more accessible to some other local students than me do.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is fair IM(A)O - when applying the common UST grading standard.<br /><br />Mid term literally kills as the MAX score reached is 70/80 for the entire 20x-student class - my high score in the mid term was purely a fluke and from my prior knowledge in meteorology. Drilled too much into minute details in quite a few questions. Why is it supposed for us to recall which year did somebody start measuring atmospheric CO2 content in Mauna Loa (Hawaii)? (answer: 1958)<br />Midterm mean: 54.0/80<br />S.D.: 7.67<br />My score: 65<br /><br />Due to special circumstances (everybody here knows what's that about), final exam is conducted online in an open-booked format. MCs (there were 34) become considerably trickier because of that. With two ~200-word-limit short questions within 1 hour. Cindy doesn't care about grammar and prefers point form in answers as mentioned.<br />Final exam mean: 31.89/50<br />S.D.: 7.61<br />Highest Score: 47<br />Mine: 41<br /><br />Overall grade: A<br />(I am able to get this grade only because of my long term memory - almost most content in this review [read: 20 days after final exam] are recalled without any help from lecture notes and online searches. Getting good grades in UST is always that difficult :sigh:)",

Students may need to plan ahead as it takes quite some days to finish (my group took 2 weeks to plan and make the video FYI).<br /><br />After submitting the video project, students need to comment on their group members regarding their performance on the project (by a number rating), and other groups' video (by text).

            "comment_content": "If you have taken IB Geography or even just IGCSE Geography, most of the content should be familiar and should be easy to score A range by just attending lectures. It is mostly common knowledge and is very relevant to the world. If you like learning about the environment and animals, you will enjoy this course :)<br /><br />Content was split into 8 parts (see attached file). However due to not enough time, part 8 was not taught.<br /> <br />Professor Ko's topics should be easy for non-geography people to digest. However, Professor Lam and Qian's topics may be a bit difficult and confusing to understand if it's your first time learning about that. Imao even for me, I was still confused about some of the content under Prof Lam's topics.",
            "comment_teaching": "From the 3 professors, Prof Ko had the best teaching. Although she can come off as a bit strict, she explains very clearly and has summary checkpoints after key concepts.<br /><br />Prof Lam is very kind and friendly. I think her teaching is ok, but not as clear as Prof Ko (or maybe it's just because Prof Lam's topics are more complicated).<br /><br />Prof Qian is also a nice guy. But since I already knew most of the things in his topics, I didn't really pay attention to his teaching style.",

Final = 80%<br />[57/70, mean: can't remember, high: 59/70]<br /><br />However, they said would also take into account attendance. Not sure how serious they were about this though. <br /><br />The final was all multiple choice question. If you attended all the lectures, you should be fine. I thought I did good in final, but somehow only got 57. Prof Ko doesn't allow answer checking, so don't know what I got wrong. <br /><br />Ended up with A+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was very light. Only had one assignment and a final. <br /><br />For the assignment, we had to write a 500 word essay about an environmental topic of your choice. For those who took IB, this is like the long question in Paper 1. If last time your teacher made you write practice essays for those questions, you could even recycle one of those essays but just tweak a bit here and there. I wrote up mine a few hours before the deadline.<br /><br />If you follow this basic structure, you should be fine:<br /><br />1. Intro<br />2. Main Body (follow the PEE method (point, evidence, *explain)<br />3. Conclusion + final thoughts<br /><br />*Most of the points for the essay will be given on the explain part where you are required to show critical thinking<br /><br />During the course, if you are struggling with certain concepts, maybe it'll be better to read those chapters in the textbook or watch some youtube videos. Then to study for final, just watch the recorded lecture.",

All you need to get a good grade is reciting all the words on the lecture notes!<br />To be frank, the content is quite boring, extremely the case study part. The reason for this is that you don't need to analyze the cases by yourselves. They have been analyzed for you and then you have more lecture notes to remember : )",

It is not necessary to go to the lectures since his lecture notes contains all the content in the exam.<br />Prof wang put many pictures without explanation in his powerpoint, but he usually failed to explain these pictures clearly in his lectures. Since the pictures will appear as short essay questions in the final exam, you'd better know about the pictures by searching on the Google.<br />Cindy LAM just taught the last two lectures. Like Ice ko, her lecture notes contain too much content for her to complete. Many unrelated or weird points will be asked in the final exam so you need to review the lecture notes carefully.<br />To sum up, none of the instructors teaches very well.

I went for a business essay and apparently they didnt like it lol <br /><br />The format of the exam changed this semester, in the past it was all MC but in the final exam, 50 marks were on 'short' questions (really?!) and 50 marks on MCQ. The short questions were quite tedious to answer to be honest as it requires you to recite chemical equations and describe the different cycles in details, I mean if you didn't study you're screwed because there's absolutely no leeway for water blowing. <br /><br />I scored B+ at the end with the two exams scoring above mean one SD&nbsp;&nbsp;and essay below mean and the grading was much better than I expected.",

Especially for LIFS 1030 in the summer semester, you have only around one month of time to produce it.",

Some professors really give us some mean questions about really small details in ppt that nobody paid their attention too. <br />MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO STUDY UNLESS YOU WANT A SHITTY GRADE<br />(concentrate on small details on the powerpoint slides)",

High is 59 if im not mistaken.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />I know someone that got 17 in the essay and 51 in the final. His final grade is A-. So I guess the grade cutoff for the A ranges are pretty close. <br /><br />Final exam format is 70MCQs in 60 mins. Open notes, but you need to know where to look. Just make sure to get enough sleep and eat a decent breakfast before the exam. Maybe eat eggs so your brain works okay.",
            "comment_workload": "No workload. One final and one 500 word essay. Basically any topic about the environment which is pretty ambiguous. I doubt the essay is read thoroughly due to the sheer amount of students in our class (500), so just make sure to pick an okay topic and use lots of pictures to give the impression that you are trying your best.<br /><br />Since it is a morning class, I always AFK and later on 5 days before exam I finish all lecvids through canvas. Not a recommended strategy but I must say its possible to be a complete moron and still earn a decent grade.",

From the other comments, she prohibits students from using the phones and take photos from her slides. Note that each topic may last for 2-3 lectures. Exam questions may contain past paper questions and whatever she mentions during all the lecture.<br /><br />After Midterm:<br />I only went to his lecture once. The reason is that I cannot really understand what he is trying to explain, and his English is far off Dr. Ko's. I myself read the textbook about 1 week before the exam (so that I don't have to memorize each and every detail in the lecture notes, though his lecture notes are pretty short (about 20 slides).) But I guess it didn't work really well for me in the finals.<br /><br />P.S.: Some people mention that past paper is critical. I somewhat agree to this statement. The past paper that people mean is actually available in peter gao's website (under course BISC003).",
