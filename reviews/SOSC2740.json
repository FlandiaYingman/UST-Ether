We shall examine how gender organizes everything from our sense of personal identity to our daily face-to-face interactions, and how gender is embedded in institutions such as the family, labor market, media, and the state. The aim is to introduce students to a sociological perspective of thinking about gender.",

            "comment_content": "Although the course name is &quot;Gender and Society&quot;, the courses spends a great deal of time in raising examples of &quot;gender stereotypes&quot;. He spent a lot of time playing videos from YouTube, which primarily outlines the &quot;inequality&quot; between male and female. He did not complement the videos with sociological theories and he just opens the floor for vague class discussion.<br /><br />I am expecting some more sociological perspectives but they only take up very small portion of the course.<br /><br />This course is more like 1000-level. As a SBM student, I find it so similar to Business Ethics classes, in terms of quality, delivery, depth and intellectuality.",
            "comment_teaching": "Unrewarding.<br /><br />I think a previous SOSC1662 review on Grove's teaching perfectly describes my conclusion to him. That review attracts &gt;20 &quot;helpful&quot; clicks which is indeed very rare on UST SPACE. Other reviews with similar comments can also be found from Grove's SOSC1850 reviews.<br /><br />For most of the time, the concepts are spoon-fed to students and we are required to remember what he said and to recall them during examinations.",
            "comment_grading": "Aligning with other reviewers on UST SPACE, Groves' courses are usually poor in grade.<br /><br />It's totally right.<br /><br />The exams in this course are poorly designed. Each constitutes only 30 MCQ (--&gt; requiring to recall what he said and agreed) and very few fill-in the blank questions (--&gt; requiring to recall what he said and agreed).<br /><br />In exam, we were asked &quot;what is meant by sticky rice in gay community?&quot;, &quot;which country / region has the highest % of female inmates?&quot;, and &quot;why when A (married to B) is male, A and B's baby call B as daddy&quot; ......<br /><br />Most of the students get high marks easily, but it fails to distinguish which students are more sociologically able and who aren't.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For me, I fell into C-range in this course, but I have received far better grades from other sociology courses in HKUST. I guess that can already tell why you shouldn't take this course.",

And be prepared for the quiz 2 as 23 subchapters are covered in total.<br /><br />Assignment is a group project, with a group of 4-5 people (good teamates matters, otherwise you willl suffer). The topic of the project is: Covid 19 Gendered Media Exercise. You have to write a report with your groupmates (no specific word count but 5-10 pages of A4 are suggested). You may have to do presentation in the class.<br /><br />The main workload is only from the group project. If you want to obtain a good grade, better attend all the classes as the important points are only available from professors (the key points to answers questions in the exam) and you have to get the particiaption marks by answering questions (but I never did). <br /><br />Overall, not much homework but it do requires a lot to time to prepare for the classes.",

Groves has no standard in granting credits, sometimes he could grant someone 5% extra participation credits simply because she made a 3-min promotion about her club's event (related to sociology) during class. Even someone contributed to class discussions every lecture, Groves still couldn't manage to recognize those faces, and end up giving them little or even no participation points. <br /><br />If you are an introvert, think twice before you enrolled in any Groves' course as you will definitely get no extra credit from Groves for being &quot;quiet&quot;, and then your grade is over.

Gender and Biology 2. Gender and Everyday Life&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Gender at Work and in the Home&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Gender and Intimate Relationships and 5.
