I have 2 groupmates, one got C, and another unknown. <br />I could not judge if our instructor is good or not, as one of my groupmates (the unknown grade) freeride us for both presentations, so I worked very hard in order not to hinder my grades for too much. If I have a better groupmate, I think I could get A range.

It is easy to excel in the writing task with a previous solid ground of English writing. However, the later half of the course is really amazing. I really like the part of business presentation. Although content of business presentation is not the focus, it is really good the class does cover the skill to give a good business presentation. Skills about how to show confidence are discussed, eg gesture, posture, team transition and eye contact. Although these are somehow simple for a professional, they can lead you to the way to become a successful presenter on the stage. But the coverage is really not that much. Easy to pick up the skills with hard work.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ivy is really a good teacher, despite the rumor she is a killer in term of grade. In her class, she is always encouraging and praises students. She also shares how to write a business writing well. And the best of her teaching should be in business presentation. She demonstrates well about how to give a persuasive presentation taking advantage of gestures, postures and eye contact, and giving greatly constructive feedbacks to students' performance. For the purpose of improving the use of English in business environment, Ivy is the choice. By the way, as I get her resume from the Internet, I surprisingly know she was a law student in HKU before and studied about English in CityU for her master degree. No wonder she demands much for students' performance.",
            "comment_grading": "Ivy is moderate in grading students' assignments. In my class, most of the students get satisfactorys, equivalent as a 4 in LANG1002 and 1003. But after all I think the results do reflect their English proficiency. Personally I get one competent and two very goods, which are equivalent as a 5 and 6, in the accounting internal memorandum, accounting for 35% of the total course grade, and two 5s in the first management presentation, 10% of the course grade, and two 5s and two 6s in the second presentation with a share of 40% of the course grade. I think the most important thing to get a good grade in this course is to excel in the writing task and the second presentation task. The first presentation task does not matter a lot, only a difference of a sub-grade. Finally, I get an A- from Ivy, although I don't know how the grades are distributed. Some people claim it is the instructor who makes the sole decision for grade distribution. However, some others claim instructors are responsible for giving grades in the tasks, and the total course grades would be given by the co-coordinator. I really don't know much, but I am satisfied with the A- in LABU2051.<br />By the way, I personally think trusting what people claim in HKGOLDEN is a great disaster. There is a famous saying from HKGOLDEN, don't get serious for people surfing at HKGOLDEN, which seems true.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is moderate in Ivy's class. One accounting internal memorandum and two management presentations to be graded. However, to complete these assignments well, a number of hours have to be spent on preparation, drafting the memorandum, sending emails to ask Ivy, meeting groupmates and rehearsing. But most importantly, it seems hard work is not always associated with good grade in Ivy's class because a good English is really the prerequisite to good feedbacks in the tasks.",
