The professor also prepares two notes on antenna theory, modeling the radiation of a linear antenna and antenna array.<br />Chapter 12 is the relativistic theory of electrodynamics where many puzzles in the previous chapters become clear.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Foreman is a great teacher. He almost never skips any steps in derivations in both notes and lectures. His notes are super clear. Any seemingly complicated topics becomes easy to understand either mathematically or intuitively. He encourages students to ask any kinds of question in class — “there are no stupid questions” — and he always tries to answer as detailed as possible and has to make sure we all understand it.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading, I think, is fine for such a small class of 20 students.<br /><br />There are two grading schemes:<br />20% homework, 35% midterm, 45% final<br />20%homework, 20% midterm, 60%final<br />(Both with 3% bonus for asking questions in class)<br />Taking the higher one as your final grade.<br /><br />The questions in the exams, except the first question is from the text book, are all designed by our professor. They are all very good questions which test your analytical skills with some usual theoretical models, but not quite easy.<br /><br />One interesting feature of the grades in both midterm and final is that the first sd above mean is almost high.",

To finish one homework, you might need quite a few hours. In order to prepare for the exams, it would be safe if you go through some essential exercises on the textbook and work them out on your own (of course not to mention rederiving the formulas given in the notes).
