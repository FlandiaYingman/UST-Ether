Spinner &amp; UserPreference<br />6. Intent<br />7. Google Service<br />8. Multimedia<br />9. Advanced Topics (SQLite, notification, etc.)<br /><br />Basic Android development stuff. Although I have learnt Flutter to develop app in my internship but I still found them quite useful and interesting as it is a different aspect.<br /><br />The development platform is Android Studio, with base language Java. If you take COMP3021 you will have very large advantage (Sarcastically, Charles Zhang's COMP3021 fuxked me last year but it helps me now. If you want to know more about this visit COMP3021 comment page)<br /><br />However, even though you haven't take COMP3021, the course content is still quite simple. It contains very less theory. Most of the things are straightforward, high-level and practical. The code is not hard to comprehend as well. You will not find any problem even for self-studying. Due to the high workload from FYP and other courses, I don't have much spare time to have the 3 hours lecture weekly, but I still managed to handle the course content.<br /><br />I would say, the difficulty of this 4000 level COMP course is somehow equivalent to 3000, or even 2000 level COMP course only. A student who just finished COMP1022P or COMP2012 is able to pass this course as well (In reality you generally can't because of the prerequisite, although I don't see any necessity to have the knowledge of 2611 and 3511 for handling this course)",
            "comment_teaching": "New lecturer since Prof. Muppala retires recently.<br /><br />A very nice guy, aside from grading (describe later). He is a local lecturer so his does not have much accent. His voice is quite soft but the pace is fine. However, in the lecture, he just go through the concept and the demo code in the lecture notes once while they are quite self-explanatory. As<br />a result, the overall pace of the lecture is quite slow. Therefore, it is not really necessary to go to the lecture. <br /><br />Ah yes, for this semester, the lecture time is FRIDAY NIGHT 7PM - 10PM. I can only say, who will be that willing to have a lecture on Happy Friday night till 10PM? Fortunately, the prof is kind, he provides Zoom real-time lecture as well as recording so you can just have real-time lecture at home or watch the recording at an time you want. <br /><br />He is really kind, he gives out many time in the lecture for the student to run the code and he always gives time for break as the lecture time is 3 hours. He also extends the deadline of all the project components for one week because students request it. I praise his entire effort in this course...<br /><br />aside from grading.",
            "comment_grading": "1. Project (50%)<br />-&gt; 1.1 Initial app Idea (10%)<br />-&gt; 1.2 Project proposal (15%)<br />-&gt; 1.3 Final product &amp; presentation (25%)<br />2. Final Examination (50%)<br /><br />Final grade: B+<br /><br />Everything in this course is fine, but when it comes to grading, it falls apart. Probably it is not hard to get decent grade in this course and I get decent grade as well, but the experience just annoyed me anyway.<br /><br />For this semester, the grading scheme add one more thing: A final exam. The prof claimed that this is used to make the distribution become more even. Unfortunately, this the beginning of a nightmare. It completely backfires.<br /><br />Firstly, let me ask you, if there is a COMP course that contains a project and an extremely easy, low fault tolerance exam, which COMP course will you come up?<br /><br />COMP3111 right?<br /><br />Yes, the grading style of this course is very similar to COMP3111. Why? Because the exam is so fucking easy. MC questions ask straightforward concept question (Sth like what is the use of a specific component or if you want to print a string on console then which function should you use). Coding questions only ask us to implement trivial features as well. The exam time limit is 3 hours, but people start leaving 1 hour after the exam starts.<br /><br />What is worse than 3111 is that, in 3111, at least you need to recite the exercise or &quot;Hints&quot; that Kenneth gives you because the exam is close-book right? However, for this course, the exam allows you A CHEATSHEET. That means, after you put everything from the lecture notes into the cheatsheet, the MC question can be directly referenced from the cheatsheet. You can directly copy the function into the coding question as well. That further narrows the performance difference between students. I can imagine that even 1 MC will already cost you a subgrade.<br /><br />One powerful evidence is that, I got B+ eventually. That sounds not really bad right? But my project partner gets an A+. I mean like, WTFFFFFFFF??????????????<br /><br />This means either, we have different score for project, which is less likely as the prof does not know the division of labor; or I screw up the final exam. However, although I don't have much self-satisfaction, I would say I know over 85% of the question in the exam (Most of the people should have at least percentage as well). At least I didn't struggle a lot and I am able to do it smoothly. I just can't understand how large is the score difference between us. If this exam had not existed like in the past, probably I would have gotten A range.<br /><br />Another thing which is even more annoying than 3111 is that, this course's grading is non-transparent as fuxk. There is nothing call transparency in this course. It is just a solid concrete wall which blocks everything.<br /><br />At least Kenneth will post all the score and statistics for you right? But this prof did not even publish any numerical score or statistics or project feedback for us. Our score is like being blocked by a 國防布 (For non-Chinese speaker just treat this as solid wall which blocks everything). I cannot see anything about my performance or the overall performance (完全沒有畫面.jpg). I can't even know how bad I have done in the exam. The only thing I know is that, I get a B+, and me and my teammates differs from a LETTER GRADE.<br /><br />I don't know who propose the idea of having an exam on this course. It is either the prof himself or he is forced to do that by CSE department, but I would say anyway: This exam is stupid. <br /><br />Probably this prof is new to this university and he doesn't know the hidden rule of this school: &quot;An easy exam out of generosity will backfire on the student&quot; because it will become a carefulness testing with low fault tolerance anyway.<br /><br />Although I genuinely think the prof does not deliberately do all these things, anyway, stop making any &quot;COMP3111 style&quot; exam and grading (Easy content, low fault tolerance) in the future. You can either test more difficult things to differentiate ability or just wiped the exam out. <br /><br />The prof claims that the exam can make the performance distribution more even, NO, IT'S NOT. Everyone just score high with small score differences. This type of exam does not differentiate the ability of students. It only differentiate how careful students are. Is that really the thing that you want to differentiate? What is the point?<br /><br />Sorry for being emotional and typing a bunch of junk in this part, but I am quite disappointed. I think this is the closest chance that I can get an A range in COMP course (alongside 3111, which I get B+ as well) but for both times I get fuxked by a stupid carefulness testing exam. Well, at least I get my first and last&nbsp;&nbsp;A+ from CORE1501 and FYP (Thank you Desmond...), as well as my first and last dean list in this school, which comforts me a lot @@",
            "comment_workload": "1. Group project<br />Make an app in Android Studio. You must use this (The base language taught is Java, but I don't know whether Kotlin is ok). You can't use other things like Flutter.<br /><br />Three phases:<br /><br />1.1 Initial application idea<br />Write short report to draft the design of your app.<br /><br />1.2 Project proposal<br />Write a proposal to introduce the design structure of your app<br /><br />1.3 Final product<br />Final implementation of the project, which includes three parts: Source code, video presentation, final report.<br /><br />The workload of the project depends on the complexity of your project. My group used two days to finish app idea and proposal respectively. We used around two weeks to finish the final product part (We just start this part after the FYP presentation).

Final exam<br />Most of the thing have been mentioned in &quot;GRADING&quot;. Straightforward &quot;COMP3111 style&quot; exam, stupid as fuxk.

Mildly useful... I guess.",
            "comment_teaching": "Every lecture he just goes over the functions and how to drag and drop UI components, if you have taken COMP3021, none of this is new and after going to 1 lecture you basically get the idea for every lecture. Attendance is low.<br /><br />Furthermore the class is held on FRIDAY NIGHT, so there's even less reason to go.<br /><br />There are labs, but the only one I attended went over the exact same things the lecture did, so I don't think there's a point.",
            "comment_grading": "This course prior did not have a final exam, however it seems the school saw fit to add a 50% Final Exam to this class this semester, alongside with the project.<br /><br />App Idea (10%): Think of an app with your groupmates (2-3 people per group, you can also do it solo), write a short post on CANVAS explaining it.<br /><br />Project Proposal (15%): Similar to the app idea, but to explain in it a proposal, that also goes over the planned technical implementation of things.<br /><br />Course Project (Including Presentation) (25%): After finishing the project, write a report (reusing the project proposal mostly) about the implementation and results, and to make a video explaining the app that you have built.<br /><br />Examination (50%): COMP1021 style exam. Since the contents covered in the lecture are so limited, you can write the entire course on the 1 page cheat sheet provided. In the exam, there are 20 MCQs, 3 short questions and 1 final essay. For the MCQ and short questions, if you have prepared the cheat sheet well you can answer them easily. And for the &quot;essay&quot;, you have to write stuff about &quot;What are the advantages of Android development for businesses&quot; or &quot;How to develop a secure Android app&quot;, since it's only 250 words at most, you can just write whatever. (Average: will be very high, will update later)<br /><br />Letter grade released without any details, very opaque.",
            "comment_workload": "Like most group project, it is directly related to how your group is. Since developing on Android isn't extremely difficult, and guides are publicly available, if you have good groupmates you can implement the app in a couple of days. (My group finished in app in about 3 days.)<br /><br />As for the final, again, just copy everything from the lecture notes down on the cheatsheet, and you will be good to go.",
