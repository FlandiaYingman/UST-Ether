        "description": "In the era of \"Big Data\", organizations need a new infrastructure/platform to manage the storage and processing of large volume of data. This course introduces the emerging technological paradigm of big data management, as well as some common approaches that are used to gain insights from big data for business decision-making. In particular, it covers a range of big data technologies, including HDFS, MapReduce, Spark, Hive, Pig, etc., that allow for performing data-intensive analysis.",

            "comment_content": "The course covers the basic ideas and techniques in Big Data.<br />(Copied from syllabus)<br />• Understand MapReduce as a computation model and an execution framework<br />• Work with following tools in the big data application stack:<br />o Hadoop<br />o YARN<br />o Hive<br />o Pig<br />o Spark<br />o and perhaps others...<br />• Realize how different tools in the Hadoop stack fit in the big picture of big data analytics<br />• Design distributed machine learning algorithms<br />• Use cloud computing services (Amazon Web Services) to build your clusters and run large-scale data processing applications",
            "comment_teaching": "Perhaps this is a VERY NEW course, even Jia Jia himself also feel confused sometimes in teaching. He tried his best to explain the concepts to us, but I guess I just could not learn the knowledge well.<br /><br />P.S. Jia Jia and TA had been repeating in the add/drop period that there is risk in taking this NEW course, and telling us to drop the course if we could not take uncertainty. So this is also my advice to all of you: if you can't accept poor grade or uncertainty in courses, give up this course. (Or you can just sit in the course without enrolment cuz the course doesn't take attendance)",
            "comment_grading": "Final grade: B<br /><br />Lab Participation:10%<br />Easy part, just attend every lab and submit lab assignment (dun worry if it is correct or not, TA just want to make sure that you did attend the lab)<br />Also, TA suggested that sometimes the lab assignment may require more time to finish (a.k.a overrun), so if you consider taking this course, leave some time slots after the lab session.<br /><br />Homework (4): 40%<br />Originally there were 4 assignments, but Jia Jia fell behind the schedule and could not finish teaching all topics. So there were just 3 assignments.<br />It consists of MC and short questions. I spent long time in finishing them cuz I was not sure whether I answered questions correctly. But in the end I got full marks for all homework.<br /><br />Midterm quiz: 20%<br />It was a nightmare to me. Although we were allowed to bring a 2-sided cheat sheet, it did not help me much in the exam, except MC part which asked some facts. The short Q part was a hell to me. It asked the application of the concepts, but the only example we have is from the assignment (This is the reason why I provided suggestions of including more examples of application in the lecture in SFQ)<br />Fun fact is, some one got full marks :)<br /><br />Final project: 30% (1/3 of which is determined by peer evaluation)<br />4 - 6 people in a group, choose either (1) Online Product Recommendation or (2) PageRank for Recommendation systems (movie)<br />The detail of the project was announced at early Nov, and seriously, the only time you can finish it is after the end of semester (deadline was 22 Dec, 2017) and my group finish it within one week before the deadline.<br />This project is the reason why the course adds the prerequisite of ISOM3230 (i.e. some programming knowledge) in Spring 2018, because it requires you to submit the code.",
            "comment_workload": "If you just take a look of the syllabus, you would think the workload is okay. But considering such a topic with fast changing&nbsp;&nbsp;techniques, the workload can be huge.<br /><br />I took ISOM3360 this semester (Spring 2018) and knew that Prof. Yi Yang is going to teach this course in the next academic year.(not sure if it is Fall/ Spring, or both) Maybe a new prof can bring a different approach in teaching this course :)",
