            "comment_content": "There is no pre-defined syllabus, but rather the lecturer attempts to adapt the teaching to the background of the students. The contents of the class has consisted of mainly: discussion of ChatGPT, anagram/bigram models, inductive bias, learning vs. performance components of ML, search, Hidden Markov Models, etc.",
            "comment_teaching": "The class is very much an interactive and discussion-based class. If you are an engaged student that likes to ask questions and think out loud, you make like this course. If you are student who wants to just listen and take notes, I don't recommend this course. For several lectures, the professor simply never came, and the TA was forced to hold a lecture.",
            "comment_grading": "You are graded on your in-class participation (not exactly attendance), forum participation, mid-term exam as well as a final project. I do not know the grading ratios unfortunately.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is relatively light since most of the term since the lecturer does not assign much homework, however he will occasionally assign some task to think about and hand-in. The final project may take a lot of time, or may take little time, depending on the difficulty of your project. The lecturer promotes choosing something different and conduct new research, however this did not seem compulsory.",
