The prof tends to elaborate the concepts in more mathematical ways, so concepts related to statistics are quite essential to understand what he is talking about.<br /><br />The prof writes a lot during class, which is important and will appear in exams. So, better attend the classes. Also the tutorial, I found that super useful and help to understand everything better, and in a more practical way. Some sample questions and tips for the homework will be covered in tutorials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Allen Wu is friendly and willing to solve any question you have.",
