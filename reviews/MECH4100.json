        "description": "This course takes an experiential approach to aerospace engineering through (i) a series of seminars and workshops delivered by faculty and industry professionals, (ii) student-initiated tutorials on aerospace-related topics, and (iii) participation in an international aerospace competition. As well as giving students the opportunity to apply theoretical classroom knowledge to real-world engineering problems, this course will nurture skills in technical communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, and project management. This course will initially be led by faculty and then self-directed by students with faculty retreating as coaches. Students should seek approval from the course instructor prior to enrolling.",
