            "comment_content": "I like the content very much, since I like financial maths.<br /><br />On or before midterm exam:<br />1. Term structures, spot rates, spot price<br />2. Bond Valuation, in 4511, Redemption value = Face Value, clean and dirty price<br />3. Yield rate, annual effective/ nominal, compounded continuously etc<br />4. Interest rate valuation and bond valuation, modified duration, convexity<br />5. Floating Rate Bond, Forward rate, FRA and currency forwards.<br />6. Interest rate swap<br /><br />After Midterm Exam:<br />1. Currency Swap, Foreign Currency Swap<br />2. Options, European and American( just an introduction), call and put, bond call and put option, Put Call Parity and Convexity Property<br />3. More advanced on options: Callable Bond, Puttable Bond, Caplet, Floorlet, Cap, Floor and Swaption<br />4. Valuation on European Options: Binomial Tree Models, Risk Neutral Probability, Arrow Security...<br /><br />As I also study FINA 3203, I will do a comparison. <br /><br />Similar: <br />1. Similar syllabus, spot price, forward contracts, FRA, swaps and options and binomial tree model, Arrow Security (also called Binary Options in FINA 3203)<br />2. Test your brain, e.g. construct arbitrage opportunity, hedge risk<br /><br />Differences:<br />1. MATH 4511 teaches caplet, floorlet and swaption while FINA 3203 does not; FINA 3203 teaches futures, American Option (more details), Black Scholes Merton Model, Exotic Options and Credit Spread and Default Probability; I think those things will be covered in MATH 4514.<br />2. FINA 3203 always assumes interest rate compounded continuously while MATH 4511 does not.<br />3. FINA 3203 tests more on your Economics knowledge than Math computation, while MATH 4511 tests you more on your brain, or tricks to solve the problems, both courses are very good.<br /><br />Conclusion: I like both courses, if you want to work on this field in future, you should not miss these two courses. Reminder, Math students should take MATH 4514 instead of FINA 3203/",

There are 4 computational questions in the midterm (with 1 harder problem), with 75 minutes allowed.<br />* The problems are closely related to lecture notes, assignment (especially bonus problem) and problem set. Thus, pay more attention and try to get enough exercise before the exam.<br /><br />4. Final exam... speed contest! 9 problems, all standard ones, and is basically the same as the midterm.

If you feel confused about the concepts, just schedule a meeting with him and clarify your doubts. <br /><br />I agree that sometimes his lecture notes may jump too fast to the conclusion and students may feel confused. However, it's not a big problem as long as you CLARIFY YOUR DOUBTS with him.<br /><br />He's an investor in the financial markets as well so he touches on some market events (e.g. FED FOMC, rate hikes, US stock market moves) during classes, too, to give students some color on how macroeconomic policy changes impact the fixed income products + respective hedging strategies.<br /><br />I think he's underrated... Lol. Perhaps I have a different learning mindset from the others...",

Many students scored horribly low so Prof. Wu adjusted the grading policy otherwise there would be too many F-grade students.<br /><br />Many students (like 75%) skipped his classes &amp; tutorials. Only around 20 ppl showed up in his lectures.<br /><br />I genuinely find fixed-income derivatives (or global markets, generally) interesting so I attended almost every class &amp; tutorial sessions (except those clashing with my superday interviews).<br /><br />Some exam questions are designed to differentiate A-range students from others with concepts that have been stressed repeatedly in class.<br /><br /><br />For me:<br />hw: nearly full marks<br />midterm: 20/20 (high 20/20, low 4/20, mean 13.2)<br />final: 38/50 (high 44/50, low 3/50, mean 19.58)<br /><br />final grade: A+<br /><br />Not majoring in MATH or MAEC but the course grade was quite good.",

The materials for the term structure of interest rates is just a more detail version in those two courses. In this course, don't expect that the interest is fixed (as this is a fixed income course: By prof.) The interest rate curves are determined by market information (T-Bonds, Zero-Coupon Bonds, Par Bonds and LIBOR).<br /><br />The second half is much harder than the first part. it takes some time to understand the concepts if you are a MATH student.<br /><br />Basic Programming knowledge will be expected, Professor will use MatLab to demonstrate some concepts in the second half of this course.<br /><br />This course is not Math heavy, you just need to have some basic knowledge in probability (CLT, Binomial and Normal Distributions)&nbsp;&nbsp;and partial derivatives to understand the derivation of the formulae, others are just simply algebras (nothing about matrix operations). Stochastic Calculus is not needed for this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Better than expected<br />Although the professor's teaching is a bit unclear sometimes, and there are quite some typos in the Lecture Notes (most of them should be fixed after this semester), I can see that he is trying his best to teach us.<br /><br />Extraordinary nice accent for a mainlnd professor.<br /><br />Office hours may be useful if you need some clarification on some conceptual things. It is also good to chat with Prof. Wu if you want to learn more about this field, he is willing to tell you more about the topics and share some of his experience with you. (You can chat with him with Cantonese)",
