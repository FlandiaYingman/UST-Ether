        "description": "This course adopts an introductory and interdisciplinary approach to help students appreciate the theory, history and practice of the art of puppetry. Students will develop a script, design and build shadow puppets, choreograph and rehearse a show, produce a sound track, design lighting and perform the show. Students will learn about basic puppet types, such as the difference between a puppet and a marionette. We will examine puppets from around the world and how technological innovations, especially lighting, sound, video and special effects, are changing puppetry. Students will see examples of actual puppets before they design and make their own.",

The rest of the classes are totally useless, we just did our own paper cutting work. Don't expect to learn anything, you already know everything from your commonsense. The final showing is a shadow puppet performance with the script of Alice in Wonderland(the teacher decided the script). It was so boring.",
