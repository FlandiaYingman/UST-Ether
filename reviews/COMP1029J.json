        "description": "This course introduces the Java programming language. It is intended for students who already have some experience in computer programming but wish to learn how to apply those programming skills to the Java language. The course covers basic programming topics such as variables, control statements, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts. Students explore these by self-learning of course materials together with guided programming exercises. Students without the prerequisites but possess relevant programming knowledge may seek instructor's approval for enrolling in the course. Graded P or F.",
