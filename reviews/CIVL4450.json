With the latest trend to cope with climate change, the content if self is quite practical and also up-to date. Students are expected to get some insights to field of environmental sustainability. <br /><br />As a CIVL-4000 level course, the content is a bit little as the content is less engineering orientated but more on the managing aspect. All the calculations are from module 2, and they should be easy to handle for civil students. They are just unit conversions.<br /><br />For CIEV students, one of the electives should be chosen from this course or the other two taught by Prof. Lo( CIVL5450 and CIVL5460) .
