        "description": "This course examines financial intermediaries with a particular emphasis on banks. It introduces students to the nature, purpose, and management of these institutions. The course also brings together the upstream issues in risk measurement and the regulative environment surrounding banks. By the end of this course, students will be able to understand the role of banks in the economy and the effects of frictions such as information asymmetry and agency costs on bank behavior. The course will start with the review of basic game theory.",

It does not require much mathematical background. <br /><br />Ch1 Introduction<br />Ch2 Game Theory<br />Ch3 Maturity Transformation<br />Ch4 Relationship Banking, Credit Rationing, Screening, and Delegated Monitoring<br />Ch5 Bank Regulation<br />Ch6 Bank Competition<br />Ch7 Bank Networds<br />Ch8 Financial Crisis<br /><br />Basically, most of the topics except Bank Regulation are related to calculations. Midterm tests up to chapter 4 credit rationing. The course contents involve many assumptions but you still can learn the mechanisms of the commercial banks such as the InterBank market, how bank set interest rate.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor's teaching is great. The lecture notes are mostly problems with lots of space which you need to copy the answer in class.

Make sure you have copied the correct answer so that you can understand the problem in exam.",

He makes the point of each question to around only 1-2 point. When the final answer is wrong, you get no mark. This makes the mark in midterm and final exams so low even though the content is easy.",

You only need to repeatedly do the questions in the lecture notes and in the homework. You do not need to buy the textbook as it is useless. All the content is designed by Prof. and there is no extra exercise for you to practice the calculations problem.",
