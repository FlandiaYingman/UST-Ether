Just enjoy and have fun in the class! <br /><br />She also has some group activities, such as experiments. She once did an experiment of counting the number of M&amp;M in a big jar.

Just don't miss more than 6 lessons then your attendance score will be full. <br /><br />Exam: You can bring an A4 size, a double-paged cheat sheet to the exam. Basically, you can just put everything in the cheat sheet and go to the exam directly if you do not have time to study.<br /><br />Decision Analysis Assignment: I think this is the only workload of the course. It is quite difficult to think of a topic that is real and relevant to yourself. Consult Carmen to finish the assignment if you want to guarantee a good score. 1000 words limit.<br /><br />Project: NO REPORT, you just need to do a 15 minutes presentation. Read an experiment and then stated the experiment result, procedures, with some business implications and suggestions on an organizational issue in your presentation.",
