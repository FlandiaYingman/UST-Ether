            "comment_content": "Like many other courses in HKUST, this course crams the 3-year chemistry HKDSE syllabus in only 3 months, which is entirely challenging to understand all of them (unless you are the elite one).<br /><br />There are 6 chapters for this course:<br /><br />Chapter 1: What is everything made of? (J)<br />Chapter 2: Air (E)<br />Chapter 3: The air and our environment (E)<br />Chapter 4: The metals in our daily life (E)<br />Chapter 5: Metals in the industry (J)<br />Chapter 6: Fire and fuels (J)<br /><br />(J: taught by Professor CHAN, Kwan Kit Jason;<br /> E: taught by Professor TSANG, Ming Wai Emily)<br /><br />***(Usually in the previous semesters, only Professor CHAN would teach all chapters but he was really busy in this semester, so part of the chapters were taught by Professor TSANG)<br /><br />Before starting each chapter, there are some recommended reading lists that you are optional to read them (but I never read any of them since I was too busy in other courses) to let you have some basic overview of the coming chapter you are going to learn.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter, there will be an exercise worksheet for you to do (which is optional to do). But I still recommend you to do that if you want to get good result in the quizzes and the final exam.<br /><br />In this course, you need to do a project (either an individual written study report, a group experimental study project or a group video clip study project).<br /><br />There are two graded quizzes and a final exam.<br /><br />You can see the attachments for more information.",
            "comment_teaching": "Overall speaking, both professors are good to teach this course.<br /><br />For Professor CHAN, Kwan Kit Jason, he is also called Dr Fire if you know he has shown up in a local TVB television programme called Sidewalk Scientist many times. His teaching is better than Professor Emily Tsang since he has taught CHEM1004 for 6 years if I remember it right. His teaching is interesting as he almost did at least one experiment in each lecture. He is more fluent in conducting the materials to us. I have asked him through emails and he answer all my questions clearly within a day.<br /><br />For Professor TSANG, Ming Wai Emily, she is not as good as Dr Fire as her teaching was more slower in pace. She sometimes has difficulties in explaining the things to us. So, after the class, I have to read through the notes for multiple times before barely understand what she has said in class.",
            "comment_grading": "I would say it is satisfactory.<br /><br />I have heard from my classmates (and also checked&nbsp;&nbsp;some reviews in UST.SPACE) that you will get B- to C+ if you get mean in overall.<br /><br /><br />Grading policy is shown below:<br /><br />10 % from the two Online Graded Quizzes (which means 5 % for the first graded quiz and 5% for the second graded quiz)<br />35 % from the Study Project* <br />55 % from the Final Examination <br /><br />The course is graded from A+ to F. An F grade will not earn you credits for the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />*Note that failure to complete the study project would result in an F grade. <br /><br /><br />Here are some statistics:<br /><br />Quiz 1 (out of 45):<br />Mean: 34.5<br />Highest: 45<br />Lowest: 0<br /><br />Quiz 2 (out of 50):<br />Mean: 39.8<br />Highest: 50<br />Lowest: 0<br /><br />Project (out of 35):<br />Mean: 29.0<br />Highest: 35<br />Lowest: 0<br />SD: 3.5<br /><br />Final Exam (out of 100):<br />Mean: 54.4<br />Highest: 92<br />Lowest: 0<br />SD: 18.2<br /><br /><br />My result:<br /><br />Quiz 1: 33/45 (I have made too many mistakes in this quiz since I have not done any revision when doing this quiz)<br /><br />Quiz 2: 50/50 (I ask sources for this quiz from my friends)<br /><br />Project (I choose the individual one, use nearly three weeks to make a really long and detailed one): 33/35<br /><br />Final Exam: 78/100<br /><br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br /><br />You can see that if you are hardworking enough, plus you are really good at science, you can pick up all the things very quick and get good grade at last.",
            "comment_workload": "If you want to get good grade in this course, you will do many things to secure A range. (so you need to be hardworking, which can drive you crazy just like me)<br /><br />I have finished all end of chapter exercises and had a quite hard time in trying to understand all the things as soon as possible. <br /><br />Here is my background. I did not select chemistry in senior secondary school as the teaching style of the chemistry teacher in my secondary school was really terrible. I only had Form 3 chemistry background to study this course.<br /><br />Also, I just did revision a few days before the final exam since the workload in this semester for me was quite heavy. I did not have time to revise this course throughout the week until the study break period.<br /><br />Luckily, maybe I am good at science, I still managed to cram nearly all things in my brain and can memorize most of them in the final exam. <br /><br />If you just want good grade with least effort, this would not be the one you should consider, take another course instead because CHEM1004 is a torture for me despite I get A grade in this course. <br /><br />😵🙁",

I still find it hard to follow even I study two years of chemistry in secondary school(I dropped it in the third year).",

It is usually set a topic and preform an experiment to prove it or compare the result. He will provide you some material you need for the experiment, he will also assign one of his PHD students to guide your group and give suggestions. But for individual report you won't get this kind of supports. You need to complete the whole report on your own.<br />The final is very difficult, it consist some parts that are not covered in the lecture. But the mean is low too, so the grade is not that bad.",

            "comment_workload": "The 2 quizzes were quite easy and the questions were pretty straightforward, pretty much followed the examples on lecture notes. It's said, by Dr Chan, that individual reports usually score lower than group reports by 1-2 points out of 30. I chose individual and it took me around 20 full hours to finish the whole thing and scored 26.5. The mean of individual was around 21 and that of group was around 22. The final exam consisted of 32 MCs and 3 SQs. Was very similar to the quizzes, low difficulty level as long as revision is enough. Questions include 'What does gold dissolve in?', the answer is aqua regia, HCl and HNO3. Very straightforward and didn't require much processing while answering.",

            "comment_content": "Well, I would have to say that the content was partially new to me. True, some contents did overlap with those that I learned as a high school student, but the contents got more and more challenging as we finished up chapter 1,2,3 and 4. <br /><br />Don't worry, it is definitely not difficult to understand the chemistry concept handled by this course, thats for sure if you make a certain degree of effort. However, what you should worry is that the approach of this chemistry course is hugely different with probably most of the chemistry courses - it is really about chemistry 'in everyday life'.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than understanding the concepts, you should have a tight grip on the everyday usage of certain reactions, chemicals and manufacturing process if you want to do well in this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "I whined about the contents, but this professor is just absolutely fantastic. He performs a lot of interesting experiments, dragging us closer to the course. He is also very willing to answer individual questions after each lecture, and he does so in a very cordial manner.",
            "comment_grading": "Online quizzes... they are quite challenging (its a open notes quiz overall, so this is quite normal) - you will mostly have time issues when you work on the online quizzes. Also, you can't go back to the previous question after pressing next.<br /><br />The final exam covers a lot of contents that was covered in the lectures. It would be a piece of cake if you are completely familiar with all the contents covered in lectures and notes. Well, the mean grade of this test shows that a heavy majorly of students, including me, are not. The professor once stated that memorization is not important in this class, but I think that was a joke. <br /><br />Online Quiz 1: Mean = 36.4/50, SD = ? <br />Online Quiz 2: Mean = 38.7/50, SD = ?<br />Group/Individual Study Project: Mean = 22.7/30, SD = ?<br />Final Exam: Mean = 50.8/100, SD = 19.9<br /><br /><br />My Final Grade: A- (79.9%)",
            "comment_workload": "I am not sure of what the others think about the workload of this course, but I think that it was one of the most time-consuming course that I had to take this semester (it worth it though). <br />You will feel like you are in heaven when you study earlier chapters, which would deal with basic chemistry that I think is either equivalent or lower than high school level. <br />However, when you make it to the second half, you might start to regret taking this course. Again, as a previously mentioned, concepts are not that challenging (at least to me). However, their are damn shit ton of things that you need to memorize. Lets say, instead of just understanding the 'metal replacement reaction', you should thoroughly memorize the refining process of iron ores, aluminum ores...etc. (don't think that the test will give you the chemical formula of those ores, its all about memorization...)<br /><br />For the project, I think hard work definitely pays off.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I heard is that professor tends to give higher grade to group projects than individual projects (in average), but I think that it does not matter if you make enough effort - the fact that you work on individual project won't drag you down as far as you make sufficient effort.",

However, many students who had previously study in chemistry but dropped out before HKDSE would also enrol in this course, which might increase the mean score. The content is basically high school content up to electrical chemistry and some organic chemistry. Students who are not previously studying in chemistry before would find these quite difficult to understand since the pace of the class is quite fast.<br /><br />The handouts is comprehensive and design just like a secondary school textbook. Lecture slides with notes would upload to Canvas and students who do not go to class can also get answers.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Chan is humorus and easy-going. He would demonstrate experiment on lecture hall which effectively arouse students interests. Interesting videos like '學是學非' starring him would also showed. This give students an easier approach on chemistry.",

No mid terms.<br /><br />Dr. Chan would give instructions early for projects so everyone can have enough time to finish it.

(Fine)<br />Chapter 4: The metals in our daily life.<br />Metallic bond, alloys, ionic bond, salts, reactions related with oxygen, water and acid. (Memorisation is needed)<br />Chapter 5: Metals in the industry.<br />All about redox reaction. Including the working principal of rechargeable battery. (This chapter should be the hardest to grasp) <br />Chapter 6: Fire and fuels.<br /><br />Overall, the content is appropriate for those without any chemistry background.
