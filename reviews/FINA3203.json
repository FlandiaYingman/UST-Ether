I dont know what people have said below that he focuses on the logic, which I believe is essential to this abstract concept. But, he fails so miserably. How can he possibly pull that off when he confuses himself (literally 3-4 times he would get confused and say that he will get back to us the next class? like you are reading off the slides, the minimum you can do is understand what is their on the slides?)<br /><br />He did not write a single word in the class. I am not exaggerating. Not a single word. Just spoke everything out, made hyperbolic hand gestures to emphasize his point (when literally would understand), if he had to write he would make huge circles on diagrams or a particular word to emphasize his point (like what even man?),&nbsp;&nbsp;and end every sentence by saying this is easy. The fact that 10 ppl out of 60 showed up is indicative of how good his class was. <br /><br />DONT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM. Seriously dont!",

Besdies the 2, the homework is a group assignment, so it should not take you long to finish them if you divide it up equitably.<br /><br />Again, dont take it with him. You can score decently well if you practice, but some of the concepts are quite abstract, and hard to find explanations even on the internet. I have heard YAN, Ji is a pretty good prof.

It is because ordinary option is super easy for us. These questions test you how to use binomial tree or risk neutral pricing to derive value of those derivatives in different nodes and in T=0.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excel sheet professor provided is not that useful in exam because every question required the use of binomial tree for exotic option. Less than 2 hours are definitely not enough to finish the exam and professor didnt expect us to finish them so dont waste time on unsolvable questions.<br /><br />My final exam score: 107",

            "comment_content": "This course covers one of the most exciting yet fundamental areas in finance: derivative securities. The global derivatives market is one of the most fast-growing markets, with over $600 trillion notional value in total. In the modern financial architecture, financial derivatives can be the most challenging and exotic securities traded by institutional specialists, while at the same time, they can also be the basic securities commonly traded by retail investors such as S&amp;P 500 Index Options. Beyond trading, the basic ideas of financial derivatives serve as building blocks to understand a much broader class of financial problems, such as complex asset portfolios, strategic corporate decisions, and stages in venture capital investing. Therefore, It is as important as ever to understand both the strategic opportunities offered by these derivative instruments and the risks they imply. <br /><br />We discuss a wide range of applications, including the use of derivatives in asset management, the valuation of corporate securities such as stocks and corporate bonds with embedded options, interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives, as well as crude oil derivatives. In addition to theoretical discussions,<br />we also emphasize practical considerations of implementing strategies using derivatives as tools, especially when no-arbitrage conditions do not hold. <br /><br />Topic 1: Introduction to Derivatives<br />L1 - Introduction to Derivatives<br /><br />Topic 2: Forwards and Futures<br />L2 - Forward and Futures contracts<br />L3 - Forwards and Futures on commodities<br />L4 - Forwards and Futures on currencies<br />L5 - Forwards and Futures on interest rates<br /><br />Topic 3: Swaps<br />L6 - Swaps<br /><br />Topic 4: Options Basics<br />L7 - Introduction to options<br />L8 - Option Trading Strategies<br /><br />Topic 5: Binomial Trees<br />L9 - Binomial Tree Models<br />L10 - Multi-step Binomial Tree Models<br /><br />Topic 6: Black-Scholes-Merton model<br />L11 - The Black-Scholes-Merton Model<br />L12 - Delta Hedging in the BSM Model<br />L13 - Some issues with the BSM Model<br /><br />Topic 7: Exotic options and Default<br />L14 - American and Exotic Options<br />L15 - Default modeling and credit derivatives",

Prof also used a lot of examples to simplify the topics and make them easier for us to understand. He focuses more on intuition more than mathematical explanations. So, rather than memorizing examples in ppt or homework, it is more useful to really understand the intuition behind as exam questions won't be exactly the same as those in the ppt or homework.",

Just plug in the numbers, but normally you can remember the formulas.<br /><br />Final Exam: 5 questions, 2 hours, a little bit difficult than the midterm exam, somehow you need your 'wisdom' to show that you are suitable in this field. Like constructing arbitrage opportunity, pricing an exotic option(will not be taught, use No Arbitrage Principle), hedge your portfolio etc.<br /><br />Mean is high, 90+/100, but it should be fine as Professor Yan is very kind.<br /><br />New Update: Exam mean: 72.8, SD:18",

He always tried his best to explain the concepts to students using examples (with the aid of his tablet and excel).<br /><br />The pace of teaching was also fine. Andrew did not only spend time quickly going through the slides. In many of his lectures, he told us real-life trading things (not tested) so if you are interested in trading you will be very happy to listen. He also told jokes frequently to make the lectures less intense.<br /><br />You can ask Andrew questions anonymously on the website he provided and he will reply them in Canvas announcements. He was also very nice that he gave us hints before the two exams<br /><br />Lecture videos were uploaded to Canvas, but the people who recorded them sometimes did not catch up the screens timely.<br /><br />In my opinion, for those who have no idea what derivatives are before taking this course (like me), what calls and puts are, it will be a bit hard for you to catch up.",
