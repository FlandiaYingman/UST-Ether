A number of side topics is talked about in class. But otherwise, still interesting as you can tell his passion towards Buddhism.",

Though there is attendance needed.<br /><br />The 1st quiz had me worried as it was the first time they've had this course. but got well-above the mean. 2nd quiz was during midterm season, sadly BSed through it, but still got a hefty amount of marks, and got a bit above mean. We never got our 3rd quiz back. But I got a B+ in the end, I guess that's the benefit if you take a class full of exchange students :P",
