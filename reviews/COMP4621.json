The course covers the five Internet layer stack and teaches from the top to bottom (except the lowest one physical layer). There might be some extra contents such as wireless networking, security, etc. and you might also learn something about hacking.<br />About 90% concepts and 10% probabilities. Some stuff from COMP3711, 3511, and MATH2411 are also there. Four written assignments and one programming project. Then midterm and final.<br />Programming project was quite challenging.

In my opinion, the hard part is more on the multi-threading than networking.",
