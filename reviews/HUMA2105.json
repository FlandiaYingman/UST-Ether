At the discretion of the instructor, an in-class or public performance would be offered during the term. No prior knowledge or experience of performing arts is required.",

            "comment_content": "To all my classmates: this review is no way against you. You are all extremely talented and wonderful people. You are the best part of this course and it has been an honour to get to know you. We all deserve better.<br /><br />Alright, where do I begin? As a theatre kid, I had really high hopes for this course, especially since there aren't many opportunities in Hong Kong. <br /><br />The lectures were mainly about a very, very brief history of musical theatre and how to create a musical. The best parts of musical theatre weren't talked about. You know, Sondheim, Lloyd Webber and more modern musicals. But it's alright, since this course is very heavy on practical stuff, like acting and singing and dancing. Unfortunately, the lectures don't explain enough, but a large part of the grade is based on performance, especially since you want to put on a show. Besides the performing aspects, tech is really important when you're making a musical, but it's practically never talked about. Us students had to experiment with light, sound and everything else. Actually, we did everything ourselves. How can you expect so much from university students when you don't explain things that most of us aren't familiar with? <br /><br />This course tries to be a lot of things, but never really explains much. In the end, no one truly understands anything except realizing they should've left with half of the people who went to the first lecture. Well, I've lost a lot faith and respect for authority and realized the merits of a decentralized community.",
            "comment_teaching": "They're 'professionals', which means they treat us like we're actual performers and technicians and stage managers and assume we know everything. Well, no we don't. At the same time they think we're kids and can't handle more complicated stuff, like lights. They're very opinionated and insistent but they're not paying attention to us. Our class is almost entirely free range and we did almost everything ourselves. If these are people working in theatre I understand why Broadway performers and backstage crew are pissed off.<br />I heard a rumour that the instructors play favourites. This is not an attack on any particular student. You are all amazing. If you got a better grade you earned it.",
            "comment_grading": "YOU CAN'T GRADE ART<br />The grading is extremely unclear and confusing. I'm pretty certain that it uses absolute grading. But the grades are shit.<br /><br />This is what it says in the Syllabus section on Canvas:<br /><br />Exam 20%<br />Final Group Project 20%<br />2nd Group Project 20%<br />1st Group Project 10%<br />Attendance 10%<br />Script writing and Mock Audition 15%<br />Performance review 5%<br />However, script writing and mock audition both have a full mark of 5.<br /><br />Now let's look at what it says in the Grades section on Canvas:<br />ATTENDANCE\t10%<br />Group Project 1\t10%<br />Group Project 2\t20%<br />Final Project\t20%<br />Final Exam\t20%<br />Other Assignments\t20%<br />Total\t100%<br /><br />Notice that 'other assignments' is 20%. My first instinct was that all three assignments were weighted the same.<br /><br />So you've delivered the greatest performance of your life. You think you'll get a good grade, right? Nope, everyone gets the same mark. And you have an exam that has the same weighting as your performance. Granted, this is an attempt to ensure 'fairness' for students who participated in backstage work, but honestly, what's the point of working your ass off when you're just going to study anyway? Oh, and if you suck at performing, too bad. If you're an awkward introvert like me, sucks to be you because no one fucking remembers or likes you. <br /><br />Maybe I'm stupid, but this grading system is a hot complicated pile of flaming dogshit. My CGA got fucked over.",
            "comment_workload": "3 hour rehearsal almost every day for 2 weeks. I liked it. But it was exhausting and definitely not worth 3 credits. <br /><br />Too many group projects in my opinion. They could just cut the second one and give us more time to refine our show. Do you know how hard it is to write a script and lyrics? Do you know how fucking hard it is to write a coherent plot and characters and think of words that rhyme and have similar meanings? Oh and do you know how you have to figure out the script, no the basic outline of the story before you can even start with the songs and choreography? And you have to do all that in one. Fucking. Month.<br /><br />It's ironic how most musicals are about the working poor who fight against the oppressive ruling class, but the instructors are entirely oblivious to the fact that the rich, powerful people are not role models. <br /><br />Fuck this course. Fuck the instructors. Fuck everything.",

Nothing interesting.<br /><br />The aesthetics of the instructors are quite obsolete, which I suspect is because one of them received her musical theatre education in the 1970s when the best of Broadway was yet to come, and the other is actually an opera singer instead of a musical practitioner.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teachers make it difficult for me to think positively of them. Mandy Petty (a British white female) and Isaac Droscha (an American white male) are the most negative, abusive, narcissistic people, and all-around the worst instructors I've ever met in this university.<br /><br />They like to mock, question, and yell at students. They frequently make mistakes and wouldn't let students correct them. They yell all the time and curse when they talk to students, make personal remarks, and generally talk in a disrespectful way and can't keep it professional.<br /><br />Their instructions are unclear (especially Petty's, and she refuses to clarify or answer questions, by saying &quot;just do as I say&quot;). Then they throw us under the bus if we can't do exactly what they want (because we struggle to understand them in the first place).<br /><br />I immensely regret enrolling in this course. It's a very unpleasant experience and a massive waste of time. Speaking from my own experience, I highly recommend everyone to stay away from it.",

One, Mandy Petty, taught us dance and movement and the other, Mark Ngan, gave us vocal training. Both are extremely skilled and likeable.

Us students did most things on our own. <br />Just an example of their teaching: we are required to do a monologue for the mock audition which was part of the grade, but they arranged an acting class after the mock audition was due. It does not make any sense to me. I don't think they really understand what it means to teach a 'student' and we are not 'majored in ART' lol, you can't expect everyone to be talented in performing.",

They will teach singing, dancing and acting in class, so for those who wanted to learn these or have a keen interest in being a performer in musicals or dramas, this course is perfect for you.",
            "comment_teaching": "These two instructors are very nice and are very proactive to help students. They give detailed and very useful guidance on aspects of performing arts and talks to us about their experiences as performers. It's great to learn from someone who is very experienced.",
            "comment_grading": "I haven't received my final grading yet, but now we already have handed in 1 group project and 3 assignments. We also did a mock audition in which they grade us on our dancing and singing. All these components take up 50% of our final grade. I got around 90% out of this 50%. The instructors are very loose on the grading and tends to give students higher marks.",
            "comment_workload": "You will do around 10 hours of work each week, although it might sound a lot for a 3-credit course, around 5 hours of it are rehearsals and singing practice, so rather than work you could consider it as self-relaxation and enjoyment if you are interested in this area. If you are a deadline fighter you might find this course very stressful, but if you started do your planning and brainstorming earlier it's definitely affordable. You also make a lot of friends during the course as the whole class would have to produce a musical together which will be performed by the end of November. I would say this is working and playing at the same time.",

The lessons were almost all conducted on zoom except some face to face coaching (depends on your group). If you like watching musical plays and learning related knowledge, it would be a great course, otherwise, it might be a little boring. There were also singing, dancing and acting tutorial videos posted on canvas but they just required us to watch them by ourselves. Most of the time you will be just working on your project with your groupmates.",
