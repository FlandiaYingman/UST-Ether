Our session is co-facilitated by Dr Po-lung Li. Only 2 lectures in the whole semester and TWO 30-minutes consultation periods. Within these two lectures, instructors will tell you what you have to write exactly. For two consultation periods, the instructors will go through your product (incl. interim report at week 7 and final report at week 13) one by one. They will offer you some grammar advice and also touch on something about coherence and cohesion. I believe that their opinions and experiences really help me out when your capstone supervisor is an English-speaking professor / lecturer. When you meet these people, their help is really important to brush up your paper. For all Humanities and Social Science students, you have to know good English is quite important for delivering concrete and accurate ideas. Therefore, please do pay attention in class and raise any questions if you have any doubts when you are writing your paper. Both lang instructors definitely will help you out.",

I have no doubt that he had delivered his concerns and expectations clearly. I particularly recommend people joining his classes or his iLang 1-on-1 consultation sessions.",
