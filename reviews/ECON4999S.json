        "description": "This course has two objectives: 1) To explore how Economics can be used to understand health and education, and 2) to provide tools and skills to evaluate program and policy in this field. It will start with a review of economic tools to evaluate impacts of programs and policies: micro-econometrics including OLS, IV approach, diff-in-diff estimation, and regression discontinuity design. Rest of the course will focus on recent empirical papers on health and education economics.",

            "comment_content": "The course is a combination of econometrics theory and examples (the experiment designs in all the papers) that help you learn how to interpret econ research papers.<br />Personally, I believe it's important for ECON students to take such a course as it differs from most other ECON courses which require a bunch of calculations instead of a real understanding of econ research. Even if you don't want to pursue a career in academia, you could still learn a lot in this course, and I mean it.",
            "comment_teaching": "Bryant is fun, nice, and very helpful. He's also very experienced in econ research on various topics. He could've become a doctor but he instead chose to be a health economist lol. Definitely our gain.<br />The first half (before midterm) is a review of econometrics theory while the second half is the professor and all the students doing presentations on research papers. <br />I would say what matters is that you need to spend time figuring out the logic in all the papers, and the professor can't put everything into your brain just through teaching, but Bryant is definitely very helpful and explains things well. You can always ask him questions after class or come to his office hours.",
            "comment_grading": "Believe me when I say it's quite lenient. Apparently, Bryant believes in encouraging students to study by giving better letter grades as rewards. A rather balanced weighting in all assignments/projects/exams gives you better chances of getting good grades. Messing up one/more than 1 of them won't be the end of the world.",
            "comment_workload": "The downside of having &quot;a rather balanced weighting in all assignments/projects/exams&quot;. 2hws, 2 reaction papers, 1 presentation of research paper and a team research proposal. But I have to say that most assignments/projects are not a waste of time and do facilitate your learning process.",

            "comment_content": "The course is divided into two halves, the first half revised econometrics concepts that are necessary for reading papers, and the second half we studied various recent economic papers related to health and education. The content is very practical, and the prof never dives too deep into theories, but focus on how to apply them in real world research. This is the first course that actually taught me useful things about doing researches and reading papers.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Kim’s lectures are very enjoyable. He is very good at teaching, and is quite humorous and would share a lot of personal stories with us during the lectures. Prof Kim actually cares about teaching and guiding UG students a lot ( unlike some of the UST prof…) , he designed the course very carefully, and always welcomes us to visit his office. He would give participation marks to encourage attendance, but he will also provide recordings for all the lectures.",
            "comment_grading": "Prof’s grading is VERY lenient, he told me he would normally give 3 A+ for a 20 people course ! That’s a hella 15% A+ rate, probably up to 30-40% A range. Normally other professors would give at most 1 A+ sometimes none for a small 4000 level class.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload of this course is quite high, way more than 4 credits in my opinion. In the first half of the semester there are two written homework for econometrics. After midterm, we need to learn STATA and finish a coding homework. Each person will have to present one paper in class, but we need to be familiar with all the 20 something papers, and need to write two reaction papers based on two of them. At the end of the semester, apart from the final exam which is during the last class, we also need to write a paper proposal in group of 2-3 using the knowledge we learned. Actually a lot of these assignments are effort based, but the professor will read the reaction papers and research proposal himself. <br />However, all these workload are quite rewarding, and this is one of the few courses in UST that made me feel like I really learned something.",
