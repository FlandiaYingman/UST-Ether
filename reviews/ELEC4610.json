            "comment_teaching": "There are two lectures per week, but it emphasizes a lot on self-learning. One of the weekly lectures is always pre-recorded, as the professor hopes for us to make better use of our time to watch the videos on our own. Essentially, there is only one real-time lecture each week. <br /><br />Professor Qu is a good professor explaining the concepts well. Most of the content stem from high/secondary physics. If you are familiar in optics, you will have little to no difficulty in understanding its content. It's also one of the few courses that do not involve a lot of calculus.<br /><br />Things become crappy when it comes to examinations, however. Similar to other engineering courses, you need to set up a 360-no-scope camera capturing your upper body, your paper and your computer screen. Nice! What's more, you'll be awarded bonus points if you use a handwritten cheat sheet. Honestly speaking, I don't see the significance in such restrictions as well as the merits of using a handwritten but not typed cheat sheet. I'd feel less stressful in a face-to-face exam compared with an online one.",

While there are 6 pieces of &quot;homework&quot; in total, each piece is also further separated into two assignments, with each assignment released one week after the another. Homework 5 is the only exception with an extra section C asking you to write a 400-word summary of Newton's rings, meaning there are actually 13 pieces of homework in total.",
            "comment_workload": "As said in the grading section, the weighing for the homework can be very confusing unless you have actually taken the course. On average, each assignment (not going to use the term homework, refer to the grading section for more details) consists of 5 questions, so you should have adequate time to complete each of them.<br /><br />Since the course is conducted online, there will be no hands-on labs this semester. Instead, video recordings are provided for each experiment, along with a supplementary datafile containing the values you need to calculate the result. Lab reports were written by students individually, not group. Because of this, it is not necessary to attend any lab sections according to the schedule as long as you submit the report within the deadline, i.e. 1 week.<br /><br />While the workload is manageable, you have to always pay attention to any updates on its Canvas page, causing unneeded tension from my perspective. Submissions are usually opened just 3 days before its deadline rather than at the time of its release, so it's easy to miss it even if you already completed the assignments. For me, I missed two pieces of homework assignments because I forgot to hand it in.",
