Kelvin's lectures just present you the theory but not the application. Drilling past paper would consolidate your concepts and Kelvin's paper are similar to ACCA paper :)<br /><br />Heavy workload for sure since each assignment is difficult and I am extremely stressful about exams.

Some answers can be found online so the mean is quite close to full mark.<br /><br />Examinations are both open book open notes. Doing ACCA questions are quite useful as 1 midterm question is copied from ACCA. Besides, only reading notes is not enough and ACCA questions provide more practice opportunities and examples.<br /><br />For midterm, there are 3 questions on topic 1 to 3 (exclude salaries tax computation). There are 1 question on tax administration and offense, 1 on property tax computation, and 1 on salaries tax scope and source.<br /><br />For final, there are 4 questions on all topics. There are 1 on profits tax computation, 1 on salaries tax computation (2 year comp with explanations) and personal assessment, 1 on depreciation allowance, 1 on profits tax scope and source. Kelvin will tell you about each question on the last class so do attend it!
