        "description": "The course introduces students to core legal principles of transnational economic law and the mechanisms for the settlement of trade and investment disputes. The topics discussed are closely related to world-wide current events that affect transnational law and dispute resolution. The lectures examine how domestic laws, and regional and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. The course covers decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that affect the activities and governance of private and state-owned multinational corporations. Students will learn how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration, mediation, and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy.",
