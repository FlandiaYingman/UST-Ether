You just stepped into the hell with your own foot!<br /><br />ENGG1150 covers all lame and boring computer related contents that may fry your brain. Nevertheless, if you do manage to overcome it all, you will be awarded with sweet gradings.<br /><br />This course is a dungeon of computer engineering. The basic contents covers the history and evolution of computer engineering and software developments. <br /><br />You will meet various inventions, founders, events, systems, and logics that is worth around 9 lectures with each conters covering over 50 ppt pages.<br /><br />Still duable you think? Well only fact is that you should memorize it all. No worries, if you suceed in doing so, A is kinda gaurenteed.",

            "comment_grading": "I would say grading is good. <br /><br />I got A- overall which was not my expectation but it worked well eventually.<br /><br />The grading happens with quizzes, 2 group presentation and review section, 2500 word individual term paper and own presentation, and final exam which covers all 9 lectures at once.",
            "comment_workload": "Yeap this is the one and only reason why you are in hell in this course.<br /><br />Here are things you should complete for the course.<br /><br />- 9 quizzes which each covers the contents of 50 page ppts.<br />- Group presentation regaridng software inventions and social delamas.<br />- 2500 word essay regarding the topic you choose (I would say category since the essay topic is strickly on you).<br />- 3 minuets presentation about the entire summary of your 2500 word term paper.<br />- Final examination covering all the contents of the entire lectures.<br /><br />If this does not sound a lot for 3 credit course? Man I am not sure what will satify you anymore.<br /><br />However, once you overcome it all the grade is worth the entire sufferages!",

That being said, you may feel there is heavy content coming at you at any time, and it's important to be good at taking notes.<br /><br />With this course, you will thrive if you put in the effort.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Wong is quite familiar with his slides, which are heavy with information. Our first few classes started a bit slow (which to me was...hmm, the right pace?), so we sped up later on. This meant I had to use time after class to finish my notes. <br />Wong's lectures don't require interaction, but he likes to make sure that we're paying attention by reminding us to switch on our cameras, at least for the first and last 5 mins of class (which I find reasonable and good as it offers everyone a sense of classroom and learning together). I also think that he has a lot of knowledge and experience on this topic.<br /><br />The TAs are helpful too :)",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is fair: even students who have no prior knowledge can get into A range, which meets the introductory level of which this course is designed.<br /><br />- Quizzes (best 5/7)<br />- Individual topic (essay + 3min presentation)<br />- Group presentation (15-20 mins)<br />- Final exam<br />- Peer evaluation<br /><br />The research essay is to be chosen from a range of topics and the 3 min presentation is to simply provide a summary to the essay. The grading is fair and on your research &amp; writing skills.<br /><br />One can never expect too much for group presentations. Certain topics might be easier.<br /><br />Perhaps as a result of e-learning, the exam is split into 4 sections: ABCD, the question types versatile, including T/F, multiple choice, and short responses. Dr. Wong and the TAs are quite transparent about grading and will post the score break downs for each individual part.<br />Owing to good revision, I scored well for A and B (&gt;1 SD above the mean) but didn't do well in one question in pt C due to time pressure (1 SD below the mean for that one). I did so-so with pt D. Overall I scored above the mean by &lt;1 SD for the exam.<br /><br />P.S. The exam is open LECTURE notes (i.e. the ppt slides by Dr. Wong)",

(like me, who voluntarily put in extra effort to carry my group, even though I've got no background and they're technically CS students ...?? *tedious sigh*)<br /><br />Also, studying really helps with this course; if you're willing to put in the right effort, it's quite likely that you can do well. <br />If you're new to information tech and tech in general, like me, study and try to engage yourself with other educational resources (e.g. videos on Computer Science, as this is somewhat a intro computer science course)",
