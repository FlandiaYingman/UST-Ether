            "comment_content": "In MATH 4999, you can self-designed the project title and everything in the report. Personally, I am particularly interested in the financial market so I did something related to financial statistics (Volatility Modeling, Sentiment, Time-series study, stochastic modeling, etc) quantitative trading (options pricing, derivatives trading, and arbitrage trading), and trading using machine learning with different strategies (CNN, RNN, GAN, SVM, etc). As a student in both math and CS, basically, I just want to explore everything I learned and apply them to real-world scenarios.<br /><br />In the project, I also explored different programming languages like Python, R, STATA, MATLAB, C#, and the most important one --- LATEX, which is a useful and common immediate to write mathematics reports. I think it could be a fruitful research experience for both your postgraduate and career development.<br /><br />LATEX: https://www.overleaf.com/",
            "comment_teaching": "There is no teaching and guideline in this course. Everything in the report is self-learned. However, if you face some difficulties, I think you could ask the supervisor. Although I only contacted my supervisor 3 to 4 times in the whole semester through email, I believe they are more than happy to answer your questions. Just to be reminded that work under a supervisor that is capable to teach you. However, if you are interested in pure mathematics, you can find professors that have strong research interests in algebra or geometry. If you are interested in applied Mathematics, you can find a professor that has a strong interest in physics, engineering or biological mathematics, etc.<br /><br />https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/people/faculty.php",
            "comment_grading": "The only grader of this course &quot;seems&quot; to be your supervisor. From most of the students I know who also enrolled in MATH 4999, most of them can get at least B+/A-. However, I think it really depends on the effort you spent, and the supervisor's preference.<br /><br />I am not sure if the grading scheme is different among supervisors, but for most of the supervisors, the only grading component is your report.<br /><br />Grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "Light. Personally, I just spent around 15 days completing the project, with around 5 hours per day. 12 days for the project content and 3 days for writing a report using LATEX. 75 hours should be light for a 3-credit course, especially when you love what you are doing. But it really depends on your effort and the difficulty of your report.<br /><br />Also, I know some of the students contacted the supervisor in advance and completed half of the work in the summer. So you can have much better time management in the fall semester.",
