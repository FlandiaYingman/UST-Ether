        "description": "Network is an important determinant of success in oneâ€™s careers and business, yet the understanding of its role is often ill-conceived or simply mystified. This course will help students understand and manage their social networks, exploring the fundamentals of social network analysis. In this regard, the course has two parts. First, students will learn key concepts (and also common mis-concepts) of social network through readings, on-line and in-class simulations. Second, students will learn specific technics of social network analysis, which will help them gain deeper and more correct understanding of the social networks. Finally, students will have the chance to apply these knowledge in an individual project that they initiate. The course evaluation will be primarily focused on the project.",
