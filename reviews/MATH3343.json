            "comment_content": "The syllabus on his website is not accurate, here is the syllabus in 2019 Spring.<br />But the instructor said he is going to change the content of this course, I don't know whether the following is still applicable.<br /><br />1. Perfect Cover; Game of Nim<br />2. Pigeon Hole Principle, Ramsey Theorem<br />3. Permutations and Combinations <br />4. Algorithms for Generating Permutation and Combinations; Partially Ordered Sets<br />5. Binomial Coefficients<br />6. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (on Linear Ordered Sets)<br />-------------------Midterm-------------------<br />7. Mobius Function, Mobius Inversion<br />8. Recurrence Relations and Generating Functions<br />9. Special Counting Sequence: Difference Operator; Stirling Number<br />10. Marriage Problem<br /><br />In general, this course covered lots of things, but usually they are uncorrelated, so the midterm and final is not cumulative. <br /><br />The topics are quite funny for me and some of them are useful like the Recurrence Relations and Generating Functions. <br />Though some the topics are not that useful if you are not in the Pure Math Track, but this course essentially makes you more mature mathematically.<br /><br />Prof Chen also always mentioned Machine Learning stuffs during lectures, I guess the topics are somehow related to CS application, like the Graph Theory.<br />He also added a bit to this course from his research topics which you cannot find it in the textbook.<br /><br />Anyway, the course content can be organized in a better way.",
            "comment_teaching": "I skipped most of the lectures since 10:30am is too early for me.<br /><br />Most of the contents are trivial according to Prof Chen, he usually goes through his lecture notes during lectures like other professors from the MATH department. For some abstract concepts, he would give intuitive ideas to explain. <br /><br />During the lectures before the midterm and final exam, Prof Chen will ask what kind of questions and which topic that we want them to be appeared in the exam paper, he will then decide the exam coverage in these 2 lectures, just attend this 2 lectures is enough for this course I think. <br />And the exam questions are indeed what he mentioned in the class, he is really kind.",

Personally, I can only understand 50~60% of the lecture if I don't read the notes in advance.
