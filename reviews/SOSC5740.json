        "description": "The primary goal of this course is to provide advanced research students the rare opportunity of learning how to conduct theoretically-guided empirical research on the study of China from a social science perspective. The instructor will, through presentation of his various research projects, show how a solid piece of research work is conducted from its inception to the final stage of publications. Students taking this course are expected to present their own work following the methodological format as required by the instructor, and to critically discuss the work of their peers. It is hoped that, by taking this course students who are keen on developing a research career will be able to sharpen their research skills and ideas as a result. To be able to perform solid empirical analysis, students are required to have taken SOSC 5340 prior to taking this course. The instructor assumes that students taking the proposed course have acquired most of the necessary skills required for understanding the course materials and for conducting their own research project.",
