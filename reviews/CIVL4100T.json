        "description": "Remote sensing from space is a powerful technique to gather information about the Earthâ€™s land, water, and air over wide areas and continuously in time. It is used extensively in civil and environmental engineering for site investigation, resource exploration, urban growth monitoring, detection of natural hazards (e.g., landslides, floods, earthquakes, etc) and other applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is critically needed to extract meaningful information from the vast amounts of diverse datasets generated by satellite remote sensing. This course introduces applications of AI in remote sensing. It covers the principles underlying remote sensing, various remote sensing technologies, satellite data preparation for AI analysis, and common AI techniques for remote sensing research and applications in civil and environmental engineering.",
