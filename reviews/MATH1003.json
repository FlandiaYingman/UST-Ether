But after midterm1, he conducted class survey and there are apparent changes in teaching method. Instead of reading powerpoint,he writes everything step by step on the whiteboard and makes it easier to follow. His teaching and accent aren't really good but I would say he do care about our feelings and learning.<br /><br />TA Kitty<br />She is quite nice and willing to teach you. She prepares her own notes in tutorials. Many exercises are included in tutorials and it do help. Basically if you don't go to lecture and just read the textbook yourself and attend tutorials, you can still perform good in exam.",

Many non-compulsory textbook exercises are assigned for each chapter. Practices makes perfect. I think doing exercises is a important way to learn math. <br /><br />Some suggestions that may help you in this course. ( You may not agree but just find the way that suits you&nbsp;&nbsp;most)<br /><br />-textbook is super expensive,just make sure you have an electronic version (get it form your seniors !!!) <br /><br />-even if you understand everything in lecture, do some required textbook questions. It is more worthy to do basic questions than some very difficult application problems as the exam only focus on basic concepts.<br /><br />-if you find the materials too difficult, seek help from TA or go to Math Support Centre( lift3 ,room 3011)<br />do find a nice person that you feel comfortable with to ask questions. I usually go there when TA Kitty is o duty in MSC. Be proactive and patient in MSC :)",

As most of the students taking this course are business students, the syllabus also covers some applications of the mathematical concepts, like two-industries models and marginal analysis in economics. The content in this course can hence be applied in other business core courses, for example, I found the mathematics for finance particularly useful in accounting course, which covers the computation of bonds' present value.<br /><br />Although some examples covered in differentiation and integration require the use of calculators, Mid-term 2 (just testing differentiation) and Final Exam (testing differentiation and integration) mainly examine your ability to apply the concepts taught. Those questions do not appear in these exams, hence no calculators are allowed.",

However, he is not always able to make verbal explanations of the concepts clearly. If you have no idea about what he is talking about, referring to the white board might be a good choice for you.<br /><br />TA is Kitty. She makes her own tutorial notes, including some crucial formulas and concepts for each topic, followed by a lot of exercises. The tutorial notes are pretty useful and she will put the solution of the exercises on her own webpage. She will also go through some questions to clear our misunderstandings. In spite of her low voice which makes the tutorials a bit boring, I still think that attending the tutorials is beneficial to you.",

            "comment_teaching": "I would say his teaching does not have any special. One good thing about him is that he explains detailly for each questions on the powerpoint slides which is a good thing for math idiots like me. Also, he is also very willing to answer questions even though that question seems dumb. However, his tone is king of monotone and boring which will be easily fell asleep. Fortunately, my class is a zoom class so you can skip the lessons. For me, I skipped the lessons since integration because it is manageable to read the book and powerpoint slides in canvas. And I know some friends skipped his lessons since lesson 2 but they still got A+ so it is not necessary to go to the lectures.",
            "comment_grading": "Online homework (WeBWork): 10 %(me:100/100)<br />basically, everyone can get full marks in webwork because there are unlimited attempts which allows us to guess the answer for many times. <br />Midterm Exam: 25 %(me:20/30, mean:14.9, median:14, sd:5.7) <br />Final Exam: 65%(me:89/120, mean:49, median:47, sd:24) <br />For the midterm exam, all questions are mc and many questions doesn't require us to calculate, instead it is asking concepts so many of us couldn't answer the questions. Make sure to grasp the concepts well. <br />For the final exam, make sure to check carefully for the long questions because one question constitutes for 20 marks which is important to your final mark. I perform worse in mc because I just got above mean little in mc but in long questions I got way higher than the mean for almost 40 marks. So check your long questions and I would say long questions are the easiest in the final because they are very standard which are the same as past paper. I recommend you to practice more for curve sketching because there must be a long question each year and also for the evaluation of the indefinite integrals, definite integrals and area between curves because past paper has these type of questions as well and basically they are very mechanical which means practice makes perfect. This will ensure you to gain a lot of marks in this course. <br />Final grading: A- only because my mc performs worse in final and some careless mistakes in long questions. Overall percentage: 75%",
            "comment_workload": "very light workload with only 7 webworks and each webworks has 2 weeks for us to do, so enough time to finish. Also, the questions are simple which one webwork only takes around 30 minutes to finish. Also, if you don't know any questions, you can go to math support center to ask for help, just in case you need it. <br />The workload comes from the preparation of midterm and final because he will give you a list of self-practice questions from the textbook and also suggested solutions which involves many questions. So spare some time to finish the self-practice questions for a good grade. However, I would say self-practice questions for matrix is kind of useless because the midterm about matrix is all conceptual questions and only involves little application problems like Leontief Input-Output Analysis. Do practice more curve sketching, optimization problems, indefinite integrals, definite integrals and finding area between curves.",

He takes the time to write down solutions of in-class questions step by tep in detail, which helps a great deal. The fact that he teaches relatively slowly is a plus for math dummies like me, since it makes it much more easier to follow.

The content is extremely useful in studying business in the future years, so I guess the content is still pretty good.",

Anyways, Weiping is extremely patient and does not mind staying after class to answer students' questions. The TAs are also very nice and patient.

So usually you can get full mark for this part as long as you don't miss the deadlines.<br /><br />Mid-term covers finances and matrices. Not too hard if you do the pastpapers posted on Canvas. However, the question types from mid-term and textbooks is slightly different, so I don't suggest doing textbook questions too much. However, one of the long question in mid-term was from the textbook. Should be pretty good grade if you understand the concepts very clearly though.<br /><br />Final exam was a disaster for many people, but that again, if you do the pastpapers you should be fine. Because the format of the pastpapers is almost THE SAME with finals, many just the MCs and numerical values changed. Just remember to ask around the higher year people for pastpaper resources, since the professor only uploads one or two pastpapers which are not too similar to finals. If you can find pastpapers that the professor did not upload, chances are you are going to get another paper that is extremely similar to finals.<br /><br />Does not count attendance, so I could skip math tutorials.

For beginners in calculus, make sure you make good use fo your time after mid-term to master your skills in differentiation and integration as they are pretty tough for the beginners.<br />3.

Though the webwork question is sometimes a bit tricky ( like the ones that are the very last few questions) but then with infinitely many attempts for all the questions, it is not too hard to attain full score. Seek help from Maths centre if necessary. Symbolab and Wolfram-Alpha might be a good tool to help you finish the earlier question from Webwork but try to finish it yourself as a few extra practices for yourself.",

The geometric sequence and matrix taught before midterm will be fine if u do enough exercises.",

Sometimes she provides detailed steps or notes which are not shown on the ppt and those notes are quite useful. The TA is also good and is willing to answer questions but the tutorial's pace is much slower so if u have already understood the concepts in lectures u may not need to attend the tutorials. No attendance required for both lecture and tutorial.",

Basically the past paper is useless. I can score more than 80% for the past paper, but can only score ~ 60% in the real paper. 9 MCs and 3 Long questions. Seems that the paper is that long, right?

Midterm 2 would be differentiation while final will focus more on integration but there are some questions from previous parts since it is cumulative.<br /><br />Financial Mathematics and Matrices are easy. Pay attention in class and do sufficient practices will help in midterm. Differentiation and Integration would be more difficult especially for people who never learn it before. It requires some basic understanding of limits (urghhh I never understand it) to do well but you can keep doing those textbook practices until you are familiar with the questions.<br /><br />And yes, some webwork questions were super hard but I asked my seniors to solve it lol. Sometimes you can solve it by using online calculators (eg mathway).<br /><br />Textbook is useful. Get one and do the exercises.",

You will get half of the marks for attendance so it's not that important lol.<br /><br />Basically the midterms are as important as the final so you must do well for both midterms if you wanna get an A-range grade. <br /><br />I don't think the grading is harsh because it is not that hard to get an A-range grade compared to the other courses (this course is my grade saviour for this semester lol). <br /><br />Midterm 1 - 79/80 (higher 1 sd)<br />Midterm 2 - 55/80 (around mean)<br />Final&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 95/100 (higher 1 sd)<br /><br />Total 88% out of 100.<br /><br />My marks for all papers are as above and I got an A for my final grade because I screwed my midterm 2 (yes I hate differentiation it was so damn difficult lol).

Maybe just five long questions each chapter, it is more than enough for u to prepare for exams as the pattern of exam questions is repetitive. Just ditch all the maths lectures cuz it's useless, if you are shit at maths, go to the maths tutorials, msc and find urself a frd that is gd at maths. And you must be sensational towards the question during exam in order to apply a correct approach. Peace ✌🏻.",
