            "comment_content": "3 Hr class may seem boring on paper. But he breaks it down into like 1h20mins lecture and 1h20 mins activity like group discussion or group activity. <br /><br />Like his Ethics class, he always starts the class with world news , then go through the assigned readings and lecture notes for the day. <br /><br />Pretty chill content, but he only teaches the content that are rather important , if u want more information, you better read the whole book on your own.",
            "comment_teaching": "He is a very friendly and nice teacher, always encouraging student's participation. He goes through what we are supposed to read from the book and articles and always give his opinion over some matters. <br />However it may be boring over time as it is always the same format, which may explains a lot of reviews saying how boring it could be. But since it is a 3hr class, it is in fact actually maybe 1h20mins lecture, and then the other half is just group discussion or an activity related to the topic we are doing. It can be very fun and less boring if you are active and willing to participate.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is fair, cause most of the assignments are team-related. And final exam is an essay. So it is quite subjective. <br />There is also participation and the whole class is mostly based on active participation. If u are willing to participate, then u can expect fair grade.",

            "comment_content": "Only writing this because I don't think some of the reviews (for 2017-2018 fall sem) are fair. Yes, the professor is boring and the lecture content is pretty much useless (not like I was expecting anything else, I was only taking it just in case I cannot graduate because it was a core course and I knew in Spring sem 2017 the MGMT department suddenly cancelled the other core course), but it is pretty good grade IMO (as long as you ain't dumb).",
            "comment_teaching": "Yeah professor is boring but that's why you can exploit this and get good grade. Bunch of half-wits don't listen in class so if you pay a bit of attention on important parts (stories and fill in the blanks as mentioned in my 'Grading' part), you should be able to get at least an A-range. <br /><br />And just to be fair to the professor, he is boring but by no means is he a prick. I have seen professors worse than him. He is by far the most lenient and chill professor I have seen. it's just that the students are as good as dead and won't be willing to answer any questions, so don't just blame it on the professor (although I wasn't the ones who answer question either, but hey I got a decent grade out of it)",
            "comment_grading": "There are plenty of course components, but then most of them can be satisfied by simply submitting your assignments and attending classes. <br /><br />As you can see in the attached syllabus, around 26.45% of the total grade can be achieved by handing in assignments (doubt he reads it I spent like 30 minutes bs-ing) and attending classes (PRS). There are bunch of idiots who managed to submit the work late and lose some points here and there (or miss the PRS... whatever). <br /><br />There is this presentation that may or may not matter, I was in the first batch of groups to present, which means I had less than one week to prepare the presentation. We hea did our presentation (honestly, less than 1 hour of work from everyone) and it was still better than most people (got like 0.2 marks off highest?).<br /> <br />Main differentiator is the mid term and final. Both are just MC and short essay questions, non-cumulative. MCs are only tricky because sometimes he will ask a question on some 'stories' he tells in class, so whenever he said he has a story, just listen up and jot down the details (won't be in the slides). Also try to look at where he left blanks in the slides and fill it in when he goes through it in class. Otherwise, don't bother listening, not like HRM is complicated anyways, everything is common sense in MGMT. Short questions ain't too bad, in the final he simply used the same question as one of the ones he put in the lecture slides, so I guess just make sure you look at them also. <br /><br />I got 45/50 (3 marks off high i guess? Mean was like 40, SD like 4.5+?) in mid term, dunno about final but final grade A+. So for the reviews that blame it on bad grading even though you guys got 1SD above mean in mid term, you can suck it, you obviously f**ked it in the final.",
            "comment_workload": "Easy. Even if you have to hard carry the presentation I don't think it's that bad (leave yourself around 3 days to do the presentation is enough --&gt; Our PowerPoints are filled with bullet points.<br /><br />For mid term and final, just revise a bit beforehand. Pretty good to brush grade from my point of view (obviously you might read other reviews and think otherwise).",
