Examples include Raoult's Law, Henry's Law, thermodynamic eqm, and electrochemical eqm, etc. <br /><br />However, due to the limit of time and resources, some other interesting pchem expts are not covered. It would be better if we students could also get a taste on these rather than just understanding the related theories and calculations through boring pchem lectures.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is clear and logical, except that Dr. Tung usually speaks very fast. As long as you understand the lab manuals well, are able to follow her logic during lab briefing sessions, and are good at using Excel, your lab reports will be perfectly fine.",
            "comment_grading": "Quite good imo.<br /><br />I personally receive an A+ with total score &gt;95%. Thanks Dr. Tung for giving me this special Christmas gift~ XD<br /><br />If you desire an A range, you should aim at full score for lab quizzes and nearly full score for lab reports. These are the only items that you could control by yourself. Frankly, I don't have ideas how the TAs grade our lab performance. But from my observation, if you don't freeride your labmate and are able to quickly and smoothly finish the labwork, you are likely to score high.",
            "comment_workload": "As a 1 credit course, the workload is a bit higher than my expectation.<br /><br />While the workload for preparing lab quizzes is acceptable, it is especially time-consuming for doing lab reports. I have to double or even triple check the figures before I click the submit button to avoid careless mistakes or typos. The system simply doesn't allow resubmission even before deadline!!! (How user-unfriendly it is!!!) <br /><br />Also, to avoid problems arising from rounding off in calculations, it is essential to take at least 7 d.p. if the question does not otherwise specify.",
