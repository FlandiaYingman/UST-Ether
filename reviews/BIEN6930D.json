        "description": "Synthetic biology is the science of applying the principles of computation and engineering to biological systems. It is based on the understanding that cells, genetic networks, signaling pathways and other biological phenomena interconnect in ways that allow adaptation to new circumstances. This adaptability can be exploited to solve real-world problems in industry, agriculture, and medicine. Synthetic biology brings together biology, biotechnology, computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics to create useful genetic tools and platforms. It is also a strategy to help us understand basic biological regulatory mechanisms and complex genetic networks: by designing and building artificial ones, we learn how they work in nature (understanding by building). In this course, you will study the theoretical underpinnings of cutting-edge research in synthetic biology and learn how the development of disruptive technologies, combined with engineering principles, led to the emergence of this new scientific field. You will also learn how basic theory and knowledge of biology can guide the rational design of artificial biological circuits in living cells to accomplish well-defined goals. The goal of the course is to help you acquire essential techniques in synthetic biology, such as designing and constructing genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems, and develop new perspectives and skills that may help you in the future meet the demands of the biotech industry and academia.",
