        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, redefining humans' roles and responsibilities in many cognitive tasks such as predicting, evaluating, and making decisions. The wide use of AI can transform many existing business practices fundamentally and pose new risks and challenges we did not experience before. \n\nIn this course, students will learn the necessary technical backgrounds and business insights to become leaders in the AI-transformed economy. We will rely on studies of technological innovation and digitization, as well as real business examples, to build a coherent framework to conceptualize the impact of AI in various settings. Topics to be discussed include what AI technologies are, how AI is creating value by enhancing efficiency and reducing (some) bias in humans, and how organizations overcome challenges related to implementing AI. No prior backgrounds in AI, Machine Learning, or computer programming are assumed.",
