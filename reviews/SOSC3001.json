        "name": "Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach",
        "description": "The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science during the last two decades. The course eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic approach that focuses on specific data sets and distinguishes between data measurement and the production of new facts, and how these new facts complicate our understanding of current social theories. The primary motivation for this course design is to stimulate critical thinking, and to encourage students to question received wisdom.",

I didn't expect to get an A+ on this course, since I don't think our groups' presentations have very high quality based on the contents, and I am not that active in class, only say some of my thoughts and ideas when they came up to my mind, but not every class. <br />So I think the reflection essay is very important because I did put some effort into that essay.",
