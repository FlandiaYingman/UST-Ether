            "comment_content": "Refer to the 2022 Spring Review for Gibson for the detailed breakdown of lecture materials.<br /><br />One point that I dislike about the contents, apart from being quite out-dated, is that the topics are not inter-related from class to class. It sometimes jumps to JS, then jumps back to more on CSS, then more on JS, then HTML forms, then backend, then suddenly more on frontend... A bit hard to follow the logic. But if you can clear up your mind and understand everything, it should be fine with the ireegular order of topics.<br /><br />Also, this course is perhaps one of the few decentralized course in HKUST. Different professors will introduce way different topics. Therefore, suggest you look into other reviews to comapre the detailed contents that each teaches if you think the topics will be one of your concern for enrollment and if you can waitlist into this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Firslty, showing my background, I have taken various &quot;famous&quot; professors in CSE, such as Dave Rossiter, Desmond, Kenneth, DY Leung, etc. This is the first time (and last, ofc.) taking Gibson's class. Maybe I expected too much, or maybe I thought his teaching would be identical to Rossiter's, anyhow, I don't feel his lecture enjoyable. I will say he is an average instructor.<br /><br />The professor did have his heart to teach, and prepare pretty well for each class. However, I fell asleep in almost every lecture. Probably due to the fact that lecture time is TuTh 5-6pm, and in LT-K where the cusions are very nice. The professor tried to make jokes from time to time but I don't think them particularly funny.<br /><br />Also, this is a bit personal, but I just don't like Gibson's intonation. His accent is fine, pronunciation is claer, but his way of presenting linkages between sentences make me hard to concentrate and to digest what every single word that he speaks.<br /><br />After the add-drop, there are about only 10 students in LT-K where the enrollment size is in full capacity 80. This also shows that Gibson may not be as enjoyable as we expect.<br /><br />Even though, he delivers the content and maintains the logistics well. One extra comment is that the TA graded the lab and project really, really slow. It took nearly two months to grade the first lab.",
            "comment_grading": "Labs 3 x 10% (4 choose 3 best)<br />Project 30%<br />Final Exam 40%<br /><br />The four labs are hammer game, jumping game, gem game and chatroom. Project is to develop a web game with real-time connection between two players. (Yes..... I don't know why the professor is so obsessed with games. Anyway, they are fine)<br /><br />Labs are easy. Follow the lab videos and check with the grading scheme to score full.<br /><br />Project is tricky, in the sense that you may think everyone is super good, doing cool games. Indeed, it's not the case. Follow the marking scheme and do every single element and then you will be already top 10%. This is not a game programming course at the end of the day.<br /><br />Final exam: A comp1021 style of final exam, tricky but easy questions. Open book open notes closed internet and closed programming. However, I don't know what's the point of testing us syntax-related stuff and some for-loops or some functions in javascript. Or maybe there is no other things to test at all? Idk.<br /><br />My grade:<br />Labs: Full 30% (means are higher than 95% for each lab, and considering choose 3 out of 4, mean for total lab should around full)<br />Project: 240 out of 250 (mean 230)<br />Final Exam: 93 (mean 68.4)<br /><br />Letter grade: A+<br />Very good indeed. I was expecting an A only.",
            "comment_workload": "Not bad. Labs have videos released where you can just follow all and write 2-3 lines to get full score.<br /><br />The last lab may need to spent more time but is fine. The project is the most heavy part where you need to spend days and nights with your groupmates to work on it.<br /><br />One key tip: Actually not many groups make wonderful games amid Gibson showed many samples at the beginning. Follow all the grading criteria and secure most of the scores before making some cool stuff. Fyr, my game is just an extension of a lab because we did't have enough time to make it nice, yet it fulfills all grading criteria and just lose 10 out of 250 points on &quot;gaming experience&quot;.",

The content is very hands-on and practical, and I'm glad that I finally have a COMP course that teaches me how to code...<br /><br />The course is beginner-friendly and no prerequisite knowledge in web programming is needed. Dave has amended the course topics to remove technologies that are obsolete and include those that are more recent and commonly used. It still does not cover the more advanced technologies such as React, AngularJS and Vue.js, but this is fair enough given the limited time for the course. If you wanna be a full stack developer you probably also need to learn Linux, Apache/Nginx, depending on which stack you would like to specialize in. But I guess you'd need to explore them by yourselves.",
            "comment_teaching": "The COVID-19 pandemic has made us switch to online learning this semester. However, so far I think Dave has done a very good job in delivering course materials and helping us consolidate what we've learned. Dave made &quot;high-efficiency&quot; videos that are clear, concise and suitable for lazy guys like me. He also provided a Zoom session every week and asked a few basic questions to help us revise what we've just learned. Some questions involved tricky points we easily miss out and asking questions is indeed a very nice way to bring them out.<br /><br />PS It was so funny that Dave forgot to escape the characters in his chatroom code example and somebody else in class easily did an XSS hacking during his demo LMAO. Then a message box kept hovering over the web page.",

So a maximum of 28.8% bonus points could be added on top of your overall score. That's a hell lot of points!<br /><br />The midterm was a little online Canvas quiz consisting of 15 multiple choice questions, randomly drawn from a super-set of question database. Everyone would get a slightly different subset of questions. It was conducted quite late towards the end of the Spring semester, in May, so it actually covered most of the lecture materials for the whole semester. Open-book and open Internet. But only Chrome was allowed and of course no messaging. The midterm was easy but tricky, with the mean landing on only 61.7/100. We've got some interesting questions though, like one asking us to go to a web page and check the expiry date of a cookie, and another one asking us to send a HEAD HTTP request and check the last modified date of an HTML file. This would only be possible when we have an online midterm like this. But on the other hand Dave also liked to ask &quot;eye test&quot; questions such as spotting a missing speech mark, which I personally think are silly since we now have powerful IDEs that can easily fix all these.<br /><br />Mean = 61.7/100<br />SD = 17.5<br />Max = 92.4<br />Min = 14.2<br /><br />As for the project, 8% of the total score is allocated to the project proposal. As soon as you've written something intelligible, you should be able to get it. The remaining 32% is for the actual project deliverable. You can either do great in a project with only client-side programming, or do okay-ish in both the client-side and server-side programming to get full score.<br /><br />Mean = 26.6 / 32 (Does not include 0's)<br />SD = 8.4<br /><br />I got 86.67/100 in the midterm, 22.8/28.8 for bonus Zoom questions, 28/32 for the project (got some bugs ‚òπÔ∏è), and full marks in the lab assignments.<br /><br />Final grade: Pass<br />So I dunno what I actually got. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "comment_workload": "The workload mainly lies on the lab assignments and the course project.<br /><br />There were a total of 5 labs, but only lab 2 to lab 4 needed to be submitted.

Mean score were crazily high though, so make sure don't lose any easy marks here.<br /><br />Everything else is simple. but all evil lies in the course project! We can either do it alone or form a group of 2 - 3 people. The topic can either be an extension from the lab (probably can only score an okay-ish mark if we do that) or any other fancy topics we like. At the end we've gotta submit to link to the main page of our website and make a video to introduce what it does / make an appointment to demonstrate to Dave real-time. The difficulty actually depends on the selection of the topic and the group mates. It's still very challenging, however, since the project is indeed assessed in terms of complexity and most of the time the content taught in class is just not enough for a complex project. Specifically the server-side programming such as PHP and Node.js is only taught in brief and there is a lot we have to explore by ourselves if we wanna do a project that includes server-side programming.<br /><br />But overall the workload is lighter than most of the other COMP courses.",

Quite useful and fun since you are doing something hands-on, grades are given on both functionality and gameplay. (Average: 202/250)<br /><br />Final (40%): The only part of this course that isn't good. The final is a 95 minute long, COMP1021 style exam, it is open note however, so just print out everything. Questions range from extremely easy, to just annoying to do since you have to read multiple pages of code to fill in ONE blank, or read 2 pages of a .JSON file to spot ONE missing bracket, what were they thinking? (Average: 66.12/100)<br /><br />I got 9% over mean, and still only a B+, disappointing.",

The last lab is harder since it is more complex, and is split into two parts, while it isn't counted in the grade if you get full marks on the first 3 labs, it's still worth doing in my opinion.<br /><br />The exam is pretty easy to prepare, go through the notes and print them out. Nothing too difficult, wish the course just skipped the exam, and counted the project instead.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the project, like all projects, depends on how good your groupmates are, so there is always some risk involved. I got lucky and had great groupmates, so the workload was good (since I don't have to fix their parts).",

I did it on my own and mine is quite sh__ but I got a full 24%.<br />And exams, they are hard. Although they are open books, we don't have much time to flip and find answers.
