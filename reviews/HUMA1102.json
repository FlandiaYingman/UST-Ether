            "comment_content": "1. Quite disappointed as the course not too focus on listening &quot;classical&quot; music composed by famous composers such as Chopin, Lizst, Mozart, Debussy. Many of these famous composers only cover with 1 or 2 pieces. <br /><br />2. Personally think too much time talking about Drama, Opera. Maybe others like watching dramas, but not me. It would be best if a new course can separate Instrumental music and Drama.<br /><br />3. Nearly 40-50% of the time of the whole course talking about music around the Middle Age, medieval period. To be honest, those music for church chanting are boring. I can hardly distinguish the period of those songs. Those Church songs are really not my cup of tea, many of us sleep during the class.<br /><br />4. A few interesting style of music such as Experimental Music, are covered during 20th centuries. But i am really really unsatisfied as JAZZ, BLUES and not covered at this course.<br /><br />5. The course can really change the way I enjoy music, the background of the composers, the story behind the piece, basic techniques of music, it open a new for me enjoy music.",
            "comment_teaching": "I like Tommasini. I can see he really put effort on this course. He does the&nbsp;&nbsp;preparation well, often provides information more than the powerpoint. Sometimes he would ask us to learn basic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;music techniques, such as singing and clapping. Really relaxing during the course.",

            "comment_content": "- this is my fav course of the semester<br />- history of classical music, spanning across medieval era, renaissance, baroque, classical period, romantic, and 20th century<br />- no music background needed, this is not relevant for the exams<br />- if you're a classical music lover, you're gonna enjoy this course since it is pretty stress free<br />- a few classical pieces (and opera) are introduced, you'll listen to music in class, only those will be included in exams<br />- if anything, it's good to unwind to classical music",
            "comment_teaching": "- prof tommasini is professional and nice<br />- his teaching is great and easy to follow and understand<br />- random attendance is taken through iPRS<br />- you can watch the lecture recap online<br />- (dies irae will play in a 24/7 loop in your head though)",
            "comment_grading": "- only requires hard memorization to ace the exams<br />- 5 online quizzes, one for each topic and 40 MC questions per quiz - you can find quiz answers on quizlet and google<br /><br />- around 80 MC questions and 30 listening MC questions<br />- for listening Qs, you'll need to listen to a short excerpt of a piece, recognize the piece and answer Qs based on it<br />- for this ^ i recommend creating a playlist and basically brainwashing yourself into remembering each song<br />- also do remember the birthplace of the composers<br /><br />- ABSOLUTE grading !!!<br /><br />- midterm : 80/86<br />- final : 125/140<br />- concert report : 13/15<br />- quizzes : all full mark<br /><br />got an A-",
            "comment_workload": "- quizzes for each topic, not too hard as there is a loose time limit<br />- a 600-700 word concert report, you have to go to a classical music concert and write a report relevant to it<br />- as a lot memorization is needed, there will be an added workload, i basically revised after each lecture throughout the semester",

You can also express your own feeling about the pieces when you got nothing to write about anymore. <br />The concert report for this course is quite easy among all music courses, your report could be done without a strong technical analysis but with satisfactory grade.",

Well, after the course, I may have to clarify that students with only a few music knowledge are welcomed, but it is true that they must have to work much harder.<br /><br />In this course, music and operas from the Middle Age to the 20th Century will be introduced. There are a lot of music terms you need to remember. You will listen to masterpieces of famous musicians, and memorize the techniques used in the pieces of work, as the may be asked in the exams.<br /><br />Last but not least, you have to participate in 6 sessions of the Intimacy of Creativity events, including 4 open discussions and 2 concerts. The songs you listen to are all from composers from the 1900s (and some of them are still alive!). In my experience, I have no idea what the composers are trying to show us but I have to try my best to analyze the songs using things that are taught in the lecture, and present it as an essay. Fortunately, the lecturer doesn’t ask for very detailed analysis and it is not difficult to get a good result.",

About 60% are questions that ask you the basic knowledge you have learned from the lectures. And for the remaining 40%, you have to recognize songs from the masterpieces that are introduced to you during the lectures and answer the characteristics such as the names, the composers and the techniques of the songs. For students who are good at music, it may be a piece of cake. But I am pretty sure that most student have to use much more time to memorize the songs.<br /><br />There are 5 MC question online quizzes at all. Each of them asks questions about music in 1-2 periods. They are open book quizzes so most students get high marks.<br /><br />Lecture attendance will be taken 4 times randomly after the add/drop period. And the attendance will be also taken at the 6 sessions of the Intimacy of Creativity. For each additional absence, you will have 1% deducted from your attendance grade. So you are suggested to participate in all events of the course.<br /><br />You have to write a 500-600 words essay about the experience during the Intimacy of Creativity.

You should have a focused thesis statement. Don't worry you can send your thesis statement before that to the professor and he will amend it for you. <br /><br />Studying in spring semester, you have to attend 2 IC concerts which will be held during weekends and 4 IC discussions held during normal school time.

For those having musical instruments/piano background, they will find certain parts (especially those in Classical period) quite easy to handle.<br />The pieces picked by this course sound good in general, but do note that some 20th century music may let you feel annoyed as you may not be able to adapt to those styles.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Tommasini pays a lot of effort and passion in teaching, and you will enjoy in the music played during the class. Sometimes he may also play the piano himself.<br />As you may know, this course requires a concert report. Professor Tommasini will discuss some thesis statements during class to make students familiar of them, and he is willing to read and amend your thesis statement if you send him an email.",

The harder you study, the higher score you will get. The questions in exams may (largely) similar to the questions in self tests or some revision tests. Also, pay some effort in your concert report and do the requirements in the marking rubics may help with your score. I just followed the rubics and I got a decent score in the concert report.<br />Concerning the effort required, I would say getting B range is generally possible if you have gone through the notes, music and self-tests, but getting an A range requires much more effort even if you have some music background.",

The concepts and the examples that Prof gave follows the textbook, so I was able to revise pretty well with it.",
            "comment_teaching": "In his lectures, you will see immediately that Prof. Droscha knows what he's talking about (being the artistic director for Shaw Auditorium definitely helps). He has a sense of humor, often demonstrates the sheet music excerpts with the piano, and teaches us the deep emotional and biographical significance of pieces which we may have heard many times but that we haven't put our minds into.<br /><br />The one weakness he has, apparently, is Canvas. He somehow constantly had problems with the scoring and quiz system, such as setting the deadline of the listening quiz right at the end of lecture time, and we almost always run out of time before the quiz was finished. So for everyone's sanity, don't be afraid to raise any problems you have with Canvas before the lectures. Hope that Prof can make peace with Canvas in future semesters...",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is absolute, as with any other HUMA courses. I won't list the grading scheme here as others have done so already.<br /><br />1. Attendance (10%): used IPRS, taken irregularly<br />2. Quizzes (20%): in-class listening quizzes, online quizzes on lecture contents<br />3. Video Essay (20%): Attend a free concert in UST, then make a 10–12-minute video on one of the pieces. Graded out of 50.<br />4. Midterm (20%): Mostly MCs, and one Q on arranging order of birth of composers<br />5. Final (30%): MCs, Fill-in-the-blank, Short Qs, one essay Q",
            "comment_workload": "Workload depends on what your goals are.<br /><br />Memorization and understanding of the concepts and composers should be fine for B-range.<br /><br />For A ~ A+, most of the workload will be on the video essay. Since I had next to no video-editing experience, and the concert I'm interested in was held one week before the ddl, I had to start playing around with the software, collecting assets and researching before the concert. If you do put in the effort, a 46-50/50 should be easy to get.<br /><br />For the essay Q in the final, knowing some important concepts and sentences for each period and being familiar with the examples in the listening quizzes will definitely help.",

You wouldn't necessarily need to attend class to understand what is going on. There is a textbook, but do not purchase it- it's pretty useless.<br /><br />There is a lot of memorization to do especially because the content is so history heavy. Most of the class however focuses on improving your listening to classical music. To be able to actually &quot;listen&quot; and not just listen. After doing all the practice and attending classes, it's actually pretty easy to do .",

If you're passionate about music, he would be a great mentor. Also very prompt with emails.<br /><br />Also no phones/mobile devices in class. If you want to take notes, do it on paper.",

I was expecting an A- at least, but got a B- instead. <br /><br />The essay (35% of the grade) screwed me over. Even though I'm a native English speaker with pretty good writing skills, he said it was not 'comprehensive enough'. I'm not sure what he was looking for- but I don't care enough about classical music to write an expansive paper on Richard Wagner. <br /><br />Attendance is 15% i think, and although not mandatory, does count towards final percentage. It is through IPRS, so i assume if you had a friend you could tell them to help you out.",

I had to attend 2 concerts of the cosmopolis festival- which was what the essay was written about. <br /><br />But there's no homework, no reading, nothing.

He plays a 20 sec clip of the song and we have to guess the composer, title and year.

The attendance are taken with the iPRS.<br /><br />You could find most of the answers of the online quiz from the lecture notes, or you can copy the question and search it on google. Try to find a website called quizlet on google. In case the question bank of the quiz has no changes, quizlet should have half of the answers for all the online quiz (so sad that I didn't find this out until the 3rd online quiz).<br /><br />For the concert report, try to find some famous musical pieces as the main subject to be discussed in the paper. Since it is much easier to gather more information on internet or some other people's research. Tommasini would help you on your thesis statement. You don't need to worry much that you need to write sth really technical.<br /><br />For the exams, revise more on the lecture notes and don't miss out any details. Try to listen the mentioned music through the course more, able to recognize the musical pieces immediately is very helpful to the exams. About the listening part, the midterm focuses on stuff from Medieval Period to Classical Period, while the finals focuses on Romantic Period to 20th Century.",

Contemporary Art music is the most difficult part since you will barely recognize any of them. <br />Overall, very organised content and well structured ppt.

As long as you attend the lectures and concerts, you get easy 10% for attendance. Online quizzes are open-book, so it's easy to get full 10%, and it helps you to practice for your midterm and finals. And as long as you study the contents properly you can get decent scores in the exams. The most tricky one is the concert report. To give some tips, it's really important to formulate a good thesis statement, which you can ask the professor to review it for you. In addition, use a lot of musical vocabularies learnt to aim for higher scores.",

To get A+, you need to obtain at least 98% score. For A, it's 92-98%. The grading very harsh and since it's absolute, you can't rely on low average to help you out.",
            "comment_workload": "Very light workload. You need to do 5 quizzes. The first two are given 24 hours to complete while the rest are given 2 hours. It's more than enough to try to complete it without looking and then checking back with the notes. The concert report might be harder, but it's only 600 words and you'll get a high score for it if you know how to use the musical terms taught in the course.",

You don't have to have musical background or anything, but it would make the lecture sound more familiar if you have some.<br /><br />The overall content of the lecture was okay for me in terms of the variety of music and music-related knowledge that I did not know before. However, I am not sure if I enjoyed listening to those, especially when I was preparing for the exams since as exam periods approach, the amount of stuff that you have to memorize pile up and eventually become a burden.

            "comment_content": "As mentioned by all previous review.<br />The content seems unchanged comparing with the previous semesters and this semester.<br />Before mid-term you will study music from medieval period to classical period.<br />And after mid-term you will study something from romantic period to 20th century.<br />You can use google to find all of the ppt and you can read them through before you register this course.",

            "comment_grading": "Very tough.<br /><br />What make this course horrible is that you have to remember all the songs that have been taught in that period and the listening part occupy nearly half of the questions of both exams.<br /><br />For example, in my mid-term there is 100 questions and 40 of them are the listening. You have to listen to 10 clips and answer those questions.<br />And in the final there is 150 questions and you have 80 listening questions, which means that you have to listening and recognise 16 songs.<br /><br />My point of view (You can of coz disagree and just ignore, just for reference)<br />I don't think this is something so-called &quot;enjoyment of music&quot;. <br />This course should be named as &quot;Remembering music&quot;.<br />Even if you work hard and study those characteristics of those periods, you can get a D grade. Yes a D grade. That's what I got as I find it quiet hard to remember all the music, some of them are 1h long and they just take out 1 min of that song and ask you what is that song. Where did the composer born? <br />If you are confident and you think you have time to remember all those songs, you are of course welcome to take this course.<br />Otherwise, think twice before taking this &quot;Remembering of Music&quot;.<br /><br />And one more thing: Just pray for that they will not put the final exam of this course with another course together. I had my PHYS1114 final and HUMA1102 final in just one day, exam by exam!!And both of them need hard-work.",

            "comment_content": "This course talks about the 4 periods in classical music which are Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century periods. The professor will start with music from the Dark Ages first, and it's better if you understand that since he'll use this period for references in the future. <br /><br />He'll talk about the composers, how an excerpt of a piece of classical music differs from or resonates with another, and how to spot the differences so we can know what piece is from which period. The professor will repeat those three anyways, so if you attend the lectures and really listen then you'll be able to get it. <br /><br />He posts lecture videos, too, so if you were absent from a class you could just go on Canvas and then watch the video from there, although he sometimes uses iPRS to take attendance without prior notice so you have to be on the lookout for that.",
            "comment_teaching": "He's easy to understand, comprehensive, and doesn't stray away from the bullet points in his ppt files. Even if you don't listen to his lectures, you can still study from ppt files so there's no way you'll flunk this course.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading's absolute, but the quizzes were easy and if you really go through the ppt files and memorise the songs he talked about in his lectures, Midterm and Final are gonna be easy as well.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was pretty light since he gave 1 online quiz after 3 or 4 lectures. All the quizzes consisted of 40 MCQ and were timed, except for the first two. Some of the quizzes' questions were also included in Midterm's and Final's exams, and the good thing is that we can still review the quizzes even after we submitted them. <br /><br />Also, we were required to attend a classical concert and submit a 500 to 600-word report about it alongside the ticket stub. I think if you already have basics in classical music, it'll be easier for you to write the report but you can still go through all his lecture files and then incorporate those music-related phrases into your report.",

            "comment_teaching": "Professor Tommasini prepares class thoroughly and often starts lesson by repeating some content from the previous lesson. As long as you pay attention in class and try to memorise alongside his teaching (and not forget things), the content shouldn't be too difficult to study.<br /><br />(he always shhhhes people though, which I hated a lot because sometimes I don't even hear people talk but he shhhhes)",
            "comment_grading": "The course is absolute grading and quite harsh. However since I am good at memorisation, the course was okay for me as I just stuffed everything into my brain. (quite tough though since there is quite a lot of things to remember)<br /><br />- 1 midterm [25%]<br />- 5 online quizzes (open book quiz, quiz 1-2: 24 hours to do; quiz 3-5: 2 hours to do) [10%]<br />- 1 final exam [40%]<br />- 1 concert report (500 words) [15%]<br />- 10 random iPRS [10%]<br />*****all exams and quizzes are MCs<br /><br />The midterm exam covered Medieval, Baroque and Classical periods. The final exam is non-cumulative (decided later by the professor) covered Romantic and 21st Century periods.<br /><br />Concert report was pretty tough. Professor Tommasini showed examples of thesis statements and allowed us to send it to him by email and he gave us advices. Doesn't help with writing the report though...<br /><br />Quiz was easy, people basically scored full mark.<br /><br />I attended all iPRS, got almost full marks for all of my quizzes, got 96/100 for midterm, 137/150 for finals and 13.5/15 for concert report. Finally got an A.",
            "comment_workload": "Not that much, as there were only 5 quizzes evenly distributed throughout the whole semester. The concert report was tough, but as long as you don't be a deadline fighter and listen to a concert that is very close to the deadline, 500 words shouldn't be too hard to cram.",

These musical eras only cover a small part of the syllabus. The main focus is on the common-practice period, which means the Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods. 20th Century music also possesses a significant part but the instructor may not go in depth. <br /><br />The lecture slides introduce the history and culture of different musical periods and explain the characteristics of the compositions in the corresponding eras. A few examples of composers and their works will then be cited.<br /><br />Some musical theories, such as circle of fifths are included as well. Students have to be familiar with the manipulation of musical keys such as parallel and relative major/minor and dominant keys.<br /><br />The exams are likely to be precise and goes into details like the composers' nationality and the definition of musical terms.",

However, there are still some questions on the slides that are answered neither on the slides or in the lectures. Another problem is the repetition of content. The instructor copies the slides that he has not covered onto the next slide. But overall the presentation is quite comprehensible.<br /><br />The instructor emphasizes a lot on the concert report and he sometimes spend 1/3 of the lecture to talk about the details. However, the way he delivers the messages is outstanding. It will not be very hard for students without musical background to understand. His enthusiasm and attitude towards music is conspicuous.<br /><br />Students must attend the Intimacy of Creativity Concerts as well as the discussion sessions but not everyone finds it interesting.

The exams consist of tons of questions about every detail covered in the syllabus and it requires much effort and time to study for a good grade.<br /><br />The online quizzes are open-book tests so most of the students get very high percentages.<br /><br />The grading of the concert report is quite ambiguous and opaque.

For middle, medieval and renaissance periods, the learning materials are relatively less than the Baroque period's and onwards. Remember to listen to the works discussed in the lecture and memorise the characteristics related to these works. The lecture notes will be released before each lecture.<br />PRS for taking attendance will be done in 10 of all lecture throughout the semester randomly. Bear in mind that sometimes PRS will be taken at the end of the lecture so for those who leave the lecture early will lose some marks in attendance.<br />The most tricky thing for this course is the concert report which should be handed in in the last lecture. You have to write a report after attending a concert and use musical theories taught in the lecture to appreciate the concert.",

Small, random details are asked very often so do go through every bit of the lecture notes.<br /><br />The GOOD news would be exams are NOT cumulative. Most stuff covered in the midterm would not appear in the final except those really basic and crucial one.<br /><br />WARNING:<br />Do not leave your concert report til the very end, you will probably screw it up like I did (score = mean).

You can send your thesis statement to the professor and ask if the direction is correct or not. This concert report requires precise and concise language and most importantly, the application of course concepts. There are many concerts held by the HKUST Music Alive regularly and they are free of charge. Classical concerts held by other organizations are also allowed but you have to ask the TA whether they are suitable or not.<br /><br />Midterm Exam 25%<br />It consists of 90 MCs but the time given is one hour only. The midterm is divided into part 1 and 2. Part 1 consists of theory questions while part 2 are listening questions. Each listening sample will be played twice. However, you have to be really familiar with the ppt as time is really tight in the midterm. Try to get familiar with the listening samples earlier as you won't be able to log in to the music library server before the midterm if too many students have already logged in.<br /><br />Final Exam 40%<br />The format is the same as the midterm exam except it is longer and non-cumulative. A Youtube playlist consisting the listening samples will be given before the exam. You can loop the playlist. I think it is easier to identify the listening samples in the Final exam than the midterm but there are many more pieces.<br /><br />Attendance 10%<br />Attendance is taken by PRS randomly in classes but the professor allows students to write their names on a piece of paper at the end of the lesson if you have forgotten to bring it.<br /><br />Online Self-tests 10%<br />There are 5 self- tests on Canvas. It only counts participation but not accuracy. Some exam questions are taken from the self- tests so they are good revision materials.",
