Students will convert their concepts that were created using sketches or 3D design software to tangible prototypes. Quick prototyping using various materials will provide hands-on experience. The course will also provide knowledge on various 3D prototyping technologies so that students can explore the most suitable means to generate functional and aesthetically pleasing prototypes. Hands-on experience with assembly to generate complete prototypes will be emphasized.",

Each weekly lecture is centred around technology or prototyping topics, and the lab session afterwards is supposed to offer students a hands-on experience with that technology. As this semester is held online, most lab sessions are scrapped and replaced with more presentations by the TA, Terrence. There will be a short canvas quiz afterwards for some of the advanced topics in the courses to test your knowledge.<br /><br />The project topic for this semester is sterilization robots. Each team has to design and prototype a robot that can sterilize or clean an environment.",
            "comment_teaching": "The content taught by professor Mitch Li is very interesting in it offers excellent insight into the prototyping process from a designer's standpoint. However, you will encounter that the students in the course have diverse backgrounds in prototyping and hands-on making stuff. Some students may already know all the course contents, like how to do 3d printing/ laser cutting/ coding and embedded system design, while others have never touched upon this technology. <br /><br />In the first few weeks, each team need to propose a design as the goal for the course to prototype throughout the semester. But you don't need to worry about things getting out of hand as most teams will simplify their design throughout the semester, and there are a lot of PG TAs to help you.",
