        "name": "Max Weber, China, and the West",
        "description": "This course examines what might be called \"the Weber question\", namely, how, why, when, and to what extent did the West steal a march on the rest of the world and establish what has come to be seen as the foundations of modernity? This was Max Weber's question, posed most powerfully and succinctly in his classic work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. We will engage in a close reading of the Protestant Ethic and related texts to discern Weber's argument. We will then evaluate his findings in the light of recent scholarship. Weber elaborated and tested his hypothesis concerning the role of Protestantism by examining a number of other world religions and ethical systems. We will concentrate on one of these, his study The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism. We will study this closely, comparing it with The Protestant Ethic, and seeing how far Weber was able to prove his case about the uniqueness of Protestantism. Instructor's approval is required for enrolling in the course.",
