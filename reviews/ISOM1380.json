        "description": "This course describes the development of technology and innovation from social and business perspectives.  It covers the technology side of innovations, how an invention can be developed into a successful commercial product, the role of innovation in society and how innovations are created from a socioeconomic perspective.  It highlights that successful development and adoption of innovative products relies not only on the technology itself but also a complex process that is subject to the impact of cultural, political, economic and managerial factors.",

IE. if the answer why Apple falls is because of gravity, TA wouldn't accept that Apple falls because of Earth's pulling force.

If you can go through the lecture slides a few times a day or two before the exam, you shouldn't have much problem getting above 90%.

The content includes why we need to have innovation, examples about innovations, how to conduct innovations, qualifications that need to conduct an innovation, timing, some models and analysis.<br /><br />Easy to learn, since you don't need to remember anything at all, the power points are full of examples which you don't need to memorize at all.<br /><br />Actually, the professor only taught a few key words, like knowledge, timing that common sense things, that's why a lot of people want to take this course, since the content is very very easy. You can just go to the lecture and listen some interesting stories.",

He gives a lot of examples for students to think of, like mobile phones, IBM, Microsoft etc. He also talks a lot of example like his experiences and his life in HK etc.<br /><br />His power-points are interesting too. Sometimes, he puts some Chinese wordings in his power-points like 知己知彼，百戰不殆. As I said before, the professor always asks me questions. Once he asked me to teach him Cantonese in some Chinese Wordings. HAHA, he learnt very fast and pronounced it clearly and accurately.<br /><br />Sometimes, there is some bad words in his speaking which makes us laugh, such as axxholes, fxxking etc. LMAO",

I talked to him for several times, he told me that everyone can get 90 or above out of 100 marks in the final exam. And the presentation, he did not give any marks during the presentations, he just listened how the students introduce the topic and present. He said everyone did as well as he thought.<br /><br />BTW, he divided us into twelve groups and there were seven to eight people in a group. We can choose some people to give the presentation but not necessary for all the group-mates to do the presentation. This is a good way for you to work as a group.",

I scored quite high marks for midterm (&gt;1 or 1.5 SD higher than mean) , but I did not perform too well in the final (&gt;0.5 SD higher than mean). My project was 28/30.

The group works are 2 ppt presentations, tbh, the workload of this summer class is a little bit heavy, but they are easy to deal with, no worries. Just try your best and most of the groups get good grades.<br /><br />For the final exam, I strongly recommend you spend some time revising the content of the course, as you only have roughly 4 weeks of lectures.

Highly dependent on your groupmates abilities on presenting and making powerpoints.<br /><br />Group Assignment (Case analysis) (10%): In the same group, make a 15 page long powerpoint analyzing/summarizing a paper regarding innovation in Siemens, the paper is quite long, but not too difficult to read, again this is highly dependent on your groupmates abilities.<br /><br />Individual Assignment (5%): Summarize a long essay about disruptive products, the essay is quite long and boring, however summarizing it is not particularly hard.<br /><br />Peer Evaluation (20%): Rate your groupmates with IPeer! Since this is worth 20% of the grade its clear you MUST pay effort in the groupwork, otherwise you will pay.<br /><br />Class Attendance (5%): Just attend the lectures.<br /><br />As you can see the groupwork is a huge part of the course, and the groups are assigned RANDOMLY, but you are bound to get a few groupmates from the business school, who can help a lot with the presentation! However as with all group projects there is an element of luck involved. <br /><br />No grades were released, very nontransparent grading.

Assuming you don't have any freeriders, you most likely just need to make a few pages of powerpoints throughout the course, which for 3 credits is amazing.",

The group mates I spoke to after the final agreed with me that it was not too difficult. If you look over the slides and listen to the lectures, the MCs and T/Fs should be easy for the most part.
