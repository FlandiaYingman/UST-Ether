        "description": "This course provides a detailed foundation in chemical oceanography, which is an essential interdisciplinary component of understanding ocean processes across a multitude of different spatial and temporal scales. It will examine the ocean as a chemical system in which the inputs, outputs, and internal cycling of the elements determine their concentrations and distributions. It will also cover chemical processes that are essential in biological systems, control the geology of the planet, and provide key tracers for understanding past, present and future ocean conditions.",
