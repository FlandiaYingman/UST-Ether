        "description": "This course gives a comprehensive introduction to aerial robots. The goal of this course is to expose students to relevant mathematical foundations and algorithms, and train them to develop real-time software modules for aerial robotic systems. Topics to be covered include rigid-body dynamics, system modeling, control, trajectory planning, sensor fusion, and vision-based state estimation. Students will complete a series of projects that combine into an aerial robot that is capable of vision-based autonomous indoor navigation.",
