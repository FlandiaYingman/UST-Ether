Hong Kong has been critical to the GBA's development and the progress of Hong Kong and the region will continue to be intertwined. This course invites students to explore the strengths and weaknesses of individual cities of the GBA and to understand the cultural, economic, political and urban forces that link the cities together and connect the region to the world. Throughout the course we compare the evolution the GBA to other megacity regions in order to better understand the challenges the region faces and to gauge the region's progress.",
