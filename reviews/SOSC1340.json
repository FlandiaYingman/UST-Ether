        "description": "China-US Relations is about interactions between the world's two most important countries. The more than two centuries' long history of the relationship is first elaborated. Consideration is then given to the key perennial conflictive issues on which conflict between China and the US, including economic issues, Taiwan, Tibet, human rights and arms-related questions. Many other areas of conflict and cooperation are also a focus of discussion, especially through student research papers and presentations. The analysis of China-US relations is carried out in the context of the effects the relationship has on the rest of the world.",

Also his teaching pace is appropriate, as he will pause a little whenever he finishes a small part.",

He claims that those who choose to write a paper usually get a higher grade than those who don't (which he mentions it in all courses he teach).<br />I chose only taking the exams and I got a B-, which a friend of mine who wrote a paper got a B. It is really easy for you to get a high grade, just revise well and pay attention to what he said in class.",

If you choose to take the two MC exams only, what you need to do is just revise all ppts as well as the points he emphasised in class. There are also some reading materials and tutorials, which is also voluntary, but they are helpful for those who are interested in specific topics or preparing for exams.",
