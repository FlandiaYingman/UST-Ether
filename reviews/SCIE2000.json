        "description": "Using developments in human being's concepts on space, time and motion as examples, this course intends to inspire students to appreciate how abstract scientific/ mathematical concepts are essential to our understanding of space-time and how the abstract formulation has deepened our understanding in the nature of space-time itself. The course starts by introducing the mathematical tools of geometry, followed by Newton's concept of space-time and Laws of motions. The role of (space-time) symmetry is then used to understand the origin of conservation laws in mechanical motion and the discovery of the Law of gravity. The necessity to relax the idea of rigid space-time is then introduced through the discovery of electromagnetic wave and the course will discuss how this and the principle of symmetry have led to Einstein's discovery of special relativity. The course ends with an introduction to Einstein's general relativity and Riemannian geometry.",

            "comment_content": "當年大家都叫呢科做「大佬」，而事實上都好少人take，少於30人。論content，其實SCIE2000真係好有趣，由Newton's Law開始，佢會不斷挑戰你故有既思想，例如會質疑: 到底&quot;Force&quot;既定義係乜野? 點解F一定係等於ma而唔係其他expression e.g. F = ma+bv? 之後會講Kepler's Law，然後開始用Galilean Invariance黎引入Special Relativity，說明點解為左constant of light speed，時間一定要同空間混合埋一齊考慮。<br /><br />最後會講少少General Relativity同Quantum Mechanics，呢兩part都係就咁講，無數學。<br /><br />好多人一開始都會俾d數學嚇親，其實我自己都係，連M2都冇讀過，但事實證明，去到後期，講d比較抽象既relativity時候，concept比起math更艱難。<br /><br />總括黎講，我覺得對呢類topic有興趣既同學絕對可以一試，唔好怕難，呢個course本來就係為左挑戰自己。",
            "comment_teaching": "TK講野好soft，聽書既時候好似聽緊佢講故事，會帶你重新思考一次physics既fundamentals。<br />住course都冇text book用，只有lecture notes同supplementary notes。",
            "comment_grading": "mid tern同final既題目都唔難，如上面所說，對數學要求一d都唔高，要諗到個answer，靠既係你既concept、logic同想像力; 考試open book。完sem時有個佔10%，5分鐘既presentation，題目係「整個course你覺得最難明白的東西」，好有意思，論grading其實你有盡力就會俾高分，但係佢出呢個present既原意，係指出一個道理: The higher the ability to describe your problem, the higher the chance you can solve the problem.",
            "comment_workload": "workload大唔大係睇你領悟力有幾高，我個人黎講，就花左極多時間去理解time dilation同space contraction。",

            "comment_content": "I can hardly remember what was being taught, but it started with Newton's three laws, and somehow went into gravity, relativity, time dilation, Lorenz transformation (???), and etc... I think my confusion should serve as a warning that unless you're very into theoretical physics, you probably shouldn't take it. (Business student here - only relying on the very little physics and M2 learnt while in high school)",
            "comment_teaching": "Back then it was Prof Ng who taught us (can't pick the name out from the instructor part - has he retired or what???).&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quite hilarious at times... other than that, admittedly I was trying very hard to understand what he was saying. In general I think he spoke quite clearly, and that should be good.",
            "comment_grading": "Given that I only understood one out of all the lectures in the semester, the fact that I got above mean in the midterm, and a B range score in the end really surprised me.<br />Does it mean it gives good grades? Only if you're able to tackle all of the course materials, and are willing to spend a lot fo time on it.<br />Alternatively, get some buddies with you and study together - and get help together if you need help.",
            "comment_workload": "Some homework, one take-home midterm and one final exam - not a lot of load apparently, but if you're not one of the chosen geniuses then it's gonna be huge work for you, especially if you once thought this is just a common core course and so it shouldn't be too hard...<br />(sigh)",
