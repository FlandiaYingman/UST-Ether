        "description": "The global environment will continue to degrade until there are significant changes in business practices and consumer behavior. In this course we are going to explore how environmental forces are creating threats and opportunities for business. We will look at \"best practices\" of numerous companies in different industries and from different perspectives. We explore why current destructive business practices are so \"sticky\" and resistant to change. We will look into the future and ask, even if business changes its practices, will it be enough? You don't have to be an environmentalist or tree-hugger to benefit from this course. Understanding where, when and how change is occurring is useful for understanding investment decisions, crisis mitigation, product development, marketing and long-term profitability. It is possible to be engaged in business and also do something positive for the planet. Looking ahead and asking how things will look in the future is a useful mindset to cultivate.",
