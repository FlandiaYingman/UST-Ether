If you do not like calculations, DO NOT choose this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Marshal's teaching is always good. He makes the class interactive by telling jokes of himself. Attendance is not required, but he also recognizes you if you attend the class frequently. If he can recognize you, you will get 5% class performance, otherwise you lose 5%. He will ask your English name after add drop period. He also sometimes gives us some snacks such as chocolates and dried strawberries (his product). <br />Anything you do not understand just send him an email, including homework. He will reply you promptly.",

There are lots of calculations, which requires you to understand the formula very well. Try to work hard in the final exam because most people have high marks in homework and quizzes.<br />Workload is high compared to LIFS courses, but Marshal gives generous A range.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is a bit high, there are have 5 quizzes (exclude the lowest score), 4 homework, 2 group project (4 people) and 1 final exam. The group project requires you to use a bioreactor to ferment something. You can ferment anything as long as you do fermentation. You do not need to purify the products. You also need to do a literature review to introduce a fermentation product and make a video and 800 words essay. Finally, attend a Q&amp;A session. During the Q&amp;A session, you can have some snacks and drinks.",
