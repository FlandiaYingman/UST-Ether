            "comment_content": "The course taught the preliminary aircraft design. Aircraft design is indeed a very complex and time-consuming process, so the course only covered the first steps using first-order estimation methods.<br /><br />Contents:<br />1. Course introduction<br />2. Aircraft design overview<br />3. Preliminary weight estimation<br />4. Preliminary sizing<br />5. Aircraft configuration<br />6. Fuselage layout<br />7. Preliminary wing design<br />8. Preliminary weight balance<br />9. Stability analysis, empennage design (by Mr. Anthony Hays)<br />10. Landing gear design<br />11. Structures<br />12. Propulsion<br />13. Aerodynamic refinements<br />14. Cost analysis<br />15. Optimization and higher-order analysis<br /><br />The course also placed strong emphasis on coding. Before taking MECH3620 one should have learnt the basics of Julia programming language in MECH3670. The course's tutorials would teach the full extent of Aerofuse, a HKUST developed first-order aircraft design analysis module.<br /><br />To be honest, these first-order skills might not be that useful in real-life aircraft manufacturing industry unless you are posted to preliminary design departments (Professor Redonnet said Airbus indeed had a group of engineers work on using low-fidelity first-order analysis to get a first glance). However, if you intend to pursue a FYDP related to aircraft design (there is 2 for this year), the course's contents are definitely relevant and useful.",
            "comment_teaching": "You should have probably known Professor Rhea Liem well. She's responsible for teaching the aerospace engineering curriculum's introduction (i.e. MECH1907) and the final course. Before the course, she asked us some concerns related to this course, and provided useful feedback/appropriate modifications in response to our concerns. She also vowed to create a more democratic course, in which she would let us to decide whether we would pay attention to some supplementary contents and videos or leave early. For more comments on Professor Liem, one can seem my review on MECH1907:<br /><br />https://ust.space/review/MECH1907/view/hGz5chN5llYR7I1nC4svW240V97d01Mr<br /><br />For the part of stability analysis and empennage design, Mr. Anthony Hays was in charge of the lectures. He was a British engineer who emigrated to and worked in the United States. As a native speaker his English was very clear, albeit he spoke a little fast. He may also held some academic conferences and took consultation in HKUST (this year it was hydrogen-propelled aircraft), in which his contents and advice may be useful to unconventional designs.<br /><br />James Mingzhi Shihua, Aobo Yang and Arjit Seth were the course's TAs. The previous two were responsible for most weekly tutorials, while Arjit was responsible for introducing us to Julia coding and Aerofuse. All of them were helpful and responded to enquiries timely. As Aerofuse is a developing programming module, there could be some bugs within it. You are strongly encouraged to report irregularities when something went wrong despite double-checking!",
            "comment_grading": "*Class participation: 5%<br />*Individual coding assignment: 10% (76%, mean 86.32%)<br />*Quizzes (x2): Each 5%<br />**(Quiz 1: 90%, mean 78.82%)<br />**(Quiz 2: 76.67%, mean 90.2%)<br />*Independent self study: 25% (91%, mean 83.02%)<br />*Aircraft design project: 50%<br />**Midterm review: 10% (90%, mean 83.41%)<br />**Final report and presentation: 40% (Never released per MAE practice)<br /><br />Professor Liem did count on class participation, though it was not by roll calling. Questions asked in lectures and (especially) during midterm and final presentations were counted.<br /><br />The coding assignment was similar to typical COMP course assignments by filling codes in the empty spaces of a Julia notebook file. The quizzes were similar to what one had experienced in MECH1907, in which multiple choice conceptual questions without requiring calculation was asked. They were take-home open-book quizzes, and we were given a week to finish them. Apparently I didn't excel that much in terms of them, but the nevertheless cost 20%.<br /><br />The independent self study required student to either write an essay or record a video on an aircraft design or aviation/aerospace industry-related topic. Before we started off with them, Professor Liem would review and comment on our proposed topics. I wrote about a baka (⑨) bomb amidst the ongoing Ukrainian war and received a high score.<br /><br />One can therefore see how important is your aircraft design project. In this semester we were required to design a mid-range business jet (not sure whether the topic would change in the future). The midterm review was significantly laxer than the final review, as it was intended to be a feedback session.<br /><br />At the end I get an A for this course, which seems to be proportional to the course's great workload.",
            "comment_workload": "Before mid-March, the project workload of MECH3620 wasn't that high apart with some assignments and quizzes, as we were not taught with more course contents yet. Once that turning point was passed, you would be facing with the workload of midterm review, independent self study, concurrent with the workload from other courses (most notoriously MECH3690).<br /><br />Professor Liem told us to start working on the independent self study as soon as she approved your topic. This is indeed correct, as the first wave of lab reports in MECH3690 struck at approximately early March. While not much technical analysis can be done, establishing your topic's factual background and source analysis are important when you start the analysis later.<br /><br />During the latter stage of the course, you would be working on more programming analysis. It was also the time when your group would prepare for Powerpoint for presentation. Depending on which part you did, running programs (especially true for optimization) could often be time-consuming, and a high-performance laptop is definitely a good companion. You should also note that the provided MADE collaborative server is a potato server that frequently crashed, so make sure you do frequent backups (a group lost all of their server files and backup files stored on the server), and avoid running large programs on the server.<br /><br />Professor Liem provided a timetable listing out the suggested deadlines for each part of design, try your best to stick with it for time management.",

On top of that, she'll also introduce some nice aircrafts that show how design factors to much of the properties of the aircraft (Blackbird, U2, F117).<br /><br />The project is largely related to the content she teaches, but it is the TA who introduces how can we implement code into the design process.",

If you took 1907, she'll likely remember you by name. She's also very responsive after class and by email. <br /><br />For 3 of the lectures, she has a guest lecture through zoom, Tony Hays a very-experienced aircraft engineer in the design field. He even introduced a bit about his career journey.

But in the end I got B+. Rhea knew my group situation and has group peer review, so I guess the grade I got is quite optimistic",
            "comment_workload": "Very high concerning the group project, which is essentially designing your own scenic aircraft. Hope you have groupmate who knows aircrafts really well, or else the guessing game is going to be much more painful. <br /><br />Based on the aircraft you want to design, the more unusual the concept is, the more research you need to do. I know a group did an electric aircraft, they did a ton of research already during the beginning of the semester because it is a bit out of AE students's scope from what we've learnt so far. <br /><br />Moreover Rhea makes us do progress update reports so that we won't have to do last-minute work as much. Plus she could give some feedback if there's some concerning issues about our report. But this is what makes it very heavy, as I only met my groupmates online, it's difficult to find a time to discuss and make sure everyone does their work. Each progress reports is due about 2-3 weeks then the next one is up. <br /><br />I've got terrible groupmates, I mean they don't do anything, me and 1 other guy managed to finish most of the work. So obviously for me it was very heavy as my groupmates 'stopped working' since early in the semester.<br /><br />Individual assignments and term paper was relatively simple and easy to do, just make sure the formatting is alright for the term paper. The individual term paper is any topic of our choice that is closely related to aircraft design. Rhea will require a simple topic proposal before she approves, then we can start writing. We got about 1.5 month to finish it.",
