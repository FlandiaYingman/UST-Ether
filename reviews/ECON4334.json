            "comment_teaching": "Professor Cook did not look particularly prepared for classes which can be reflected by his articulation during his teaching, and he didn't manage to create a vivid learning environment due to his monotone in the 9am class. He is not the enthusiastic teacher that you are looking for, but he is definitely more than willing to answer students' question during and after classes.<br /><br />His slides was poorly designed and disorganised, you could find errors in his slides occassionally. Graphs and data in his slides are not important at all, but make sure you can grasp the key ideas behind them, like trend of a graph, as they will be tested during exam.",
            "comment_grading": "His grading is better than I expected, just like other economics professors. Due to the special arrangement this semester, grade a student receive depended on whichever mid-term+hw or final+hw letter grade is better out of the two letter grade. I got +0.95 s.d. for my midterm and nearly full mark for hw. No result released for final, which I think I did pretty poorly, therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe midterm+hw will be the combination that decides my final grade. Professor claimed that he would apply absolute grading in this course. Considering the fact that I didnt do a expectional job in my midterm, <br />receiving an A is an &quot;overrated&quot; grade for me, still, I would like to thank Professor for his generosity.",
            "comment_workload": "Really low. Firstly, I really don't think students have to attend classes at all since his slides included everything even though it is disorganised. Everything he taught during the class was simply repeating whatever has been stated in the slides. Secondly, there were 4 homeworks throughout the courses and each took me about 2 hours at max if attempted seriously, and the TA was quite lenient in marking our work, therefore, not much time needed for checking and polishing our answers.",

The objective is to derive a robust conclusion which can be applied to relatively complicated real life situations.",

Though, Professor Zhu is willing to slow down to answer whatever questions you might possibly have. <br /><br />During class, he mainly goes through the PowerPoint slides, which are mainly the summary of detailed notes he uploads on Canvas. To be honest, merely relying on classes to fully grasp the content can be really challenging, mainly due to the nature of this course; there are&nbsp;&nbsp;A LOT of variables that you can easily lose track of even if you zoned out for a short time. The models require quite a lot of logics (not necessarily math-related), hence I highly recommend you to read through the notes before class, so you are not as lost (it is normal to be lost in this class).<br /><br />The pace of his class can be fast sometimes, BUT his vocal pace is REALLY slow, which does give you time to catch up on the content but also rid you of the will to listen. <br /><br />If you are expecting a fun, interactive class full of discussions, you might want to think twice. If you are not really interested in the course topics in the first place, this course could be A LOT of work for very LITTLE fun.

The second part is about the asymmetric information and moral hazard which contributes to the significance of financial intermediation. The last part is about monetary policy, foreign exchange rate and a little content about fiscal policy.<br />Throughout the course, mathematical models and derivations are the main roles so do not miss even one class otherwise you are hard to keep up with it. As long as you have a full understanding about the models it's easy to get a high grade,<br />The assignments only cover what we learn from class and no other content will be covered.<br />What it does not cover is those about financial aspects, which may be important to students apart from economics program.",
