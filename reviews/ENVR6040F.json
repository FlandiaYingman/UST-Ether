        "description": "Technology often creates the differentiation for a product or offering in the market place. In this course, we look into how technology management is done in corporations and startups. (Aspects of entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship will be explored.) The overall process of developing differentiated products or offerings is presented and assessed. The tie to the marketplace is discussed through development of the business plan for the technical offering. Also, we will cover the human aspects of R&D work and how best to protect intellectual properties. Marketing and promotion practices will also be explored. Specifically for environmental techniques, we look into life cycle analysis (LCA) and opportunities arising from the ever increasing focus on the environment. We will look at different cases for successful environmental-related offerings, some based on the instructorâ€™s past experience.",
