        "description": "Satellite remote sensing technique measures geophysical parameters from the electromagnetic energy emitted or reflected from the earth, and can be used to estimate earth surface characteristics, atmospheric compositions and profiles, and meteorological processes. This course provides a brief overview of the fundamental essentials to understand the remote sensing process, satellite data products, and their applications in atmosphere, land, and ocean.",

I think it could be regarded as an introductory course for remote sensing even though I am only an UG student.<br />I think prof. should consider incorporating more interesting topic like recent research, rather than a lot of boring concepts. After this class, I feel I got nothing helpful.",

You search a lot, but you feel all the homework cannot actually train your academic or scientific ability. It is frustrating that we cannot improve ourselves after finishing the homework. The prof obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;should take more effort to design the homework.<br /><br />For the final project it is okay, we design our own research topic.",
