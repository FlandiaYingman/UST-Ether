For example, the professor almost never looked at the camera. <br />Regarding the method of teaching, she explained things in the lecture notes in quite interesting way. I personally think there will not be too much trouble if you skip the lectures, as it is online; there are cloud recordings available after each lecture. <br />Assuming lecture videos are not available, I think you can still handle this course pretty well, but more efforts are needed if you choose to do so. You may need to refer to external resources from the internet for self-study.<br />For tutorials, I think you don't really have to attend it, as all the materials will be uploaded to Canvas.
