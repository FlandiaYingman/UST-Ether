However, the exam paper of final exam is very easy with the use of ChatGPT allowed, you might consider taking this course if you are really interested in biophysics.<br /><br />The number of students enrolled in this course is quite low. For this year, there were only 21 students taking this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Lecture videos of all professors were provided, so you don't have to attend the lecture in person.<br /><br />In addition, there will be a few lab visit sessions during the lecture time slot. Attendance of those lab visit sessions is not required and will not be counted towards your final grade for this year. So, you can skip those lab visits if you wish to.",

This may be due to the fact that there are some biophysics enthusiasts enrolled in this course making the mean and highest score ultra high. <br /><br />Both Midterm and Final were open-book, electronic copies of the lecture notes were allowed, and the use of ChatGPT and other search engines was also allowed. As for the project of writing a 7-9 pages report, you can also use ChatGPT and directly copy and paste the content from there as the submitted project files will not be run through Turnitin for plagiarism check.<br /><br />As for the difficulty of midterm and final, I personally think that the midterm is more difficult than final in terms of the exam questions. However, in terms of the content of coverage, the final exam content to be revised is way harder than that in midterm. In final exam, many questions were of exact wordings with the lecture ppt, so you don't have to worry about its challenging content.",

He would sometimes diverge out to talk about different topics which are not related to the notes at all but most of them would not be examined if he did not mention it in the review session. The professor is super nice, so you could ask loads of questions after class.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is quite good as the professor said 'He would like to take advantage of small class and gives more A and B range.' Mean is like 72% for two midterms but no mean was shown for final. Matching and short-answer question for first mid-term, occasionally one or two T/ F questions. For second mid-term and exam, there is short-answer question. Remember to go to the review session for papers as suggested by the professor as you could get some marks that sometimes TA would miss one or two points. Remember to go to the lab visit also, it occupies 10% of the course grade if I am correct.<br /><br />The prof claims that he gives out 4-6 A range that there were only 19 students in our class.",
            "comment_workload": "Although prof. ZHU tells us what to memorise before hand, time is needed for memorise the whole syllabus! The exam is not cumulative, however, he may leave some part from the first two midterms to be tested In the final.
