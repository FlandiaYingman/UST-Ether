        "description": "The first part of this course covers the introduction to principles of green engineering and concept of sustainability. The development of green technologies and products has gained importance because of the dramatic effects of anthropogenic climate change. The information technology (IT) ecosystem now represents around 10 per cent of the world's electricity generation. It is critical that IT centers start to use electricity generated by sustainable energies. These include wind and solar energies. Difference between renewable and sustainable energy sources is discussed. Concept of carbon footprint and its calculation is introduced. The second part of this course is designed to help students to understand the important elements of product design.  The focus is management of innovation processes for sustainable products.  Students will learn how to design innovative products through recognizing customer needs; how to determine customer needs; how these needs can be transformed into product specifications; how to generate innovative product ideas; how to evaluate and identify good product ideas; etc.",
