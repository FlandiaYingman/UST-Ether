In lab 4 5, you need to find out some IR peaks to determine the functional group and require to do calculations for finding the coupling constant which is most challenging. <br /><br />For Oral quiz, two questions are easy + 1 question is difficult. Although all questions come from hands-out, you need to remember of the content (lab 1 - 5) is quite difficult. So, you can drop notes and remember the location of the contents after answering the questions which is the most effective way .<br /><br />Overall, the course is good.
