        "description": "In the tropical algebra, the sum of two numbers is their minimum, and the product is their sum. This makes polynomials into piecewise-linear functions and their zero sets into polyhedral complexes. Tropical geometry is a young subject that has undergone rapid development since the beginning of the 21st century. It provides a combinatorial shadow of algebraic geometry and algebraic groups, and reveals new and sometimes unexpected connections among different mathematical branches.",
