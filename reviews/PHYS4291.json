Each presentation lasts for 10 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions from the audience. The grade of your oral presentation will be jointly determined by your supervisor, course instructor(s) and TA/IAs. Late report will be deducted 10% of the report grade per day late until 0% (so if you turn in your report 10 days later, your grade for that report will be 0).",
