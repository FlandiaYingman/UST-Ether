After that, you need to complete a short MC quiz on Canvas within the week. The quizzes consists of 5 questions, and basically revises the key concepts and theories you have learnt from the slides and videos provided.<br /><br />You'll also need to complete a series of discussion questions to be discussed on Friday lectures. Although the discussion questions are unnecessary and do not count anything towards the final grade, volunteering and trying them out in lectures can give you bonus marks in participation.<br /><br />Each student is expected to solve at least 1 - 2 discussion problems throughout the entire course. If nobody can solve a certain problem, it will be added as part of the upcoming homework.<br /><br />Both midterm and final exams are open-book, with questions very similar to homework assignments. You can bring any materials you need for the exam, including the textbook. The professor specified only &quot;traditional&quot; calculators (no programmable or scientific calculators) were allowed. This can work for midterm problems, but for final term you'll need a scientific calculators to solve certain problems such as Bohr's Equation. Bringing a scientific calculator is still highly recommended, because TA allows it. In addition, studying the problems from all editions of the textbook, as well as discussion and exam materials from past semesters, would also aid you in revising the exam.",
