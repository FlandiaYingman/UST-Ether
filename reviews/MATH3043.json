FF's lectures are rewarding. You don't need to worry about the grading cuz the grading is generous...(For 1013 L1...well...depends...⌓‿⌓)<br /><br />FF is a humorous professor and I like his teaching (and peanuts) so much :D. He sometimes proves the same direction for equality and I can never forget he mixed up the direction of Fatou's Lemma in class after saying &quot;come on! primary school stuff~~&quot; and &quot;if you know about the proof, you will still remember which one is which (direction of ≥)&quot; (＾v＾).<br />(Please don't tell FF otherwise my career will GG :P)<br /><br /><br />*** Our TA, Jeff York YE ***<br />We have the same TA in 2043 and I have to emphasize again, he is a GENIUS. I think the majority difference between 2043 and 3043 tutorials is that there are more solvable problems in his tutorial, ​***Relatively _(:з」∠)_***...(I am pretty sure that 3043 tutorial is easier than the 2043 one).<br /><br />Meanwhile, there are some challenging problems that make me feel like my IQ is equivalent to a fungus or phytoplankton. Some tutorial problems are too challenging so hilariously, FF told us a joke like &quot;yeah...should be easier than Jeff's tutorial&quot; in his lecture (≧▽≦).<br /><br />And thx god, FF didn't give us sth. like Jeff's tutorial in his exams (otherwise, at least half of the class will jump mushroom???). But I still encourage you to take a look at the tutorial problems, at least you should know what's going on cuz the results in the tutorial are useful for our homework and exams sometimes.",

            "comment_workload": "Same as 2043 a.e.. l spent most of the time reading proofs and doing homework. Reading the proofs in FF's lecture note is time-consuming because there are too many technical proofs after midterm. (Completeness of L^p space, Egorov's Theorem, Carathéodory extension theorem, Tonelli-Fubini's Theorem, Vitali's Covering Theorem, Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Inequality, Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, Radon-Nikodym’s Theorem).<br /><br />Looking at the proofs is not enough after midterm, you have to really understand the common tricks for some of the proofs, especially for those proofs in product measure (eg. Cross-Section Method, using Monotone Class Theorem, Distributional Method).<br /><br />You may also put less emphasis on the proofs and focus on the application for some of the theorems (eg. Tonelli-Fubini's Theorem, Vitali's 5-Covering Lemma, Area and Coarea Formulae, Radon-Nikodym’s Theorem).<br /><br />FINALLY...I think the most disgusting thing about 3043 is that there is NO intuition behind some of the proofs. Especially for Vitali's Covering and Radon-Nikodym’s Theorem...I am literally speechless...idk how mathematicians can propose such creative and talented proofs...Maybe I have to integrate more 陰德 before enrolling into 3043 (-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩_-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩)<br /><br />EXTRA: Ivan IP's happiness (homework) appeared in our Final exam. :P<br /><br />Good luck :D<br /><br />(點解咁睇唔開讀數?)",

The construction from outer measure (closed cube covering) to Lebesgue measure (open covering) to abstract measure (Caratheodory conditions)<br />2. Nonmeasurable set (Vitali set)<br />3. Littlewood Three Principles (Approximation of measurable set using finitely many disjoint cubes/Lusin theorem/Egorov theorem)<br />4. Construction of Lebesgue integration (simple functions -&gt; functions with Bfs -&gt; Nonnegative -&gt; General -&gt; Complex)<br />5. Interchange of limit and integration (BCT, MCT, LDCT), which are proven through the process of construction above<br />6. L^p Space, L^p norm (inequalities like Jensen inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz, Minkowski, Holder have already covered in homework of previous course)<br />7. Fubini-Tonelli's theorem <br />8. Lebesgue differentiation theorem<br />9. Vitali 3-covering lemma<br />10. Relation between bounded variation, absolute continuity, differentiability of F and integrability of F'<br />(Optional class) Axiom of choice - History and relation to analysis (used in BCT and those constructions involving equivalence class, and construction of Vitali 5-covering)<br /><br />and he surprisingly included part of chapter 4 (Hilbert space) which echoes some contents in 2131. I checked that the remaining untaught part of this chapter is perfectly those involving functional analysis (bounded and continuous linear operator, Riesz representation theorem...)<br /><br />UPDATE: After reading Folland and Royden's real analysis textbook in this winter I found that sticking on Stein's textbook is rather insufficient... Some content appeared in midterm and final like convergence in measure (midterm) and convergence modes (final) can be directly found in both textbooks but absent in Stein's book...",
            "comment_teaching": "Wonderful. I can't believe that with that short period of teaching time, such an adequate amount of content is included. <br /><br />One of the most appreciated things for me is that when he started a module (mul cal/measure theory/integration/FTC/Hilbert space) he will introduce the motivation for discussing them. He also sometimes briefly talked about the motivation behind the steps for each proof.<br /><br />Also he (smartly and deliberately?) put some advanced but less applicable theorems like generalized Lagrange multiplier, converse of Lusin theorem, Steinhaus theorem, strong-type inequality... to homework, which motivated me to self-learn them through finishing the related problems.",
            "comment_grading": "Although I only got a B range (well, in both 2043 and 3043) given that I have already read the textbook once in summer, I found that my understanding for real analysis is still not all-rounded (I am too focused on the big picture instead of the technical stuff) and I think I deserve this grade.",
            "comment_workload": "Although there're only 4 hws with selected problems (4 out of 10) graded, the other ungraded ones are also important because they usually include advanced theorems (see above). Some of them are also essential contents that should study to prepare for exams.<br /><br /><br />For exams, the understanding to the contents is much important than reciting them (c.f. Kin Li's analysis according to other's reviews?) because there is even an official cheatsheet for students. Also, self-learning the contents taught in the future (well if you know) also makes you advantageous in the exam because he DID test untaught stuff that was going to teach like absolute continuity (2043), Lebesgue number lemma (2043), convergence in measure (3043) in the midterms of both courses.<br /><br />Studying counterexamples is also important for exams, but it seems that the emphasis on counterexamples is slightly deeper in 2043.",

Probably has to do with the teaching.<br /><br />Everyone else here seems to have some reference books or something, but I don't unfortunately. Probably explains why my score is that low lol",
            "comment_teaching": "Real Good.<br /><br />Like mentioned by others already, Ivan's teaching is very clear and intuitive. This is different from &quot;very understandable&quot; though, this course is hard after all, but he definitely puts a lot of effort in making sure students can follow his steps, such as visualizing some of the more &quot;abstract&quot; (this course is abstract enough) statements and proofs, like that for the Vitali's 3-Covering lemma.<br /><br />He also provides a discord server for answering student inquiries and some other chit-chat(?), which helped with understanding the lesson material and homework questions a lot.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading, like MATH2043, is more lenient than normal courses. <br /><br />Above mean guarantees an A- (which is not easy at all tbf), which Ivan further extended to cover 60% of the students. Quoting him from the discord server, it's a &quot;privilege of honor course&quot;.<br /><br />Exams are generally very very hard (revising the lecture materials is far from enough), but the finals provide &quot;hint systems&quot; that deducts some points in change for useful hints for finishing the problem.<br />In Hint System we trust.<br /><br />At the end I got A- (didn't buy enough hints), but it is honestly surprising I got here in the first place with insufficient foundation, and close to no preparation for the course materials.",
            "comment_workload": "Singlehandedly made my low-credit semester relatively hectic.<br /><br />The workload isn't that much of an increase compared to MATH2043 (4 hw with 10 questions each), but rest assured you will need quite an amount of time to think of each question.<br /><br />Especially for some questions, which are basically like &quot;extra corollaries/theorems&quot; very related to but not covered by the course materials, while they are really good &quot;self-learning&quot; materials, they usually took me the longest time to think of (and while some of them have solutions online, making sense of them is still really hard)<br /><br />I did not start my assignments that late, but there are 2 hws where I had to give up sleeping on the day before deadline to finish them barely on time.",
