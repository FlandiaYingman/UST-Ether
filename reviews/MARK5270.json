        "description": "Much of a firm's profit is determined by how it sets price and manages pricing. A company can create goods and services with tremendous economic value but fail if it sets price incorrectly and does not capture that economic value. Through relevant case studies and examples drawn from different parts of the world, this course will introduce students the concepts around setting the best price: economic value analysis, price elasticity, and pricing models and willingness to pay.",
