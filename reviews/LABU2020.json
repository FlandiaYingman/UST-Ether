        "description": "The course organizes a student’s previously acquired English language skills into a useful managerial toolkit targeted toward specific business applications and strategies. Students learn how to adapt and apply their English language abilities to real-world assignments within their business major and, after graduation, to career tasks and opportunities. Positioned toward the latter portion of a student’s undergraduate business education, the course prepares students to succeed in their remaining university assignments (such as research tools, written tests, presentations, interviews, meetings, collaborative assignments, interpersonal communication and so forth) as well as the communication challenges they can expect in their careers. For students in their third or fourth year of study who have this course as a program requirement.",

I think this course is meant to help students be used to talk in public once we get jobs. <br />HOWEVER, I really think that this type of course should be offered as workshops instead of a 2-credit course. I think this course encourages students to write CV simply to satisfy the professor instead of expressing themselves. Also, the job interview asked me the weirdest question like &quot;What is 76 X 45?&quot; and he took some points of mine for answering a number far off from the answer (wtf this aint a math course KK)",

When doing in class activities, students will find him walking around to stop by if anyone needs help.

Also, don't miss more than 2 classes because you will then fail!",
            "comment_workload": "Compared to other LABU classes with heavy case analysis and presentation, this LABU class required almost no workload. If you originally are a talkative person who does not get nervous talking to the crowd, you do not need any extra work outside class (which was my case). <br />But, I've seen a lot of my shy friends in class struggling. They practiced a lot to not be nervous. But still, the workload is really light compared to other LABU course.",

Team Presentations, 國泰Catering Service既Case, 會有Q&amp;A, 35%<br />4. Online Peer Evaluation of Leadership &amp; Teamwork, 5%<br />5. Participation, 你懂的, 15%<br /><br />FYI,<br />就o個3個Assessment黎講, 1) 同 3) 都做得麻麻地, 2) 做得好. <br />平時上堂都有主動答下佢野, 可能呢方面救返我個Grade掛.<br />最後A-, 都幾滿意 :)",
