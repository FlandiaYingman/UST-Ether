Case studies are provided to gain insight on how big corporation manage IT projects.",

Some are pretty interesting, such as having students to build a tower out of spaghetti. Reflections are being done after the activities to show that the management principles are actually being applied into the activities.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is not that good.1 mid term, 1 final, regular online quizzes, 2 lab assignments and attendance are counted toward the grade. For mid term and final, just follow the study guide and recite everything as detail as possible. Little bit of math is needed. Everyone basically got the same mark. Lab assignments are basically easy stuff. ATTENDANCE is what makes you stands out from others. Just raise you hand and answer any question in lecture as much as you could and make professor remembers you. Then you are good to go. I got above 1 SD in mid term, above 0.5 SD in final, full mark for both lab and all quizzes, but didn't answer much questions in lectures, and I got B- :(",
            "comment_workload": "There are lecture videos and follow up quiz every week that you need to complete before the lecture (marks counted). But the questions are very easy so no worry. Also there is a case study almost every week (over 10 pages of reading-_-), but it's not mandatory to read it, though it will be examined in mid term and final so you better recite them. 2 simple lab assignments are also needed (Microsoft project management tools).",

Both hard skills and soft skills required of a project manager has been taught.&nbsp;&nbsp;For hard skills, things covered include the Waterfall &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agile model (when to use them, methodologies, deliverables, metrics, pros and cons etc), MS Project etc. Soft skills include ways to tackle difficult scenarios that Project Managers might encounter (eg. As a Project Manager, you are about to have a status report with your client.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, your project has a major technical problem that causes schedule delay, but you think your team will be able to catch up on full turbo in the coming week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you inform the client of this problem in the upcoming meeting? Will your decision change if the meeting is held tomorrow or in one week's time?)<br />All in all, I would say this is an insightful course not only applicable to people with the job title of Project Manager.",
