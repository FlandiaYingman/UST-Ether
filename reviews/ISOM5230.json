There are a lot of weekly reading but you are not required to read them all. <br /><br />But the reading material are useful<br />If you want to get better grade or simply learn more about the topic.<br /><br />Assignment:<br />The topic and questions are already given and set on class 1. So technically you can start early if you are a early planner. Submission is mid term and the question set are relevant to the taught subjects. I think the workload is ok. I took me a weekend to work on and the grade was ok.<br /><br />Final exam is open book and note (computer allowed as long as not connected to Internet). So you can prepare material before entering the exam. The exam is moderately hard and I don’t think time allow to scrape book and note inside the exam.<br />A lot writing in 3 hour exam.",
