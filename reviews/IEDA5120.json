The goal of the course is to provide students with the background and tools required to perform research in the field. The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 goes for ten weeks and consists of a combination of lectures on discrete-choice models, assortment optimization, revenue management with dependent demands, followed by lectures on pricing analytics including basic pricing theory, dynamic pricing and on-line learning. The lectures will be interspersed with paper presentations that reinforce the theory. Students are expected to read the material provided before coming to class. Part 2 will take place during the three last weeks of the course and will be devoted to project presentations. The instructor will provide a list of current research topics from which the students can select a class project, but students are free to propose their own projects.",
