            "comment_workload": "Quite packed indeed. Quiz 1 and quiz 2 have examined quite a lot of things not mentioned in the lecture notes and during the lecture, which are materials in the textbook. But the textbook is not sold at UST bookstore, so it is a bit ridiculous to examine those materials in my opinion. It was fortunate that I bought the textbook from Amazon. 有2個chapters (Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders, Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders) quiz完全冇考。每個Quiz有3條長題目各佔10分。Quiz2 考左2題屬於Somatic and Dissociative Disorders，係quiz前2堂先教既chapter, 都未夠時間消化，更加冇時間睇textbook。開考後先睇textbook然後不斷copy and paste，用左好多時間溫lecture notes jot down好多notes點知係廢既。考啲野都係奇奇怪怪冇諗過會甘考。例如Quiz1考左MMPI test，臨時先即刻上維基百科睇解釋。好彩film critique 30/30, 先有A-. Film critique 3揀1， 我寫Bipolar disorder, 靠本textbook好多，好多解釋、例子、points都係lecture notes冇提，但film critique要寫落去，都關Bipolar disorder事。Textbook係呢個course係超重要，一定要買！反而果本DSM-V冇乜用。",
