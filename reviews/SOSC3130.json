We were advised to closely refer to the reading written by the Prof. Interestingly, the question was the research question in the reading. Therefore, it was more of a reproduction of the given reading after thorough understanding of the arguments and the way she analyzed it.<br />-Essay - 2500 words in English/ 3000 words in Chinese on a given seminar question with guided readings given. You can even choose the one you presented. However, it was more than a reproduction. Some tips - have to build some arguments and fit the examples from the readings in the right place. <br />-Final exam - Exam was pretty chill.

Each seminar covers up to 5 readings (20 pages long each), some of them are written in English and other Chinese [around 50:50]<br /><br />You will need to prepare one 1,000-word short essay and one 2,500-word long essay, in which it could take time to fully understand the assigned readings if you hope to write something insightful and impressive<br /><br />Everyone needs to form groups to conduct a seminar presentation, which is 45 minutes long, with a 30-minutes Q&amp;A afterwards",
