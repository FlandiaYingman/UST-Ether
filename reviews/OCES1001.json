You will learn like how is the water flow in ocean, biodiversity in the ocean, human activities' effect on the ocean, etc. And if you have taken biology in DSE, you are slightly advantaged as 1 out of 7 topics in this course you have already learned in your biology class.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is good, as each topic is taught by different professor, each professor is really familiar with the area that he will be teaching in class. <br /><br />The overall process of the course is like this:<br />Every week, you watched the video at home, then complete the online quiz, next, go to class to complete the case study. In class, the instructor and TA will be there, and the professor responsible for this week's topic will also be there for you to ask questions and give instructions for you to complete the case study. Then next week, another video will be posted and another professor will be in class to talk about the another case study.<br /><br />This course only have one meeting per week as the another class is organized as online learning mode. You have to watch one video(about 2 hour) per week. You learn while watching the video, then go to class and complete the case study during class time. The video is really clear and easy to understand, so there is no difficulty in learning though the video. Just make sure you really do watch them.(actually you can watch them in 1.5x speed) <br /><br />However, the instructor (Ice Ko) is so annoying. She acts like your high school discipline master and teaches you how to behave in class..... other than her annoyance, other things are really good.",

There will be random grouping each lecture, you have to check the grouping everytime before lecture time. each group will have 4 members to complete the case study together. Then the grouping will change for the next lecture. The case study is also quiet easy. <br /><br />And one final exam<br /><br />Weighting:<br />35% 7 Quiz (5%each)<br />35% 7 Case study (5%each)<br />30% 1 Final exam<br />*Attendance is not taken but you must attend every class because one case study is conducted in every lecture, if you are absent, you will score 0 in that case study, which means you lose 5% in all total grade.",

As an engineering student these were pretty boring, but not too hard to understand.<br /><br />Syllabus as follows:<br />1. Physical characteristics of the ocean<br />2a.Diversity of Marine Life<br />2b.Interactions among Marine Organisms - How do they obtain food?<br />3a. Coastal Processes<br />3b. The Subtidal, Intertidal, and Estuaries<br />3c. The deep sea<br />4. Humans and the sea<br /><br />All of these are quite easy to understand other than 3a, which was quite complex.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is done online by yourself, watch the lecture videos and do the online quiz (does not affect grade). You don't actually have to watch the videos since the professors repeat what is on the powerpoints anyway. <br /><br />Every video has a different professor and the teaching was pretty good, the mainland professors had quite a heavy accent, luckily there are subtitles for every video, so it is not a problem. You only attend classes once a week to do the case studies, after the professor introduces themselves and their field of work a bit more. <br /><br />Ice Ko is the coordinator for the course, and despite not teaching, somehow is able to negatively impact my enjoyment of the course, as she keeps repeating the SIMPLEST of things and refuses to listen to the class. <br /><br />Seeing a fellow frustrated student trying to explain why she was unable to do the quiz because Ice messed the quiz up by changing the submission time WHILE everyone was doing the quiz and only to have her repeat on HOW to use CANVAS was gave me flashbacks to kindergarten. Also refuses to shut up while everyone is doing their exams.",
            "comment_grading": "35% Case Studies<br />Case study every week, 7 in total, 1 for each chapter. You really have to scramble to finish them, and hope god gave you good groupmates or otherwise you would have to try to finish all of them yourself, unfortunately I was not very lucky and did not have the best of group mates. Also pray to god that the professor would randomly visit your group and give you &quot;hints&quot;, (pretty much the actual answer) or otherwise you would not get the highest of marks.<br /><br />10% Concept Map<br />Despite only being 10%, this is quite difficult. Again you would need to work with your groupmates (luck required) and need to make a map connecting ALL ideas taught in the course, it sounds difficult, and is actually even more difficult in reality, we spent a LOT of time doing this. <br /><br />5% Peer Evaluation <br />Give feedback around your groupmates, finish the evaluation for 5%.<br /><br />50% Final Exam <br />Online finals, due to the coronavirus. Open book and only MC questions. Time allowed is very short however so you really have to study and hurry. I spent quite some time studying and still could only BARELY finish the exam. Some questions also seemed out of syllabus? Or at least were super niche, I couldn't find the answers from the powerpoints (Which you should convert to .pdf by the way). <br /><br />In the end I got an A-, with nothing shown on CANVAS other than my concept map, which was a 8/10. It seems my struggle in making the concept map really helped me in the finals. However because such a HUGE part of the course can be affected by your groupmates, you may not want to consider this course if you are not a lucky one, take it if you are feeling brave.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is OK, other than the group projects it is pretty light. Go through the chapter materials before the case study, and studying for 2-3 days before the final is enough. <br /><br />In the end it depends on what kind of groupmates you get, because of my groupmates I spend a lot of time reading the powerpoints and fixing the concept map for them, and it somewhat helped in my finals I guess...",

Luckily, my groupmates are really nice, so I don't see doing case studies as a challenging work. Time is pretty tight, so you gotta do it together asap. <br /><br />Final concept map: (submit before final exam)<br />your group has choose 2-3 modules and basically make a huge concept map connecting all the chosen topics. Not difficult as long as you have studied the topics.<br /><br />Exam:<br />1hr30mins, all mc open book exam (sorry i forgot the number of questions)<br />a very rushed exam as i remembered, i think i missed out a few questions. So open book or not doesn't really matter, you wouldn't have sufficient time to go through your notes. <br /><br />Is the workload high? maybe, for some people.
