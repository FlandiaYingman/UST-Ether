Romantic period<br />4. 20th century.<br />However, the order is different, <br />1. Classical period<br />2. Baroque period<br />3. Romantic period<br />4. 20 century.<br />The professor covered prominent operas or operas that embody certain period, for example<br />1. Classical period<br />Barber Seville (Opera buffa)<br />Don Giovanni (Drama giocoso)<br />2. Baroque period<br />The enchanted period (Composed not at the Baroque period but it sounds like it)<br />3. Before Baroque period<br />L'Orfeo (seconda pratica)<br />4. Romantic period<br />Carmen<br />Ring Cycle<br />5. 20th century<br />Nixon to China<br />Wozeck <br /><br />You should expect many terms of opera being covered, for example<br />1. singer types (tenor, counter tenor)<br />2. singing styles (aria, recitative)<br />3. opera types (opera buffa, opera seria)<br />4. music theory (diatonic)",
            "comment_teaching": "In my opinion, his pacing is so slow. He talks too slow. Since it was online teaching, there were times when I literally slept during the lecture.<br />He is a passionate teacher and baritone, which is an archetype of opera singers. So you can expect many singings and keyboard demonstrations throughout the lectures.<br />He is kind, for example, he is willing to delay the deadline of quizzes.",

            "comment_workload": "Yes, on paper, this course has insurmountable workload. But, off the record, it just isn't the case.<br />1. Operas<br />Don't watch them before the lecture. Without context, it makes no difference between watching and not. Besides, the professor will play the entire thing during lecture. Besides, the exam will only cover A FEW segments from A FEW operas.<br />2. Quizzes<br />5 Canvas quizzes within 20 minutes. Sounds like a speedrun eh?<br />Nein.<br />Ask yourself some questions:<br />How many power points are covered in this quiz?<br />Have I memorized the title of each power point slide?<br />Have I read the synopsis of the covered opera?<br />How long do I need to take care of all the above?<br />That's it. <br />3. Discussion board<br />Do it a few hours before the deadline when almost everyone has made their comments.<br />Make sure you have bare minimal knowledge.<br />Paraphrase. <br />End of story.<br />4. Mid-term<br />There are 3 parts:<br />MC, short question, listening<br />Make sure you ask yourself the following questions:<br />1. Did i memorize the title of each power point slide?<br />2. Do I vaguely understand the context of each power point slide?<br />3. Did I memorize all the synopsis of all covered operas?<br />4. How long do I need to take care of the above?<br />5. Are you readied to google when you completely forget which power point should you refer to?<br />That's it for MC and short question.<br />For listening, <br />Just replace your songlist with all those opera segments 5 days before the exam.<br />Loop until you can vaguely recognize the pattern.<br />Then make sure you memorize the<br />- Composer<br />- Period<br />- Context<br />You are through.<br />6. Project<br />You need good teammates, which I had. Not sure about you though.<br />7. Final<br />Same as mid-term. Except there is essay.<br />But my method is just to conclude each power point chronologically.<br />And I got full credits out of it. LMAO<br />8. Attendance<br />I can't focus during the lecture as I mentioned before, it is boring. I just attended it. Then got the recording and watch it at 2x speed to get the context. Knowing the context will be more than sufficient since there are a lot of fat in lectures that were trimmed in ALL assessments. <br /><br />As you can see, you don't even need to be passionate to get good grades. It had also come to my attention that it is kind of useless to really study all stuff in depth if you are not that into music or opera. The professor will play the parts which he thinks important and go into details that will not even appear in any assessments.",

Moreover, professor Isaac did not show the operas in class, we had to watch them in our own spare time before class. He would then explain what concepts were used in the opera in class, so if you didn't watch the opera, you wouldn't be able to follow along at all. The midterm and final exam consisted of knowing concepts in opera, the main plots of the operas, and memorizing the songs that were played in the opera (he gave us a list of the songs he will quiz such as the title, composer and from which opera it was from.) He would play it during the exam and you had to identify which composer wrote it, from which opera it was from and what was happening in the scene when the song was being played. There is also a group project (our group had 10 ppl in it) We had to choose to modernize a opera of our choice and plan the whole thing from start to finish. We had to rewrite the plot, draw costumes, design background sets, and also choose the venue for our opera and include the financial side of it such as the price of the tickets, venue, expected sales and profit, etc. The opera review required us to attend 2 concerts and 1 workshop and then write a detailed review of them at the end of the term.

The final exam included some short answer questions and one long essay. <br /><br />The weekly discussion forums and quizzes were a bit of a pain but still doable.",
            "comment_teaching": "Isaac was really good at explaining the musical concepts clearly in a lively manner. I seldom got bored because he always incorporated humour in his teaching. He's also a very easygoing professor, e.g. when some of us accidentally missed one week of discussion forum, he would open it up again for us to complete it.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is decent. I got above mean for both exams and got an A in the end. As long as you attend class, complete the discussions and quizzes and opera review essay, study for the exams, do a decent job at the group project and presentation, you'll get a decent grade.",
            "comment_workload": "As mentioned previously, there are quite a bit of work in the course with many kinds of assessment tasks, but all of them are manageable if you enjoy getting to know and appreciating opera.",

The most annoying part is perhaps that along with a final exam you have to make a group presentation AND write a 1500-word opera review.",

It might sound a lot to learn, but it is not. <br /><br />As long as you focus in class, and do some revision every week, you will be fine. Professor said this course was &quot;non-cumulative&quot;, but that's not the case, as some of the content before the midterm will appear again in the final.<br /><br />Don't worry if you don't have any music background, it doesn't matter at all. I don't have any music background as well, but I still got an A. The music concepts are easy to understand, and strict forward. You just have to memorize the &quot;definition&quot; of the musical terms, and that's more than enough.",

Most answers could be directly found on notes, except one or two, so if you target to get full marks in every quizzes, you might need to pay extra attention in classes.<br /><br />Midterm and final are quite similar, both contain MC, short questions and listening questions. You have to listen to a short audio clip and distinguish which opera is it from. Final exam has one more extra part, you have to write a 1000-word essay, but no need to worry too much, as the essay topics would be provided a few days earlier, so you can actually prepare for the essay beforehand.<br /><br />The group project is very easy and chill, there will be around 8-9 people in one group, most of us can get quite a good grade.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is very easy to get A range for this course, as long as you revised.",

There were quizzes discussion, posts, and exams nearly every week. With a group project (10 people) and presentation. Besides, a review based on the assigned opera with more than 1000 words. At last, there was a final with 3 hours length including MC, fill in the blanks, listening, and short answer questions and essay with 800 words. To be honest, as a tough semester, the final really made me struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, listening questions appeared in midterm and final, you have to be familiar with those songs in operas, by listening to the recording in the questions you have to figure out which opera does it comes from, the composers and the plot.",
