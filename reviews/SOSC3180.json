        "description": "Sustainable development integrates improvements in human welfare with improvements in the health of the environment. It is society's attempt to solve the degradation that economic and social development has imposed on the environment. To solve environmental crises such as climate change, pollution, or destruction of biodiversity we need to integrate environmental practices into all our activities, pulling together new technologies, lifestyles, economic theories and business practice, and government policies. This course looks at how this process of integration works at the international, national, and municipal levels and from the organization perspective of different industrial sectors, businesses, and communities.",
