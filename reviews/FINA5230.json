        "description": "This course puts together a collection of industry cases, projects and academic papers on Sustainable Investing, also known as ESG Investing. It is an investment approach that integrates three additional factors - environment (E), social (S) and governance (G), into security analysis and portfolio allocation. As the industry successfully adopts these factors into their double bottom line financial analysis, only a handful of courses - such as this one - would tackle the subject. This course will discuss the market terminology, practices, usages and dollar impact of ESG factors. The main focus is on the identification, measurement and the materiality of ESG indicators. The students will learn that financial analysis with ESG integration provides the basis for a more informed investment decision. Discussion on existing academic papers will shed light on the cost and benefits of sustainable investing. This course will empower the students with cutting edge information, tools and solid research on the subject.",
