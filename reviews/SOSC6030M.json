        "description": "This course introduces students to the theory and practice of participant observation, with a particular focus on using ethnographic research for studying socio-political change in Hong Kong. We begin by reading carefully and critically two examples of ethnography: an urban ethnography in the Chicago School tradition and a comparative ethnography in the extended case method tradition. We will then discuss the methodological and analytical strategies of these two paradigms of ethnographic research. Next, we examine the logic of formulating research questions, sampling, casing, comparison, inter-subjectivity in interviews, concept formation, theoretical construction, ethical and political issues in doing ethnographic fieldwork. For those continuing with the second part of the course in the Spring Semester, we will work together on ethnographic projects related to public sociological issues in Hong Kong. Along with extended immersion in the field, we will learn to code, analyze, conceptualize and theorize from and with the data. The final product of the practicum is a paper that students can submit to professional journals for review and publication.",
