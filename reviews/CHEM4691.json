        "description": "Students will carry out a research project in one of the Chemistry research laboratories under the supervision of a faculty member. This research-based course provides students an opportunity to integrate and apply their chemical knowledge learnt in regular lecture and laboratory courses. At the end of the course, students are required to submit a written report and deliver an oral presentation to document their learning experiences. For CHEM students only. Students should seek instructor's approval prior to enrollment in the course.",

Project was pretty meh, not too difficult but not very interesting either.<br />there are also 4 library workshops concerning the usage of search engines, Refworks for citations, and softwares for drawing professional chemical structures.",
            "comment_teaching": "RA mentor was super nice and friendly, learned a lot of lab techniques. Prof sometimes came over and checked on progress, he was available if you have questions and seemed friendly. Don’t be fooled though, if he offered you to join his lab as research graduate student, think twice! His mentoring is questionable at best, and I know that because of personal experience and also from past members. Fantastic teacher perhaps, effective PI and good leader? Not so much.<br />Hint: 2210,3210,4240<br />To all the UG comrades, profs speaking canton =/= being good PIs, choose labs that actually do innovative and interesting research, or you'll suffer.",

Prof will visit the lab a few times a day. You can say that the prof is caring... or annoying. I didn't really learn a thing from the prof. I can tell that pg students were not close to their prof as well. I chose this prof because he speaks Cantonese and he seems nice in lectures.

Both of them took me a lot of time to prepare. As the topics of the research project was very new to me, I need to read a lot of research paper that I was not very familiarize with.",
