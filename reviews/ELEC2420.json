            "comment_content": "This course is a more simple version of ELEC2400, fitted for non-ECE students like MECH/AE.<br /><br />Chapter 1: Fundamentals<br />Everything here is simply DSE knowledge (Current, Voltage, Power)<br /><br />Chapter 2: DC Analysis<br />First half is still DSE-like, same voltage / current solving techniques but with more fancy / formal terms (KCL, KVL)<br /><br />Second half is a bit new, but you should have no issues solving these problems as long as you apply the basics from above. (Superposition, Thevenin and Norton's theorem)<br /><br />Note that this chapter will confuse you with the positive and negative signs, so please be aware of them.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Operational Amplifiers<br />Things start to get very new from here. This chapter teaches you how this device increases the voltage gain with its internal design.<br /><br />I recommend spending more time on this chapter than the previous two, you may consider watching YT videos as they really helped me to clear up concepts and techniques.<br />(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJEMYhrIfs)<br />(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJDjWZqhpVc)<br /><br />Chapter 4: Transiet Analysis<br />It's almost like DC Analysis, but instead of constant voltage and current, this one analyzes constantly changing ones. It introduces you the concept and application of a capacitor (and inductor, but we skipped it this term). A capacitor is simply a storage device that could be charged or discharged, and it has different voltage and current within a time period. <br /><br />Although the First Order Linear Differential Equations look difficult at first glance, this chapter only requires you to memorize three equations.<br />1. Voltage of charging capacitor<br />2. Voltage of discharging capacitor<br />3. Current of charging/discharging capacitor (Same equation for current in both states)<br />(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4EUwTwZ110)<br />(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLQrPqYlPmI)<br /><br />Chapter 5: Binary Arithmetic<br />My fellow ICT students, our knowledge is finally transferrable! This basically teaches you binary, decimal, hexidecimal, and octal numbers. Of course, binary would not be completed without 2's complement. Then add in a little bit of addition and subtraction operations, you got yourself a mostly very easy chapter! <br /><br />The only new thing here is probably Analog-to-Digital Conversion and vice versa, but still, not difficult to understand in general.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Boolean Algebra and Combinational Logic<br />Boolean Algebra is well... Boolean Algebra. Not difficult to learn, but it takes time to understand the identities and boolean laws. I personally think if you have taken any programming course, you could treat boolean laws as AND, OR, and NOT operations. It makes everything so much easier to understand. (Honorable mention to K-map, the ultimate solution to simplify functions!)<br /><br />Now for the combinational logic... Jesus where do I begin with... it utilizes boolean algebra and introduces a few logic devices (Half Adder, Full Adder, 4-bit Adder, MUX, DEMUX, and ROM) All I could say is spend more time on this chapter, otherwise you'll be in trouble for chapter 7.<br /><br />(K map: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO5alU6PpSU)<br /><br />Chapter 7: Sequential Logic<br />This difference between this and combinational logic is, this logic remembers the previous input and output then puts them into the next output, forming a sequence, as the name suggests. On the other hand, cominational logic only remembers the input but not the output of the previous stage. <br /><br />There are two main components in this part, Latches and Flip Flops. These two are basically storage devices and they have different versions: Set-Reset (SR), Delay (D), Toggle (T), and Jack Kilby (JK) for both components. In a nutshell, a latch DOES NOT depend on time to modify the sequential output, while a flip flop DOES depend on time. Hope this one clears up the confusion a lot of students make. <br /><br />Please take time to understand time graphs of different devices, you are certainly going to face them in your finals. <br /><br />Besides lectures, there are tutorial sections and three labs. Tutorials basically reviews everything in the lectures, while the three labs require you to use a lab kit (which will be given to you at the beginning of the semester) to conduct experiments and write lab reports. Lab reports are graded but simple, just follow the instruction manuals step-by-step and write the values you see on the screen, very straightforward. Once you completed the report, ask the TAs to check your workings and they will give you a unique code to verify your completion.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Srivastava does well in teaching during lectures, and I could see he has passion in this course. However, perhaps I'm too weak at hearing, there are moments I could not hear clearly what he is saying, it may be a combination of heavy accent, masks on, and horrible speakers echoing. Also, his hand-writing on screen is a little... messy. But overall, he is a decent professor. [One of his famous quotes would be: &quot;Does anyone have questions? If no, then I have a question for all of you.&quot; *Proceeds to ask us and solve the question on the powerpoint*] <br /><br />Dr Ricky Choi (TA) has to be one of the BEST TAs in HKUST history. Not only does he show passion during tutorials, he is actively answering students' questions and his humor does make the vibe a lot better. Famous quotes: &quot;If you don't understand this, see you next year!&quot; or &quot;Why do I define voltage as negative? Because I like it.&quot;",

            "comment_content": "ELEC2420 is a more concise version of ELEC2400 provided for non-ECE students. The course is divided in two parts, covering analog and digital electronics:<br /><br />Analog electronics:<br />1. Fundamentals<br />2. DC Analysis<br />3. Operational Amplifiers<br />4. Transient Analysis<br />Digital electronics:<br />5. Binary numerals<br />6. Binary algebra and computational logic<br />7. Sequential logic<br /><br />While the course is generally easy, you may note that there is a huge gap between the course's analog and digital contents, with the contents about digital electronics being mostly irrelevant to analog electronics (perhaps an exception is when explaining the construction of 555 timer). You could be confused if one expect that all course content will be taught in a progressive manner.<br /><br />Among all course contents, only Chapter 1 and (part of) 2 are related to DSE Physics. Moreover, you'll need to adapt negative notations for current and voltage, in which you won't see them in DSE, so previous DSE Physics experience won't be too useful here.<br /><br />On the other hand, Minecraft players who mess with redstone electronics will have a larger advantage when understanding the digital components of the course (though don't expect any extra advantage if you can only build a switch-and-door system).<br /><br />-&gt;Yes, I'm serious. As the course provide no lab opportunity for us to learn about more complex electronics components (like SR latches, T flip flops), building equivalent components in Minecraft do help with understanding their operation. After all, it can be confusing when facing all that master-slave structure of flip flops only by looking at the graphs and limited examples.",
            "comment_teaching": "In general, Professor Srivastava taught in a satisfactory manner. Before lectures commenced, he'd allocate some 15 to 20 minutes to revise previous course content, which can be useful for those who skipped lectures. Despite being of Indian ethnicity, Professor Srivastava's English accent was clear, so misunderstanding shouldn't be a big problem.<br /><br />However, some lecture examples mismatches with the difficulty of homework, which means homework questions are more difficult than lecture examples. This is especially true for the topic transient analysis. Moreover, when approaching the end of the course, a lot of complex digital electronic components were introduced with few examples provided, which can be fatal for those who have difficulty in understanding later content.<br /><br />Speaking of Ricky Choi, he is definitely one of the best TA in HKUST. His tutorials were clarifying and helps with understanding lecture contents that are less explained by the professors. Moreover, he is very accessible by email: on average he'll reply your queries within a few hours in working days.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework (x7): 10%<br />Lab (x3): 15% - Full mark<br />Midterm: 20% - (35/40, mean 27.4/40)<br />Final: 55% - (63.5/70)<br />Unfortunately, as the course Canvas page was deleted after the final, my homework scores are essentially lost. I remember all of my homeworks score &gt;80%, and I scored 100% for 1 or 2 easier homeworks.<br /><br />Midterm and exam questions are generally not tricky as well. Most of them are designed based on previous past papers, probably having a few harder questions to differentiate the better students. Moreover, as previous finals are open-book, the past papers (which should be harder) can better prepare you for the closed-book final exam this time.<br /><br />At the end I got an A for the course, which I think is satisfactory for a rather easy course in my study.",
            "comment_workload": "In this semester, a total of 7 homeworks are issued to us. Apart from reported difficulty mismatch, they're generally easy once you understand course content.<br /><br />There are also 3 labs in this course. One is about using PSpice, an electronics simulation program, to analyze analog circuits, while the other two require you to craft a vehicle that'll change its direction based on light difference. One tutorial introduces you to all the electronics appliances, and the other one is about assembling the vehicle. Honestly I don't think that the labs regarding building the vehicle is that useful towards the digital content: all you need to do is to follow the procedures, build, and debug the vehicle: it's more like &quot;monkey see monkey do&quot;.",

            "comment_content": "1) Basic Introduction about electric voltage, power, current<br />2) Resistor circuit analysis(hardest chapter in my opinion) They took what I learnt in AP Physics C E&amp;M and threw it in the bin xD. Covers Basic resistor analysis, but then branches off into nodal analysis and superposition. This includes Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits which was the biggest pain in my backside. A lot of critical knowledge about short circuits, current direction, as well as a good sense of intuition will be needed. OH yeah also understanding voltage and current dividers is a life saver. <br /><br />3) Operational Amplifiers <br />These may seem daunting when looking at it, but then it's actually really easy once you apply KCL at each point. That being said be very careful with your algebra, I forgot to put a denominator on the mid term and lost 4 points :'). <br /><br />4) Transient analysis. Overall the equations are just given to you on a plate, so just memorise and you'll be fine. <br /><br />5) Binary arithmetic. Really simple, hardest part is going to be 2's compliment, which is actually relatively easy to do, but kinda hard to see whats going on. In the end you can just get away with memorising what to do. <br /><br />6) Combinational logic<br />Honestly its just boolean logic. I really like this unit because we were introduced to multiplexors, adders, and ROM, as well as decoders and logic gates. It is best if you attend the classes and really understand what each lesson goes through or you will sorta struggle. Oh yeah also k-maps are a lifesaver, I recommend watching some Organic chemistry tutor videos about this because the lecturer didn't really do that well explaining, but once I watched the vid my mind was blown. <br /><br />7) Sequential Logic<br />Honestly, this can seem super daunting. But just take time to look at some videos online on how to analyse SR latches, D, T, and K flip flops, honestly, the hardest part is going to be graphing a time graph, but again if you follow what the lecturer goes through in class you should have no problem.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Ki is a pretty great teacher who adds his sense of humour into the class. He does teach most things very thoroughly but again some things like nodal analysis, thevenin and norton thereom, k maps, and latches and flip flops are not taught very well. Go watch organic chem tutor. like seriously I'm not kidding. <br /><br />Ricky Choi is my favourite TA, he is very passionate, and he explains things really well. He is very easy to contact and will help you out especially if you need to do make up labs (for a legitimate reason lolol)",
