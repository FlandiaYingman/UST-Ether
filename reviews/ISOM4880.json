For my team's project, we focus on Chai Wan Laundry, which is a laundry of Hospital Authority. <br /><br />Our team has focused on Quality Control Process. We have tried to validate their process, develop a model, and give them suggestions.",
            "comment_teaching": "A supervisor has been arranged to be teaching our team and answering our inquiries. He has spent a lot of effort on us, not only covering what we were supposed to learn in this class, but he also shares his option towards other company's practices. Our discussion is more than coursework. <br /><br />The guidance given is not that clear, it gave me the opportunity to explore and identify what should be used for analysis. It was about problem solving too.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is good (I think), it is graded by professor, the supervisor, and the client. The marks will also be adjusted based on peer evaluation. <br /><br />I am not sure about the grading distribution, but I have got grade A in the end.",
            "comment_workload": "No class, no lecture, no quiz, no final exam.<br />Only through meetings arranged on your own, final presentation, and final report.<br /><br />Time has to be spent on communicating with the company as well.<br /><br />But it is really cool as the schedule is so feasible and can be come up within the group.",
