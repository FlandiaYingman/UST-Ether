Highly recommend taking this course for fundamental knowledge in data analysis research. Some R applications are taught for empirical stufffff. The professor actually planned to cover more content but he was kind of behind the schedule.",

Even if you are not really good at econometrics I believe by taking his course you can find yourself understanding the rationale and concepts. Though I am not really good at math and do not get a good grade in this course, I would say it is worth taking this course under Professor Feng's teaching haha.<br />He always goes through the concept clearly and simply so I guess the pace might be too slow for skilled students but hahaha really suitable for me la. <br />(In my really personal opinion, if you are not good at math but would like to challenge and learn more in econometrics I really recommend you to enroll in this course, forget about the grade you can really learn something and get confidence!!)",

(I have never seen a final exam for a 4-level course with an average of 87/100. Pretty ridiculous huh.)<br />It seems like students taking this course are pretty good at math and econometrics. Might also be due to the small number of students enrolled in this course (33) and the final exam is not that difficult as well.",
