        "name": "Psychology of Environmental Sustainability",
        "description": "Environmental degradation is in part caused by human behavior, and has detrimental impacts on human health and well-being. Psychology, the scientific study of human mind and behavior, therefore has an essential role to play in the identification of effective strategies for the attainment of environmental sustainability. This course is aimed at helping students understand environmental sustainability through the psychological perspective. There are three focuses in the discussion: (i) reciprocal impacts between humans and the natural environment; (ii) psychological factors that determine behavior contributing to environmental sustainability; and (iii) psychological processes that foster a harmonious relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is suitable for students who want to acquire a more advanced understanding of psychology, and students who are concerned about environmental issues. This course also contributes a social and human perspective to the university's efforts in environmental responsibility and sustainable development. Learning activities: lectures, class activities, written assignments, team project (in collaboration with two local environmental organizations).",
