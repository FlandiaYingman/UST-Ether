        "description": "Science covers subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology etc. Evolving over time, the boundaries between these subjects become vaguer and vaguer. Engineering is the application of science and math to solve problems. Evidently, we see more and more science-engineering interdisciplinary subjects that deal to the rich view of the world that they develop. This course, “Nature Engineering and DNA nanotechnology”, is designed to serve this purpose. There will be the integration of materials science and engineering, chemical engineering, thermodynamics, bioengineering, environmental engineering, and microelectronics in this course and summarize the mission of chemical and biological engineering in this composition. This course is designed for CBE and BIEN year 3 and year 4 students.",
