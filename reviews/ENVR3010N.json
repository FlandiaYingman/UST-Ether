        "description": "This course starts by describing how sustainability fits into the process of designing new products and improving existing products for their environmental performance. It will introduce the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to product design and describe different LCA tools in use today as well as eco-strategies that can be employed to increase environmental performance of products. In this course, students will undertake a project to become hands-on with a standard LCA tool fit for product design and use it for comparing alternative product designs for their environmental impact.",
