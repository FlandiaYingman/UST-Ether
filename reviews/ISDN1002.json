        "description": "Design Research is an introduction of research methodology and methods used for exploring problems as well as identifying opportunities for design initiatives. It guides designers how to unravel needs and problems in the real world before inventing. This course introduces students various design research principles, methods and ethics for investigating people and their world. It is a learning-by-doing course in which students, work in groups, learn the principles in class and apply them in the field. The course sets out several challenges in local context. After conducting both contextual research and user research, students are guided to seek insights and identify opportunities for technological innovation aiming to solve the identified problems. Overall, students explore the real world in a lively yet methodical way.",

            "comment_teaching": "Teaching was very good, Luisa is very friendly and approachable, she creates a very comfortable learning experience in class, and lets the class discuss and ask questions. The lecture experience is very good.<br /><br />It is also very easy for us to email her if we have any problems, and she would always reply quickly with detailed explanations.<br /><br />She also gives feedback on your work every week, which is very helpful in performing well in the course as you get to understand where you could improve, and where you have done well. <br /><br />The TAs also give very good feedback, their insights on your work is also very helpful in doing your project. Overall I believe the teaching for this course is excellent.<br /><br />Attendance is required, but either way you should come to every class since the concepts in the PowerPoint may not be very clear.",
            "comment_grading": "The Design Research Report (individual work) 50%<br />This is the main part of the course, you are required to create a book, detailing your design research.<br /><br />Interim Design Research Critique (teamwork) 20%<br />A presentation of your major key research insights, design opportunities and the Design Brief.<br /><br />Final Design Research Critique (teamwork) 30%<br />A presentation of the redefined problem and your new user experience, supported by a series of cultural probes, user journey map and prototypes. <br /><br />As you can see, you are required to work in a team for the project, so there is always the chance of getting bad teammates, luckily my teammates were quite capable.<br /><br />The presentations are also less difficult than you may think as it is only a 5 minute presentation, and you have already done the content for the presentations prior to it. You only need to copy and paste what you already wrote, and repeat it in the presentation.<br /><br />Grading is not clear, you don't get to see your exact score, but from Luisa's feedback you can get a general sense of how you did from the language used.<br /><br />Overall, I received &quot;good&quot; for my presentations and a few &quot;well done&quot;s on my chapters, and got an A-, grading is OK, but the price I paid for it is a heavy one.",
            "comment_workload": "While most things about the course is great, the workload is very heavy. <br /><br />You are required to do something every WEEK, such as writing a report, interviewing people, designing and making your probe, giving the probe to people and receive their feedback, and more. You are also encouraged to use InDesign to create your project, instead of Word, which also meant you need to learn a new piece of software to make your project, which is also time-consuming.<br /><br />I had 6 courses this semester, and this one course easily took up 40% of my time, I need to put almost a full day of work into this course every week. However I would rate it as a C instead of D since the things you needed to do is not difficult, only time-consuming. The amount of work for a 3 credit course is just very heavy.<br /><br />Overall, despite the workload, I still enjoyed the course, so I recommend it.",
