        "description": "This course begins with some basic properties of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields. Then we study the tangent cones of varieties and derive some criterions of smoothness from it. Finally, we go through the process of normalization to partially resolve singularities. Students have to seek approval from the instructor to take this course.",
