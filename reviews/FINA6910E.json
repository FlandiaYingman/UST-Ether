        "description": "Venture capital (VC), a type of private equity (PE) that provides financing to early-stage and emerging firms which are deemed to be too risky for traditional financing, is the financial engine that drives innovation worldwide. However, it is rather mysterious to many people in the field of finance, even to some experienced entrepreneurs and people in general finance, with regard to the internal dynamics of the VC industry.  This course will lift that mysterious veil away and reveal its true color. The class will cover how the venture capital industry works, all the parties involved, and the dynamics therein. More specifically, the students will learn how VCs raise money, now they construct a fund portfolio, how they make investment decisions, how VC returns are calculated, and importantly what you need know and do to land a job in this mysterious sector of high finance. I will use real world examples from my personal experiences in some of the largest and most respected and successful VC firms in the world (Khosla Ventures, Softbank, Formation 8, etc) to drive home these points.",
