            "comment_content": "This course is mainly about standard techniques in image processing. I quite like the syllabus of the course. It covered stuff from a wide range of difficulty and some of the methods introduced is quite interesting. For example, you can segment an image with a lazy snake that tries to minimize his energy level! <br /><br />List of Topics:<br />Topic 1: Image representation, MATLAB programming<br />Topic 2: Spatial domain image enhancement<br />Topic 3: Frequency domain image enhancement<br />Topic 4: Image restoration and filtering, Non-linear filtering<br />Topic 5: Morphological image processing<br />Topic 6: Image segmentation<br />Topic 7: Image registration<br />Topic 8: Image compression<br />Topic 9: Face detection and recognition<br />Topic 10: Feature descriptors<br /><br />Don't get confused by the segmentation/object detection/face recognition part. This course focused on more traditional image processing based methods instead of state-of-the-art deep learning stuff. Although some of the stuff may seemed old-fashioned, they are still being widely used as of today.<br /><br />Some of the research topic by the professor was also included. Nevertheless, the exam only focused on the standard stuff so you don't need to worry too much.",
            "comment_teaching": "I don't know why but I like the professor's voice lol. Anyway, I think he did a good job in teaching. He tried to explain the slides with annotations and drawings which should not be too difficult to catch up for most students. However, he did speed up a bit in the late half of the semester so you may want to rewatch the video if you miss some of the points.<br /><br />The professor did answer the question asked in class. He also don't mind to explain something again if we got confused on the concept. Overall, he is a nice prof. that explains things clearly.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading seems quite nice from the statistics although I need more data to judge that confidently. If I assume the SD is similar to a normal COMP course exam (18~20), I would be ~1-1.2 SD above mean, which normally would be an A- or A. And, the highest score is 97 which suggests high score should be possible (not for most people tho :C). I am quite surprised to get an A+. Also, my friend got B+ with 0.5 SD above mean (with the same assumption) so it should be slightly better grading than average.<br /><br />I didn't check my exam paper. But, I don't have enough time to finish the last question on AdaBoost (a standard question appeared in the assignment) and that question worth 13 points. I would say if you are not too careless, a good grade should be possible. <br /><br />Grade breakdown and statistics:<br />Assignment 1: 100/100 (Mean: 86.6)<br />Assignment 2: 100/100 (Mean: 80.7)<br />Assignment 3: 100/100 (Mean: 82.4)<br />Assignment Total (40%): 40/40 <br />Exam (60%): 84/100 (Mean: 64.6, High: 97)<br />Overall: 90.4% =&gt; A+<br /><br />My friend: Assignment 3 deduct ~10 point + exam 73.5 =&gt; B+<br /><br />Note: The weighting between 3 assignments are uneven but the exact weighting was not announced. The professor said it should be about (10%, 15%, 15%) at the start of the semester.",
            "comment_workload": "There are total of three assignments. The assignments are not easy. You may need some time to do experiments and think deeper on how to implement the algorithm. (Simple loops will be too slow!) As the implementation is not that straight forward, there might be unexpected issues coming up. Do reserve two or three days for each of the assignments.<br /><br />No past papers were given. However, do spend some time to try out (and maybe speedrun) the examples given in lectures. It is especially important in this online setting as most will got his/her pace slowed down in online exams. Try to be conservative in time management too as you cannot go back to the previous question. In fact, I got shocked when the AdaBoost (a standard but long question, pure computation) question comes up as the last question.",

So, it is easier than a typical level 4 elective. That is also why it has an extremely high mean/median score.<br /><br />However, if we are to consider the number of chapters in the course and the semester duration, I would say that the content is rather appropriate. <br /><br />Chapters include the following:<br /><br />Introduction<br />Image Fundamentals<br />Image Transformations<br />Image Filtering<br />Image Restoration<br />Image Compression<br />Morphological Image Processing<br />Image Segmentation<br />Image Registration<br />Feature Extraction<br />Image Recognition and Deep Learning<br />Advanced Topics in Medical Image Processing",

To be fair, they do provide hints for questions like that.<br /><br />Finals, on the other hand, provide more flexibility since mean/median is more &quot;typical&quot;.<br /><br />To break it down:<br />Assignment 1 (10%): Median 94, High 100<br />Assignment 2 (10%): Median 100, High 100<br />Assignment 3 (10%): Median 100, High 100<br />Midterm (30%): Median 82, High 100<br />Final Exam (40%): Median 75, High 97<br /><br />My weighted overall is around 95, which translates to an A+. <br /><br />Some questions in exam relate to details mentioned in small font/images (like the phase angle) and are easy to be missed.

The final project was either a survey project or a research project, which I chose to evaluate existing methods or to propose new methods on a problem in the research one. <br /><br />Introduction to image processing. Topics include image processing and analysis in spatial and frequency domains, image restoration and compression, image segmentation and registration, morphological image processing, representation and description, object recognition, related application areas and some other closely related topics. Some sophisticated image processing and analysis tools and state-of-the-art methods may also be introduced subject to the availability of time.",

Also, he is a kind person and considerate to the students; at one time, he postponed the deadline the final project to provide the students more breathing time. However, he does not speak good English, which may affect how the students understand the materials.",
            "comment_grading": "The assignments and exams were a bit too easy and could not differentiate the students' grades too much. The grading of the project might have a greater impact.

The mid-term and final were super EAZY. Some of the questions are just variants of the ones in the assignments. However, the group project needed some considerable amount of effort and time.",
