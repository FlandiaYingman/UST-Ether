The first module covers basic theories like EV model. The second module covers different price segmentation fences. The third module covers pricing wars and consumer laws. The modules also have one case study at the end. These case studies will be included in the quizzes. There are alot of real world applications as well in the modules. It is a very interesting course and you ll come out as a smart shopper.",

            "comment_workload": "You can expect alot of workload in this course since it is 4 credits. The group project I would say requires alot of effort and time since you have to think of a new pricing structure for an existing business. If you dont have a good group then I would say&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll find the project hard. The quizzes are split according to the modules. The modules get harder as you progress through the semester.",

            "comment_content": "I believe this course has only recently been introduced in HKUST. This course is about pricing which is one of the core component in a business marketing strategy. More specifically the content is divided into three module which are:<br /> - Module 1) Value Pricing Framework<br /> - Module 2) Pricing Strategies &amp; Tactics<br /> - Module 3) Pricing Innovations &amp; Ethics<br />The last module is shorter than the first two, and there is quiz at the end of each module.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is nice and fun, is willing to interact with students and answer questions. Even though the whole semester went online, he utilized Zoom quite effectively - meaning I have no idea how better or worse he could be offline. Nevertheless, he is a very qualified and enthusiastic professor. The TA is also cool and helps out.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading scheme is:<br /> - First best Quiz (25%)<br /> - Second best Quiz (25%)<br /> - Participation (8%)<br /> - Group Project (40%)<br /> - Marketing Experiment (2%)<br />Group project is the main component of grading scheme, and the quiz only takes best two out of three. Therefore, you may want to put more emphasis on the group project which has two part - pricing puzzle and pricing project. Refer to syllabus for details.<br />(Group project really does matter, as even I got above mean for Quiz 2 and 3 I ended up with a C due to bad score in group project)",
            "comment_workload": "As mentioned before, the course content itself is not too challenging; the main problem is the group project which has some workload. Attending the Marketing Experiment was easier online, and participation was also not too demanding. Just deal with the GP.",
