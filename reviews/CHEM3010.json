These may range from atomic theory and identification and arrangement of the elements to modern problems such as CO2 and global warming; pollution and environmental clean-up. Unlike other Chemistry courses it will focus on the background to our knowledge, on what experimental evidence our current theories are based, and how old ones were overturned or modified. For science students in their third or fourth year of study under the four-year degree only. Other students with the prerequisites may seek instructor's approval for enrollment in the course.",
