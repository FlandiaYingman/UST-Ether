            "comment_content": "This course will teach you how to collect data, calculate error etc. It combines contents from other course, include: Mech 2210, Mech 2410, Mech 3610, Elec 1010, Mech 3300 etc. But due to the bad teaching, we don't understand anything of how the topic can be related to application. And as the content is so special, it is quite hard to search from the internet for self study. And mech major in other University in Hong Kong don't even have similar course. So it is quite hard to understand the content. And it is also quite useless for us.<br /><br />We also have lab reports. In regular semester, there are totally 10 labs but only 4 of them are required to write a report. The reports are individual. Also, each lab are required to write a lab notebook. But for our semester, we reduce the lab number to 6 but still need to write 4 lab reports.",
            "comment_teaching": "Worst lecture. The tutor do not give any examples for the contents or any explanation. Sometimes he teach the content required for the homework after the homework is due. Most of us don't know how to do the homework so the mean for this course is much lower compare to other course's homework. Although we have tutorial section, it is a Q and A section which they don't teach anything. The knowledge for finishing the homework and online practice will not be explained. And they won't release the solution for the online practice. The solution for homework is also very brief. You cannot understand the lecture notes as it is mostly pictures. It lacks detail explanation which makes it very hard to understand. I need to use last years lecture notes which was done by another professor. Even if you ask him during the &quot;tutorial&quot;, he will only explain the theory, not the detailed solution. So you can't understand it. And for the summer lab report, the deadline is 12th Aug, but the professor said we should submit at least 1 report before 5th Aug so that the grader can gave back feedback in order to correct and improve other lab reports. But after we submit it before 5th Aug, there are still no reply after the submission deadline! So it is useless.",
            "comment_grading": "Online practice 5%<br />Lab notebook 5%<br />Lab performance 5%<br />Report content 10%<br />Report organization and format 10%<br />Homework 10%<br />Mid-term 15%<br />Final exam 30%<br /><br />For the homework, you need to beware of the sig fig of your final answer as it will deduct marks. However, for the model answer of the homework they upload, they don't care about the sig fig and shows the wrong sig fig any way.<br /><br />For mid-term and exam, there are mc questions and long questions.There are 3 long questions and 20 mc question in both exams.<br /><br />For the summer lab, we change the lab to online due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the lab report is individual, they send us different data for each student, which means one person will have one unique data. However, as some group have their lab section earlier, those group can go back to school and finish the lab. This is quite unfair because those people can use group data, which can reduce the workload for data processing a lot. But what makes it worse is the lab notebook. Those earlier lab section group can do one lab notebook per group, but we need to do one lab notebook per student! And for lab 9, 10, as we don't need to have lab report for those 2 lab, the earlier lab section can just write a lab notebook by group which is very easy to get full marks. However, for us we change it to online quiz, which is limited for 10mins for each test and the quiz is very difficult! Those quiz require you to have deeper understanding to the lab which writing the lab notebook doesn't require. The quiz involve a lot of calculation which you need to find it in the lab video. However, they do not show the data in the video very clearly. You will be easily miss the data and lose marks for the quiz. The mean for the 2 quiz are 1.9/5 and 1/2! Most of us cannot get full marks. So I think the grading arrangement is very bad and unfair to us.<br /><br />The marking for the lab report seems to be weird as well. They don't care about the content, but they will deduct marks of your format like not having a page number or reference. However, the example lab report they give also don't have page number. They deduct 2 marks for the page number, and 10 marks for the reference. This is very unreasonable as the FFT part also takes 10 marks, but FFT's content is as much as a individual report which takes more than 10 pages. The marking standard is very unclear. You need to follow every format from Lang4034 strictly. Even though you didn't search any information for the report, you still need to have reference of your lecture notes.",
            "comment_workload": "We postpone our lab to the summer due to the pandemic. The lab suppose to be the heaviest workload. We have total 6 labs in this summer, with only the first 4 labs are required to have report. But we need to write lab notebook for all 6 reports. However, the instruction for the report are not clear, you need to search everything by yourself. And as the teaching is so bad that the lecture content is hard to understand, writing the lab report are quite difficult. Especially for lab 1, I think it is the most difficult lab report. A lot of the content for lab 1 are required to search by yourself. And you need to do Matlab for lab 1 which very few of people knows how to do! The FFT is just one part of lab 1, but it is as long as a individual report. We have about a month for the 4 report during summer, and I could say the time is just about enough. The individual lab report are quite time consuming. It can easily takes 1 week to finish just 1 report. So remember to do it early. We have 3 homework and 5 online practice. The online practice and homework is very difficult as they don't explain much. Online practice should give you score as you has done it.",

There are a list of 10 experiments you have to perform in this course. You have to do all of the experiments and write full report about them. In my semester, the first 5 are based on a two person group. You can choose to have both working for each report or take turns on doing it individually. The other 5 are done in groups of 5 where each person do one report on one of the 5 experiments.<br />[Edit] The course content are quite useful especially when I am having an internship at a research based company. The content could be said to be the most related to research direction.",

Some experiments can even run over the allotted time slot ( Exp 5&amp;6 ).<br /><br />Students are only required to write Lab reports on 4 of the 8 experiments. Everyone wrote a report on Experiments 1 and 2. The other 2 reports were on Experiments 3-8, which were assigned such that members of a group were not writing the same report.<br /><br />The Lab Manual is a crucial tool for this course, be sure not to lose it.

In the homework and lab reports, most of the students get more than 90 marks due to lenient grading of TAs.
