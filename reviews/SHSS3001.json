        "description": "The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science during the last two decades. The course eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic approach that focuses on specific data sets and distinguishes between data measurement and the production of new facts, and how these new facts complicate our understanding of current social theories. The primary motivation for this course design is to stimulate critical thinking, and to encourage students to question received wisdom.",

They were talking about the lecture slide, so actually you just need to look at the lecture slide.<br /><br />Professors tried to raise up discussion so he did not talk about lecture slide anymore, but it felt like that he did not prepare anything to talk about so there was no keen discussion on one topic actually.<br /><br />Then, after the first two days, we did presentation every day. It was a challenge as we do not really get enough time to look through the cases deeply. <br /><br />We only have discussion after the presentation.<br /><br />In class, the professor fall asleep all the time when students were presenting.

After studying all these materials and do your homework well, You would expect to have a better understanding on the big picture of how and what does China changes. And I would say as a common core course, it really helps promoting the thinking-and-questioning sides of social science. No wonder why students can take this to fulfill SSC-SA/SSC-H requirement!",
            "comment_teaching": "It is not an usual face-to-face lecture course, but more like a seminar-course style. Before each lecture, you would watch a short video clip by Professor Lee to get some idea about the theme of discussion in that week. Then you would have to read the online materials. In this mostly self-learning process, the professors seems more like a advisor or a grader than a teacher. In some senses, the &quot;teaching&quot; part here may not be applicable.",
            "comment_grading": "Here is the grading scheme at the year I take this course<br />35% -- 5 group ppt presentations, 15 - 20 min each... (1)<br />35% -- 5 group essays, 1000 words each ... (2)<br />15% -- peer assessment within group ... (3)<br />10% -- Discussion on other groups work ... (4)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;5% -- Individual performance ... (5)<br /><br />(1) (2): <br />There are around 5 essays and 5 presentation throughout the semester for each group. You need to work well with your team to get a higher scores. Also, as the course in fall semster is usually colisted with the post-graduate course MGCS5001, your English proficiency is somehow assumed. If you even found those LANG 1000-level courses (which are usually only deal with one or two individual term paper) difficult or boring, then you would be promised to not end well in terms of your final grade<br /><br /><br />(3):<br />As long as you keep being a good team player and really do your research and writing part well, you should have no problems with this,<br /><br />(4):<br />In each week, there are serveral questions/topics assigned to students. Total number of questions depends on the class size. But one thing for sure is that different groups would be paired up randomly and each pair would receive the same question at that week, so that one group would do writing and the other would do presentation on that topic. And that's why in each week, apart from doing your weekly assignment, you would also be asked to take a look on the other group work before the class meeting to prepare for the discussion. On some weeks you would be confident enough to question the validity of the other's work and in another unlucky days you may find your opponents did a better job that you and you just have to defend your work and to hope the professor would not give you a low score for this.<br /><br />(5):<br />Actually that's the only part I am not so sure how it works Maybe somehow your performance on the general in-class discussion and your ability to raise up a good-quality question also count for the grade. <br /><br />And from the above, you would find no midterm or final exams. And this is because there are none of them in this course!!!! I would say it is one of the good things about the grading.<br /><br />Btw, my final grade is A. I would say with hard working really comes a very good returns.",
            "comment_workload": "As I mentioned before, each week you have to work on the written essay / oral presentation and find some mistakes (...) on another group's work. It is actually quite heavy for a 3-credit common core course. At the first few weeks you may even be shocked by the huge amount of reading materials. But after some days you should be clever enough to know that some materials that are not useful for your assignment could simply be ignored. All you have to do to reduce workload and enhance the quality of your work is just to focus on the right direction and find enough source to support you arguments. And I think this is one of the most important intended learning outcomes of this course. Later if you start your own research on whatever areas, you may find this 1-semester-long research experience useful. So just not to be scared by the possibly huge worload, but try to be open-minded toward this kind of research-seminar-style-course.<br /><br />Below is the curriculum at 2016 Fall for your references<br />https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-hS0kL-WjF2TEVLUjV2dEwxRms",
