        "description": "The course is to use insights from research program to improve the ability to influence the behavior of others. The first objective is to improve the ability of the student to influence the behavior of others, be they consumers, employees, or people outside of a business relationship altogether. This will be accomplished by building on the toolbox that standard economics provides for influencing behavior (namely, incentives and information) with insights from behavioral science.  Influence tools ranging from economic incentives to psychological nudges will be explored and to analyze common mistakes that people make when trying to influence others. Both interpersonal applications (e.g., negotiation, leadership) and organizational applications (e.g., policy interventions to solve managerial problems) will also be discussed.",
