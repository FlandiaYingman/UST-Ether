        "description": "The course aims to systematically introduce major issues of mixed-signal circuit designs and their applications in bio-medical and sensory systems. The first half course is dedicated to mixed-signal IC design. The course starts with 2 review classes on OPAMP design, filter design and circuit noise. Then, the course covers topics on pipelined ADC, Sigma-delta ADC, and SAR ADC. The second half course is dedicated to sensory and bio-medical IC design. The topics include bio-potential detection, implants, DNA detection, CCD, CMOS imaging, and CT/SPECT.",
