        "description": "The course will initiate a sociologically informed conversation about formal education. What social and organizational forces have shaped current educational practices, and how can they be reformed? How does schooling perpetuate inequalities? Why do boys perform so poorly compared to girls in schools? How can ethnic minorities be better served in educational systems? What is the role of the humanities and creativity in education? Why do people now question the value of higher education? What is the future of education? To answer these questions, students will be encouraged to reflect upon their own educational experiences, read sociological accounts of education and participate in contemporary debates about education at all levels in Hong Kong and across cultures.",

(though no attendance is taken, up to 10% extra credit may be awarded to individual students who<br />make regular and outstanding contributions to the in-class discussions, or who frequently ask<br />relevant questions)<br /><br />The instructor also explained the readings in class, so even if you have not finished all the readings, you can still catch up in class.",

But this requires quite an effort to catch up with the class, by reading the weekly assignments frequently and thoroughly, for example. You can hardly catch up with the class nor even learn a thing in class if you do not study the weekly reading assignments or revise the materials taught in the lecture. <br />But Groves' teaching is quite interesting in a sense that he tells some jokes in class to draw your attention and plays some videos on Youtube. This is at least more interesting than those mundane &quot;non-interacting&quot; lectures.",
            "comment_grading": "Fair. Below mean --&gt; C range <br />Mean --&gt; B range<br />The mean for midterm or final exam is quite high (around 60~70 /100) so it is not very easy to obtain a good result unless you revise the topics comprehensively. The questions in the exams are somewhat straight forward. If you understand the meaning/reason/background behind those topics, then the exams are easy to handle. Also paying attention in the lectures is a good practice because it helps understand the materials taught quite a lot. So doing the above can easily get a good grade (for hard-working students).",
            "comment_workload": "As said, this course requires quite a effort to read the very-long-and-full-of-words materials. Unless you are a veteran in sociology and educations, you will find this course quite hard. <br />A project in a group of 5-7 people is required in topics like ethnic minorities and hidden curriculum, etc. Students in a group will need to co-write a 10-page essay to be submitted within a month. Dr. Groves will select some well-performed groups to give a presentation. <br />All these things are quite heavy workload. Lazy people (especially those who do not study for exams, &quot;裸考&quot;), or those without a great interest in education are not advised to take this course LOL.",

(Check out the syllabus).<br /><br />I think the course content is designed quite well. Each class topic is not necessarily related to one another, but there are common important ideas to remember between topics.<br /><br />The PPTs are really helpful to review the overall topics, but the readings are actually the main full content, so you definitely need to do both to understand completely.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Groves is the most chill professor ever. He showed us so many documentaries and also youtube videos that sometimes take up almost more than half of the class time. He would have 5-10 mins breaks in the middle of the class just for us to stretch. But despite that, he's able to explain the concepts clearly and giving us everyday examples that are easy to digest. He also has really cute cats that he sometimes shows to class. Definitely my top 3 profs in UST.",

            "comment_workload": "Quite chill as long as you catch up with the content every week. Doing the readings before class is definitely a must because it complements the learning process and it is the only way that you can contribute meaningfully in class. The readings even tho quite long are actually really fun and insightful in my opinion. And also go to class so you can earn the participation points and catch up with the weekly contents.<br /><br />If you do the above, then you only probably need to revise 1 or 2 days before the midterm and finals (that's what I did).<br /><br />For this semester because everything is online, the assignment was just individual work and it was really a light workload considering the 25% weighting. It can be done in 1 or 2 productive days as well.",

Education and Social Class<br />3. Education and Gender<br />4. Hong Kong Education<br />5. Issues in Higher Education<br />6. Progressive Education<br />All of them are quite interesting, and there are readings/ videos/ ppt slides about the theme.",
            "comment_teaching": "Interactive teaching, and the slides are well-prepared as well. <br />Good classroom management and students love to discuss with him after class. <br />Strong British accent which may be a bit hard for some local students to catch up. <br />A little break of 5~10 minutes is given in each class, which could let students to rest. <br />No computer/ mobile device could be used in the lecture, may be quite harsh to some students.",
            "comment_grading": "No attendance has to be taken, but since each lecture got a heavy content, better ask friends to help jot down notes.<br />Grading is not too satisfactory, even you get high score, it is hard to get A or A+.<br /><br />Grading policy (not very sure) :<br />Group Project 25% (topics can be chosen freely from Social Class/ Ethnic minorities/ HKUST as a university)<br />Mid-term 35% (include topic 1~3)<br />Final 40% (include topic 1~6)<br />10% additional credits given for class participation/ extra voluntary presentation of the group project <br /><br />Group project my group get 24/25<br />Both mid term and final higher than the class mean for more than 1 sd, <br />but I still only get an A- ...not too satisfactory as I think I have already done some of the class participation<br /><br />The exams are quite easy (you can score about 90% if you have finished all the readings and powerpoint, some of the questions are just common sense)",
            "comment_workload": "Quite large in terms of readings, studying powerpoint slides, and group project<br /><br />Each week 1 ~15 pages reading is expected, it is easy if you could finish it each week, but the review is still quite grueling.<br /><br />Project is relatively easy, just a 10-page short project is needed for a team of 4 students.",

To be exact, I would just quote some guided questions in the syllabus that I received at the first class.<br /><br />The course will initiate a sociologically informed conversation about education.What is school for?What social forces have shaped our current educational practices? Does schooling provide new opportunities, or perpetuate old inequalities? How are ethnic minorities marginalized from education systems? Why do boys perform so poorly compared to girls in our schools? What should be the role of the humanities and creativity in education? Why is there a “crisis” in higher education?How might education be reformed?To answer these questions, we will study a number of important sociological works on education and you will be encouraged to reflect upon your own educational experiences, as well as examine contemporary debates about education at all levels in Hong Kong, and across cultures.",
            "comment_teaching": "His teaching is quite good and he is very willing to help any students who cannot follow. It is worth-mentioning that there will be additional office hours just before the midterm and final exam. He will give some hints about the content of the exam, so do take advantage of that. Do try that even if you are good enough as it certainly will boost your score.",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm 35%<br />Project 25%<br />Final exam 40%<br />Optional: Up to 10% extra credits for participation<br /><br />As Prof Groves mentioned during the class, most students attending the lectures regularly and paying attention during the class won't find his exams difficult, so you can expect many students would get a decent score.<br />Overall, my course total is around 83.4% and got a B. The average is around 76.2% (not including the 10% extra credits), so I would not regard this course as a 'good grade' course. It may not be a good idea to take it if you are not good in social science as it is hard for you to get the 10% extra credits. Take myself as an example, I have tried hard to attempt the questions during the class, but I found that I couldn't even answer a lot because I can't really follow the class.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not heavy. Although you are required to do substantial amount of readings frequently (ie 2 times per week, same as the frequency of lessons), you may try to omit it and pay more attention during the class as Prof Groves will have a brief discussion on most of the readings.<br />A group project is required for this course. Nevertheless, you do not need to pay a lot of effort in order to finish it if there is no 'free-riders' in your group.",

If you don't read it before class you will be lost, so please do. <br />- One easy final exam which is pretty easy to do well in if you have done your readings and paid attention in class.
