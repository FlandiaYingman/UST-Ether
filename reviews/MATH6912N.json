        "description": "This course is to study spaces constructed from polytopes, convex sets, and some semi-algebraic sets. The purpose is to obtain knowledge for students to further study the geometric measures of such spaces by extending Minkowski product of convex bodies to semi-algebraic sets. The subjects include the following five aspects: 1. Polytopes, polyhedral, and polyhedral spaces 2. Combinatorial curvatures of graphs, polytopal cell complexes 3.Topological classification of polygonal surfaces with nonnegative curvature 4. Minkowski algebra of polyconvex sets 5. Semi-algebraic sets: (i) Triangulation of semi-algebraic sets, (ii) triviality of semi-algebraic maps, (iii) Euler numbers of semi-algebraic sets, (iv) Minkowski product of semi-algebraic sets, (v) Elementary mixed volumes of polyconvex semi-algebraic sets. Students should seek instructor's approval to register for this course.",
