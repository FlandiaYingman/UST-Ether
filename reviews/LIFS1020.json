Comparing to Prof Chung, Prof Ko is obviously better than him in all the aspects, including the depth of explanation, clearness and enthusiasm.",

After asking the professor to give more information about the mean such statistic, he just simply replied you can refer to the canvas. However, the canvas is unable to obtain any information about the mean. <br />With more evidence sent to the professor, he started to state the mean and S.D to all the students. He claimed that even though the mark for eassy has been changed but it is no problem for the grade published. <br />My score: <br />17/20 (the mean and SD for essay are 17.21 and 1.25)<br />79/100 (The mean and SD for the final are 79.42 and 8.19) <br />Finally result in C+, quite disappointed.",

Probably need around 80% to get B-range, 90% for A-range. Mean is C+. Even in this semester, where we all have to deal with a deadly global pandemic and after they cancelled the midterm. Seems like the grading is even harsher than before, judging from past reviews. It feels like they gave the minimum number of A and B ranges. Final exam was online. 100 questions in 90 minutes, but we could not skip past questions, making it hard to allocate time. The exam also asked for weird details like which US president doesn't believe in global warming. Take this course if you want to lower your GPA.",

Another illogical thing about this is the presentation and the script is basically the same thing. Is it really a good thing that 1 single group project accounts for 45% of your grade? It's a question worth considering. Also, the grading is not transparent as you only get to know the score of the quizzes. <br /><br />For your additional reference, I predicted myself getting B+ to A- judging from my exam and presentation performance, and I ended up getting an A-. I would say it's fair, but I'd definitely prefer a course with higher % for personal work.",

Philip Lam will teach first 5 lectures while Jessica Tang will teach the remaining 4.<br /><br />Philip Lam's lectuer ppts have averagely 60 slides while Jessica Tang's have averagely 85 slides. <br /><br />The first 4 topics are related to secondary 3 biology but more advanced. The topic environmental health is related to the topic climate change in secondary 3 geography. <br /><br />Since I have only little biology background, I needed to spend so much time searching the Internet and watching teaching videos about the concepts, especially starting from lecture 6. I find the topic pathogen hard to learn because it require so much understanding besides memorization.<br /><br />The contents are useful and you would know a lot about the cause of diseases.",

You would find him a little bit humorous when teaching.<br /><br />Jessica Tang also teaches well but her speaking isn't that fluent so sometimes you may find it hard to understand the meaning of whole sentence. However, she can speak clearly. <br /><br />Another thing about Jessica Tang is that she replies email very quickly. Last time I ask her a question through email and she replied and answer my question sufficiently within 15 minutes. So I recommend you email her if you have question especially the day before final exam.",

Although grading lacks transparency, I still give A for grading because I got decent grade. And I think it is not easy to drop into C range because I feel that the instructors are tolerant on presentation and grading.<br /><br />The final exam is more difficult than all 4 quizzes and there are a lot of difficult English words, which may not exist in lecture slides, in the questions. So, native English speakers may be benefited from it.<br /><br />This grading system is very different from the past because the 45% of total score is contributed by presentation which means final exam contribute less. The lecturers don't demand very deep or difficult content in the presentation and hence it is totally managable. The major changes to the grading scheme of this course is that essay is changed into presentation.<br /><br />Reasons why you should consider taking this course:<br />1. It is a common core course<br />2. Instructors in this sem are good<br />3. Grading scheme has been changed(improved)<br />4. If you have nothing to do in summer period so you can concentrate efforts in one course<br /><br />If the instructors of this course in the future semester will not be Philip Lam and Jessica Tang, then the teaching and grading quality might be changed drastically.",

I had to preview the lecture ppt and write a few pages of notes before every lecture because there are too many points that we need to memorize or understand. Viewing 2-4 pages of A4 paper is easier than viewing 70 ppt slides, right?<br /><br />Another worldload is making powerpoint slides and presentation scripts. To be honest, they aren't hard to be done.",

In the past few years, there has been a growing interest in integrating human health, environment, and society between practitioners from different fields. The objective of the course is to address the correlations between the three corresponding areas under a challenging, interdisciplinary nexus.",
