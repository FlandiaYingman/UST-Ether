Professor Huang, in particular, delivers his content from students' point of view, making us feel comfortable in his lecture. (Unlike some professors who teach from their own points of view, assuming us knowing everything.) He explains perplexing concepts steps by steps and further extend the concepts by introducing the examples covered in Phy Chem courses. <br /><br />Professor Su, on the other hand, seems not effective in teaching. I was confused with his explanations on classical wave functions and felt desperate. Since then, I skipped all his lectures and self-learn by studying lecture notes and watching lecture videos. Yet, Professor Su is willing to answer our questions. I remember once upon a time, my friends and I discussed wave function problems with him after class for half an hour. After that, he also shared with us his personal life and his family. So, Professor Su must be the nicest person in the world though he is not the best teacher!",

I survived MATH 1013 &amp; 1014 by reciting the examples of tutorial notes and pastpaper problems. I was even below mean for the final exam for this course (I have no mood to study those perplexing stuff!!!) and I still ended up a B grade. Quite a number of classmates who are not very good at Maths could still get a B grade. For business courses, comparatively, even if you spare no effort studying, in all likelihood you will still receive a ~B grade (competition is too fierce). So 2409 is really good grade in nature.<br /><br />However, be aware of the potential competitors in this course!!! There are quite a no. of ≥ year 3 students enrolled in this course to compete with us an A+. A friend of mine who got 9X/100 in both exams still couldn't pass the cut off score of A+ and was fallen into an A grade!!! So if you desire an A+, you should aim at full score for both exams and assignments.",
            "comment_workload": "In terms of content, this course is quite chur in nature. We have to learn ~16 topics in about 3 months time. The good thing is that final exam is not accumulative. You have the whole reading week to do revision. But for the midterm, the workload is really really huge because the midterm of Org Chem &amp; the submission of Lang proposal were nearly the same period. You have almost no time for revision. So in theory, you should perform better in the final exam.",
