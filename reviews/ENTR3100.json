            "comment_content": "This is basically a seminar-based course, where every week there will be a guest speaker, who has been involved in startups and entrepreneurship, comes and speaks on different topics related to it. Some are fun, but it can get quite monotonous at times, as you only have to sit and listen. <br /><br />It is a good starting point to know about entrepreneurship and making contacts in the industry. <br /><br />There is also a trip to Science Park which is interesting. <br /><br />In the end, you have to form a group and come up with a startup idea, and then present it in class with a working prototype.",
            "comment_teaching": "Personally, if the speakers were more interactive with the audience, and there were more hands-on learning approach to the course, I would have really enjoyed it. <br />The professor is very eccentric and knowledgeable and can definitely help/invest if you have an idea.",
            "comment_grading": "Lesson reflections \t30%<br />Basically, you have to write a reflection on how the guest speakers lecture was relevant, whether you have any personal opinions on the content, and also summarise it a bit - be careful of the word limit, it is quite less compared the information they require from us so you need to be smart in writing it. <br /><br />Group Project Report (30%)<br /><br />Group Presentation\t(20%)<br /><br />Peer evaluation (10%)<br /><br />Course Participation (10%)<br />Simple attendance gives you this grade.<br /><br />I ended up getting an A, probably didn't get A+ because we exceeded the time limit for presentation.",
            "comment_workload": "Very minimal workload mostly. In the end can get a little hectic as you have to write the report, and prepare the presentation. But if you have good group members, it wont be a problem.",
