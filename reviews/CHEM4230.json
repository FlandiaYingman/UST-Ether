The characterization methods will include electron spectroscopies, electron microscopies, scanning probe microscopies, and optical, thermal, mechanical, scattering and diffraction methods. The course will provide a balanced mix of physical principles, application considerations, and practical examples of the characterization methods. For CHEM students and students with instructor's approval only",
