Annotations on the PowerPoint made things easier to understand. Meanwhile, he was so attentive to the chatbox and addressed those questions during the lecture. It was nice to see he held three additional tutorials to explain some difficult concepts in the graded quiz and demonstrated a past exam question to us. He also shared to us the approach in visualizing a complicated question<br /><br />❌ All lectures were compulsory to attend and attendance contributed into the final grade. He made polling during the lecture to test our understanding and also served as a purpose of taking attendance.<br /><br />❌ This was the first time for him to teach this course. Therefore, there were many typos and amendments to the lecture notes. This was quite inconvenience if you use printed lecture notes.<br /><br />✅ Three TAs held the tutorials, and they were all responsible and handled the sessions with care. They would respond to the chat room frequently and waited for a few minutes after the tutorial sessions to answer additional questions. It was quite easy to reach him through email, as they responded to the emails quickly and gave a detailed, useful explanation. Tutorial materials were helpful, but the graded quiz and final exam were more complicated.<br /><br />❌ I would say sometimes those TAs spoke too fast, so I was not able to follow them during the tutorial.",

Moreover, we had to prepare for three graded quizzes throughout the semester, which was very demanding to us. It was controversial that professor refused to offer us a single midterm. If you want to get a good grade, you may need to spend much time in understanding the course materials completely and do every example by hand. <br /><br />Optional problem sets were given, but no answer provided. It may be helpful to take a look and slightly think about them so you would not cry in graded quizzes and final exam.",

Design principles under Ultimate Limit States ULS<br />2. Flexural Design for beams (simple beams &amp; flange beams)<br />3. Shear Design for beams, torsion, bond, anchorage &amp; lap<br />4. Serviceability Limit State SLS <br />5. Comprehensive Design for beams <br />6. One-way &amp; two-way slab design, load transfer mechanism, punching shear of slabs <br />7. Column design (braced &amp; unbraced column design under axial, bi-axial and bending) <br />8. (Optional) Design of R.C joints <br /><br />Every lecture notes covered design methodologies, concepts, references from code of practices and examples. Extra annotations and explanations are made during lectures.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching team has tried their very best to make the very first structural design course comprehensible for students and I have to appreciate the efforts made by the professor and TAs. <br /><br />Ilias prepared all the lecture notes comprehensively with reference to the notes prepared by Prof JS Kuang, textbooks, HK Code of Practice on Structural Concrete Design &amp; BS 8110. The notes comprise with design principles, methodologies, structural failure mechanisms, tables and examples. At the first glance, the content are complex and demanding, but the explanations during lectures are illustrative. The lecture polling questions encourage students to pay attention to the lecture explanations and think from what have been covered so far. <br /><br />The 6 TAs have respectively in-charge of the tutorials that they are responsible of, the tutorial covered a brief review of the lecture content, then continued by more comprehensive and complex examples and practices that the lecture notes didn't cover so far. The tutorial notes are very useful as you will see the TAs efforts to give you a grand picture of how concrete design works in practice. You may easily mess up the contents and details of the tutorial notes due to the rigorous rules and limitations governed by the Code of Practice (e.g. selections of steels, stirrups, calculation steps, reinforcement arrangements, preliminary design etc.) , while decision making is the key component for concrete design, so personally I approached to the TAs through email to seek for more clarifications. The TAs have given a detail reply and illustration very quickly. Due to the tons of technical questions flying all over everyone's head, the TAs have prepared a detail FAQs list on Canvas and a discussion forum is made for resolving any potential issues. <br /><br />Two TAs were in-charge of the laboratory session. This year the COVID situation was slightly under controlled and on-campus lab sessions were compulsory. Students should sign up the time-slot accordingly and prepared both under-reinforced and over-reinforced beam specimens by tying up the steel bars, stirrups and preparing fresh concrete (just like what you did in PolyU IC Training). After strength development a month later, students are required to conduct several specimens testing and reviewed the data collected. A detail checklist on the questions to be written on the laboratory report is given accordingly. The lab report is a group one with around 12 students in a group, and students are given two weeks to complete so.",

Print out all the notes, tables, calculation steps that you need, checking all the details on the computer is just a waste of time. <br /><br />My grade for your reference:<br />Attendance (by answering all the poll questions) 10/10<br /><br />Assignments &amp; Lab Report 16.54/20 <br />(yes the mean for assignments are just around 80, and for the slab &amp; column assignment is just 70, lab around 90, and man I was fucked by the tedious works and steps in assignments) <br /><br />Quizzes * 3<br />Quiz 1 (Flexural Design of beam)&nbsp;&nbsp;89/100 <br />Quiz 2 (Shear Design of beam &amp; SLS) 93/100 <br />(due to errors made by the professor, most students have their score adjusted accordingly) <br />Quiz 3 (Slab Design &amp; Load Transfer) 91/100 <br />Choose the best 2 quizzes 91, 93 --&gt; take average 92 --&gt; 27.6/30<br /><br />Final (comprehensive design problem on slab, load transfer, beam and column) <br />87/100 --&gt; 34.8/40 (=1SD)<br /><br />Overall 88.94% <br />Grade: A- <br />I would say the grading is quite competitive and disappointing for me, just because many have similar scores in quizzes/exam, as such the professor should have followed a strict grade distribution.<br /><br />** We didn't receive any statistics for Quiz 3.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is very high I have to tell you the truth. Even 學霸 &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;學弱 feel like the course is very troublesome. If you don't revise frequently and in great detail with all the notes, textbooks, codes and past source problems, and don't even seek help from the TAs, you will no sooner find yourself lagging behind the schedule when assignments, tutorials, quizzes and lab reports flying all over your dickhead while you damn useless pig lab groupmates made you angry when they failed to make contributive work on the lab report, and then suddenly 鋪頭 &amp; 叫春話人吾出聲吾比題目人做 at the very last minute of the report submission. <br /><br />Assignments are very tedious and you need to debug and review the steps all the time to ensure the design logic shown are clear. You know the TAs marked the assignments in a very strict manner (especially the first two and final assignment you will need to spend hours of time revisit the notes, think of the questions and answering tactics that you have never encountered in tutorials, and work on the problems for hours and days --- Fuck My Life :)) <br /><br />For quizzes, I recommend you to better revise as early as possible by looking up all the design steps from lectures, tutorials, assignment solution keys, and maybe you find some more practice problems from sources to make sure you are well-equipped to work on the tedious steps within very limited time. I have to tell you that the teaching team intentionally made the assignments and quizzes comprise with different values on loads &amp; dimensions where students are unable to copy the exact design values from one another, and all they care about is your design LOGIC to show the design steps very clear with complete illustrations of reinforcement and cross-section drawings, not the exact numbers you have calculated. Even the values you worked on are wrong, but if you are able to show your work comprehensively, you can still get high marks trust me. <br /><br />The Final is troublesome, I turned out work on a total of 30 pages of design work within 3 hours. The steps are very clumsy. <br /><br />I suggest you to work on the self-practice given on Canvas or looked up the past exam/assignment questions and worked all by hand to make sure that you really know the methodologies. I see someone who had posted last year quizzes problem and final questions right here and I really think those are very useful practice. <br /><br />Don't give up btw, I know it is hard, but hard work really pays off for this course and the complexity of this course is not the one you have experienced from Ghidaoui, and I think such practice can help you prepare for the following Steel Design Course that most of us will be taking as a CIVL elective (from past experience over 100 students take the Steel Design Course --&gt; saying this is a &quot;Compulsory&quot; course should be the truth), and maybe if you want to get well-prepared for future job interview, the knowledge gained should be useful for solving different technical questions.",
