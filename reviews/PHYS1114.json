First, according to UST SPACE, there are MCQs in the previous semesters, but there are only few in this semester. Instead, the exam is full of lots of numeric questions and require you to react fast and be very careful. Second, the exam is one attempt for each question and only display a question in each time. You cannot skip or guess and then return back to do it later. Professor thinks we should be genius to figure out the method and find the answer in 4 minutes in average. To show his lenient and considerate, he let us have an open book test. Open-book so what? There's no enough time for you to open book lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have once discussed heatedly on canvas, and professor replied that even TOEFL and SAT have the one-attempt rule. Hello? Are you kidding me? Or do you think that no one has taken TOEFL before? The reading test in IBT could turn back in a singular question group. The exam rules would only make the talented students get higher grades, or maybe even forcing some students to cheat smh.<br />Overall, the experience sucks.",

            "comment_content": "The course mainly covers Chapter 21 to 36 of the textbook, Sears &amp; Zemansky's University Physics with Modern Physics (14th edition, by Young and Freedman). Topics covered include:<br /><br />Chapter 21. Electric Force and Electric Field<br />Chapter 22. Gauss Law<br />Chapter 23. Electric Potential and Electric Potential Energy<br />Chapter 24. Capacitor and Dielectrics<br />Chapter 25. Current, Resistance and Voltage<br />Chapter 26. Kirchhoff's Laws of Circuit and RC circuits<br />Chapter 27. Magnetic Field and Magnetic Force<br />Chapter 28. Sources of Magnetic Field<br />Chapter 29. Electromagnetic Induction<br />Chapter 30. Inductor<br />Chapter 31. LRC circuit with an AC power supply<br />Chapter 32. Light as an Electromagnetic Wave<br />Chapter 33. Polarization and Scattering<br />Chapter 35. Young's Double Slit Interference and Thin Film Interference<br />Chapter 36. Single Slit and Multiple Slit Diffraction, Diffraction Grating and Rayleigh Criterion<br /><br />[Remark: Chapter 34 is not covered in this semester.]<br /><br />Comments:<br />The content is almost the same (perhaps slightly more than) that covered in former HKALE Physics. While some of the topics (such as the magnetic field produced by an infinite straight wire, Ohm's Law, etc.) have already been covered in HKDSE Physics, the same formulas and concepts are introduced in a slightly more rigorous and logical way. Some concepts are even redefined or reformulated using the language of vector operations. Thus, DO NOT simply skip the materials because you have learnt them in high school.<br /><br />Moreover, since the course content is almost identical to the former HKALE Physics, and midterm and finals are all MCs, I feel that doing HKALE Physics MC past paper by topics is a better way of studying than doing textbook exercises. (While the midterm and final covers a greater range of difficulty than HKALE Physics, you can get about 80% of the score in midterm and final if you can do and understand most HKALE Physics MCQs.)",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Leung's teaching is excellent. I can basically understand most, if not all, the concepts taught in lectures without much difficulty, and this greatly reduces my time for self-studying and revising after lectures. <br /><br />The TA is also great. First, she prepares a 4-slide summary for each and every chapter for each tutorial. Her summary contains useful formulas, making it a good reference for doing Mastering Physics as well as preparing for exams. (Since different TAs are responsible for different tutorial sessions, the above comment is only applicable for the TA in my session.)",

While (for me) it takes around 2 hours to finish each assignment, as they can really consolidate what you should know for each chapter, you basically need not do much extra practice after finishing the Mastering Physics assignment. So the assignment turns out to save you time in doing extra exercise.",

However, I recommend you to really grasp the concept since those will most likely make it to the test.<br /><br />For my tutorial, I got Wing Hong FUNG as my TA. Personally, I like his explanation A LOT more than the professor's. His writing is very neat and clean and his accent is easy to listen to.

The classes were interesting and rich in content, but the concepts require time to digest, not to mention absorbing and mastering it. So to attain a good grade, you have to spend more time comprehending the theories and making it appear to be physically intuitive to you.<br /><br />In this course, various mathematical techniques will be introduced, though they were not in the exam. Apart from basic integration and differentiation, the professor will briefly teach about line integrals, phasor diagrams, complex planes and partial derivatives. Mathematical abilities and theories are not emphasized in this course, so these do not commonly show up in the exam. However, understanding the derivation is very good for learning the concepts.",

            "comment_content": "E&amp;M and optics. Both of them are very difficult topics. However, both the midterm and final exam is set rather easy. If you finish all the HW understanding everything, you'll get a pretty good score.<br /> It helps to have PHYS1112 background since L-R-C circuit is similar to SHM but for most other topics, you can take PHYS1114 without PHYS1112 but only do so if you're ok with calculus and interested in E&amp;M. You need not worry about L-R-C circuit too much as the problems in the exam about LRC is relatively simple, mostly conceptual problems with not much calculations.<br />My advice for people who want to take this course is to actually finish all homework on your own. It's going to take some time. I know some people who get sources and try to finish the HW. This way is not going to work unless you have the ability to finish the HW on your own, otherwise, seek help from TA or your classmates and make sure you understand every question in the problem set before proceeding. Then, you'll find PHYS1114 much more manageable. Don't let things build up or I can imagine students getting frustrated.",
            "comment_teaching": "I don't know about the teaching quality of lecture well because I only attended the first lecture, but it's definitely far from perfect (that's why I didn't attend any other lectures).<br /><br />However, I can say that the tutorial is really really bad. Not only does the TA has an incomprehensible accent, always saying &quot;to calculating ...., .....&quot;. However, you're forced to attend tutorial so it's really painful. The T.A. doesn't explain the concept well and it's a total waste of time to go to the tutorial.<br /><br />I recommend the 8.02 lecture series by the legendary professor Walter Lewin. It's of superb quality compared to my lecturer. I<br />m basically only watching his videos to learn about LRC, melaus law, brewsters angle and polarisers. You can also consider watching lecture videos by Dr. Cheung Man Fung. I looked at some of the videos and find them pretty good as well.",

            "comment_workload": "I don't understand why A has to mean &quot;very light workload&quot;. For me, A means &quot;the workload prepares you for learning more&quot;. This is certainly the case for PHYS1114. The workload is among one of the highest in introductory courses but it's also rewarding.<br /><br />Also, although the content in PHYS1114 is very hard and admittedly I don't understand all the derivations of formulas before the final exam. However, the questions appearing in the exam is rather straightforward so you don't need to be too worries about the exam if you can finish the HW. I also recommend trying the supplementary problem, granted I only finish the first 5 sets.",

            "comment_content": "To give some background information, I am a year one student, coming from A Levels exam, I had my PHYS1112 transferred already, which is why I came directly to 1114. <br /><br />After studying for a semester, looking back, it isn't really that hard. Maybe it's because I had A Levels background, I've heard of most of the stuff, which makes it a little easier for me. However, it is not easy whatsoever. There are many equations to memorise, which wasn't a lot of fun.<br /><br />I won't be studying physics in the future (should be maths for me), so I think this is a bit above my level. For people studying a physics major, this should be a standard basic required course.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say, just a standard university physics course.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor has decent English and explains stuff well, but it's best to prepare a little before lectures. That was my mistake, I got lost on multiple occasions. <br /><br />One funny thing though, the professor always talks about integration in lectures, but actually, THERE IS NO NEED FOR INTEGRATION (95% of the time). Most of the integrations are just proof for the actual useful equation. If you are to study a physics major, those might be useful for you, but for me, not at all. <br /><br />I skipped all the tutorials, the dude had really bad English, and it was basically doing exercises with us, which I could accomplish by doing assignments myself. Personally, I don't think the tutorials are necessary.",

            "comment_teaching": "Professor ZHANG had prepared his own notes before the lectures started. Thus, I could follow the progress of the lectures easily in most of the time. If I couldn't follow, I watched the playback of the video twice or three times. Had I not attended his lectures, I would have struggled a lot.<br /><br />He held additional, regular zoom meetings from 4 pm to 5 pm on Friday. When the time was near the final exam, he reserved the normal lectures' time for us to ask him questions related to Physics. I asked him some questions about the lectures and he helped me a lot in understanding the topic more. <br /><br />I thought the tutorials held by the TAs were fine. However, if I had problems, I generally asked the professor instead of the TA.<br /><br />I genuinely recommend professor ZHANG as your lecturer.",

I spent quite a lot of time in this course because the content was quite difficult for a year one student like me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I normally used the weekends to complete the assignments which contained around 10 questions each.<br /><br />If you have any problems related to the assignments, you can ask the TAs in the tutorial sessions. In this term, they quickly recapped some basic but important concepts which had been taught in the lectures and some time in the tutorial sessions were used to help you to tackle some difficult questions which appeared in the assignments.",

Reasonable difficulty for year 1/ 2 engineering/ physics students.<br /><br />The course is not math-intensive, there is very few occasion that we need to do complicated integration.<br /><br />But you should understand the symbol and meaning of vector, dot product, cross product, surface integrals and line integrals because they appear in the maxwell equations. <br /><br />We don't have to actually evaluate those weird integrals because all the problem in this course is symmetrical (circle, sphere, cylindrical)<br /><br />The syllabus skipped some hard parts like Poynting Vector, Oscillating Charges to generate EM wave, and Radiation Pressure, I think they take away those concepts and will teach them at the higher-level course.",

Some of them can still be described without calculus in one way or another but there are contents that will unavoidably apply M2. It would be best if you can understand it the hard way, but it is not necessary.<br /><br />From other reviews, this course is not required by many majors in both SSCI and SENG (only a few of them actually need this course).

So, we could not guess the questions (which are harder) and evidently lower mean (11/24 in midterm and 13/36)<br /><br />Second, no going back policy, we could go back to the previous question once we moved on. With the monitoring on Zoom, students should not have that much ease to communicate with others and divide the work if the policy is absent. <br /><br />Welp, dunno what the profs think.

            "comment_content": "Since the content is basically the same as those in past years, here I would like to comment on the experience arrangements in this course conducted online in more detail.<br /><br />As said in the title, it is quite frankly a disappointment. Many of our us did not complain in the final exam of 2019-20 Fall, because we are either trying to familiarize ourselves with the arrangements, or did not have the chance to do so. I personally find it inconvenient and unfair compared to those taking this course in future or past years, given the online arrangement seals many of the exam strategies, forcing us to do the test question-by-question. More than 1/5 of the students have tried to reason with the instructors on Canvas, and this is their response:<br /><br />&quot;Dear all,<br /><br />You may have noticed the heated discussion among some of your fellow students on Canvas, and even received email on the related topic. We believe we should explain our stance and&nbsp;&nbsp;the rationale behind it.<br /><br />The obvious reason is to make cheating difficult. Not that we assume every student would cheat, but you certainly will feel uncomfortable if people around you cheat easily. In our current online setting, there is no single method that can stop cheating completely. That's why we need to implement various rules, including scrambling question order, choices, and numbers, etc. The no-going-back rule is just one of them. Cheating cannot easily be prevented by simply pointing camera to the screen. You certainly don't want everyone to look at your screen while you enter your answer. <br /><br />On the other hand, we fully understand that the no-going-back rule may create additional stress to some students. In respect to those concerns, we have adopted several adjustments to the exam, aiming to ease the stress you may have . Compared to previous terms, we have made the exam open-book (we believe you welcome this) with the same difficulty level as that in closed-book exam, and reduced the number of problems from 30 to 24, to give you extra time on each question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we will announce not only the total number of questions, but also the number of MCs and non-MCs. We are trying hard to strike a balance between reducing your stress and fencing off academic dishonesty. Some may not like the rule, but the same rule is uniformly applied to each of your 270 fellow students. It is a rule to practice fairness for all students, rather than to target any individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;By implementing multiple rules, we strive to give our students the confidence that the score each student receive is commensurate to their understanding of the physics by making effort, instead of otherwise. All you need to do is to try your best! <br /><br />Finally, we would like to remark that many standardized tests, such as SAT, TOEFL and GRE, have this no-going-back rule. You better be aware of it if you need to take these exams in the future.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />All instructors of PHYS 1114&quot;<br /><br />The instructors have made clear that they are intent on preventing anyone from cheating using this method. I'm not saying this is a reckless decision, but they should also consider students' situations as well. Under the rule, many of us can no longer do the same things as we did in a paper examination, such as skipping or double-checking. It can be inconvenient for us during calculation. They should try putting themselves in our shoes instead of going their own ways.<br /><br />My final message is that, if you are not trying to fulfill your major requirements, I'd suggest taking this course at a later time (i.e. when the pandemic is over) for a more justified arrangement. It is not a fair game for students as a whole when it is changed online. If you are intent on eliminating any cheating, there is one way I could suggest for all courses whereas possible: change the final exam into a final assignment, so nobody has to worry about anything.",
            "comment_teaching": "Not bad, but not great either. Maybe because of online teaching, it is difficult for instructors to explain theorems and formulas in more detail without whiteboard, and they can only scroll PDFs during lectures.<br /><br />As for tutorial, while the tutor would give us time to complete questions one-by-one then explain, his English is quite incomprehensible, making it very hard to listen.",

            "comment_content": "The content is pretty difficult if you don't have a decent grasp over calculus and physics concepts from PHYS1112. Easy to understand if you are good at calculus and have done high school physics but it's still important to study the proofs.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Chen understands the concepts well and his explanations are thorough. He explains the calculus proofs for everything but he can be very boring. The class is interesting when he does live demos for some concepts but rarely. <br /><br />The tutor is also very knowledgeable and answers all questions satisfactorily.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is very lenient. Here is the breakdown: <br /><br />Assignments\t10%<br />Midterm Exam\t35%<br />Final Exam\t55%<br /><br />Final exam can be much harder than the midterm but you should be fine as long as you do the homework from mastering physics.",
            "comment_workload": "One piece of homework every week from mastering physics. On average takes 1.5-3hrs to complete. Many answers can be found on Google so you can save time like that but the questions are good for practice. If you can do the homework yourself, you're equipped well for the exams.",

Please check which ones are omitted/included). <br /><br />I recommend reading the course reference (University Physics by Freedman) and Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday. Interested students can also read Electricity and Magnetism by Purcell (some problems are good, but some other problems toward the end, which seems to be added later on by the second writer, are infuriating to read + strangely worded, and seems to be made by a non-physicist.) or Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths for fun. However, the two references mentioned in the beginning should be more than enough.",
            "comment_teaching": "Overall the teaching was ok. <br /><br />The professor does address all the course syllabus and which ones are to be excluded for the semester. He may also note whether the contents in his lecture notes will appear in the exams. However, attending the lectures was very inefficient as professor Leung spent most of the time (including the lecture notes) solving examples/talking about contents directly copied from the textbook. <br /><br />Professor Leung does not give adequate explanations. For instance, he mentioned the direction of a field is uniquely defined by symmetry, but he does not explain why it is so. The concept is in fact abstract and not that intuitive after all. In such cases, it is a good idea to ask questions immediately, as there can be too many people asking the professor after the class.<br /><br />As a side note, he seems to believe in the survival of the fittest. To quote &quot;Do not sit next to people who cannot answer your question&quot;.",
            "comment_grading": "Fair.<br /><br />Final is 60 percent, Mid-Term is 30 percent, and the Webwork is 10 percent of the total grade. <br /><br />In this semester, Mid-Term can be relatively easy just by comprehensively studying the course reference (Though I only read Purcell and Griffiths. But as I said, Freedman/Halliday alone is more than enough for this course). <br /><br />Final had about 5 questions directly copied from the tutorial work. One can attain an above average grade (A+ range) if he/she has a solid foundation. I have been told that the Final was somewhat difficult for students who have not studied physics prior to taking this class.",
            "comment_workload": "The only assignments are Webwork. However, it is suggested that students study regularly if they have not sufficiently learned general physics prior to taking the class. Attendance is not a mandatory, but the tutorials are very helpful. Depending on the difficulty of the exams, chances are, one may encounter identical/similar questions from the tutorial sessions.",

Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1314. This course employs a calculus‚Äêbased approach. Key topics include <br />Coulomb‚Äôs law<br />electric field and potential<br />Gauss‚Äôs law<br />capacitance<br />circuits<br />magnetic force and field<br />Ampere‚Äôs law,<br />electromagnetic induction<br />AC circuit<br />Maxwell‚Äôs equations<br />electromagnetic waves<br />wave optics<br />interference and diffraction<br /><br />The sequential order is good. When a new formula is introduced, it is backed by the knowledge in previous chapters. For example, you can see that Gauss's law appears many times throughout the course materials.<br />However, in practice when you do the exam questions, it is quite easy to identify which chapter is related and which formulas should be used. There is little crossover between different topics.",

He explains the knowledge clearly and effectively(he used his own way to explain EM wave as he thought the notes are not good enough, his attitude should be appreciated here).<br />He knows the exam-oriented mindset of many of us, so he would remind us when there is something important for midterm and final (and provide recipes). <br />He has video demonstrations in class(what i remember the most is about ig Nobel prize...).<br />His accent is quite good.",

Yet ,there are some difficult topics challenging us, like EM induction, light polarization, and application of interference and diffraction on double/single-slit experiment, everything in this course is manageable. Students who took Physics and M2 should be able to handle this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Tsui is the best professor I've ever met in HKUST. Her teaching is very good. The lecture slides she made is very detailed and understandable. And she is far beyond is the audio version of PowerPoint slides. She explains every concept clearly and does illustration in a comprehensive manner. We only need to pay attention to her and then can understand what she talks about. Even if you can't get what she says immediately, you can ask her questions or go through the lecture video. There isn't an issue for anyone to understand her words. In addition, she has a high English proficiency. She is almost one of the local professors with the best English standard. She speaks fluently and seldom makes pronunciation mistakes. This does facilitate us to understand the lecture content a lot as we are more willing to listen to her.<br />Furthermore, Prof. Tsui is very nice with a very good personality. She always asks &quot;Is there any problem?&quot;. It may sound dull but she is really making sure we all understand what she talks about. She is well-prepared to answer our questions. In this online semester, we don't hesitate to interrupt her to ask her questions. She gives us a very detailed reply with a smile on her face. Then our problem gets addressed. During a lecture before the mid-term, upon a request made by a student, she didn't mind reviewing the syllabus instead of continuing the new topic. Once, she even went through light polarization and interference in thin films which were difficult and she didn't deem she had explained well once again.<br />Not many professors are like Prof. Tsui. She is a nice, passionate, caring and heart-endearing professor. She prioritizes the learning need of students rather than rushing lecture materials, to make sure every single student can learn well. I hope that her classroom can be full of students. Prof. Tsui, you deserve good comments from students!",

It is fine you can't get the correct answer.<br /><br />The grading system is reasonable. I don't find that it kills our grade. And I have to say Prof. Tsui isn't a grade killer or god. You need to work hard to get a good grade.",
            "comment_workload": "For me, the workload for this course isn't heavy. I don't know if it is because I only took 1 course in summer. But I think the workload still isn't too heavy in fall or spring term. We just need to do 1 set of assignment every week. The assignment takes around 1-2 hours. And we only need to do some revision, exercises and past papers to prepare for exams. As long as you pay attention to lectures, do assignments and exercises for revision, it isn't difficult for you to get a good grade in this course. The workload is surely reasonable for this course.",
