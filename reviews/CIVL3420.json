Wastewater treatment (biological process)<br />4. Sludge disposal<br /><br />The topics are very standard materials which covers the basics of water treatment processes.Compared to other civil courses, this course need more chemistry rather than maths. All the calculations are just plugging in numbers based on the equation derived. The hardest part is the mass balance using CFSTR model. There will be many equations coming out which may be confusing.Besides, this is not a broad base course like 2410 so this will be easier to follow up.<br /><br />This is a required course for CIEV students and there are also some CEEV students taking taking this course, but overall the number of students taking this course is less than 20.",
            "comment_teaching": "This a lab-based course,but due to the pandemic the lab session is conducted in Zoom tutorial which makes things troublesome.Imagine how frustrating it is on watching the color change of the indicator using a 144p&nbsp;&nbsp;recording&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply a must but also a non sense to google what is the lab doing after the session. Why I need to waste f**king 10 hours on watching this stuff?<br /><br />On top of that , the lab technician is the actual course coordinator ans he is in charge for the labs , assignments and also the final. He is also in charge for teaching nearly half of the course. To be honest, his teaching is a bit boring but at least he is responsive to the emails and his explanations are quite good.<br /><br />For professor Wu, I think his teaching is just fine.",

Perhaps this is because of the small class size.",
            "comment_workload": "Quite low compared to other 3000-level CIVL courses ( but still substantial)<br /><br />The homework is just an exercise on how to plugging in numbers<br /><br />However,the all lab reports need 2-3 days to finish them, since students are asked to do the 8-10 page report IN PERSON.",
