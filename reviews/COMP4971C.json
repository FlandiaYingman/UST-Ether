Towards an Inclusive Community of Undergraduate Physicists<br />(TiCuP) and Princeton Society of Physics Students (PSPS) have come together to demystify course selection and the physics and astrophysics majors. Drawing on the wisdom and experi- ence of past, current, and prospective majors, we are here to help you overcome any confusion or academic unsureness and guide you through your first years at Princeton.<br />After working hard in high school, it may seem like the only viable path to a challenging major such as physics or astrophysics is to take the hardest, most advanced courses as early as possible. The goal of<br />this guide is to convince you that this is not the case. Just as there are a plethora of research fields within physics and astrophysics (atomic physics, cosmology, biophysics, nanotechnology, etc.), there are a plethora of ways to pursue the physics and astrophysics majors.
