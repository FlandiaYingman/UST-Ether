        "description": "This course combines theoretical training with practical applications. It introduces students to key concepts in the discipline of public management and covers major approaches to management in the public sector. The course begins with a review of the evolution of thinking from public administration to public management. It allows students to explore the changes of responsibilities and skills of public managers. From that basis, we move to look at tools in important functional areas of public management and investigate how to critically apply a range of mechanisms to improve the performance of public managers.",
