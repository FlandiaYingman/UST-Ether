The course content is presented in a series of bullet points on PowerPoint slides, and the professor provides additional examples during lectures. Although the calculations presented in class may be complex in real-world scenarios, the course only covers a simplified version. While the course material is not particularly difficult, it may require some extra time and effort to fully grasp the underlying concepts.",
            "comment_grading": "1.In-class exercises (20%) (iprs )<br />2 group projects (20%) related to Project <br />3. A Final exam (60%)(2 hrs)<br />The in-class exercises for this course include IPRs and some calculation questions. These exercises are used mainly for attendance purposes, so you don't need to answer all questions correctly. For the calculation questions, the answers are provided after class.<br /><br />The group project requires you to research a topic related to the course and present it to your classmates in a 25-30 minute PowerPoint presentation. There is no need to write a report for the project.<br /><br />The final exam consists of calculation questions only, which are similar to the homework but require more detailed calculations. The exam is open-book, but you will need to print out all your notes. Professor Zhang has stated that all students will receive at least a B+ grade unless they skip most classes or fail to complete the presentation and final exam. In the end, I received an A grade, which is a very good result.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this class is quite light since there are no homework assignments or in-class exercises to prepare for. Instead, you only have to complete one open book exam and give one presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorizing the course concepts is not necessary. You just need to write down the calculation steps in you notes and bring them to the exam. As long as you do this, you can expect to receive a good grade.",
