        "description": "The first half of a final-year project course offers practice of chemical engineering design through a group design project chosen to integrate materials covered in the curriculum. Students will complete a comprehensive review of the project background, technical literature and the patent landscape. They will propose an overall design (e.g. material and energy balance) and experimental methods (if applicable). Students need to substantiate the design feasibility with initial results in the written reports and oral presentations. For students in Chemical Engineering, Chemical and Environmental Engineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Instructor's approval is required.",
