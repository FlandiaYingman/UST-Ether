        "description": "In this course, we will discuss some geometric and analytic problems related to Mathematical General Relativity. We will begin with a short discussion on Lorentz manifolds. Then we will discuss the Einstein field equation, materials related to the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equation. Then we will discuss the concept of energy and mass of an isolated system, positive mass theorems, the concept of quasilocal mass and their geometric applications. Students taking this course are assumed to have basic knowledge in Riemannian geometry and elliptic partial differential equations.",
