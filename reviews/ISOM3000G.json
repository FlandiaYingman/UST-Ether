So many errors and cant solve, really really tiring, and lose many hair.<br /><br />For individual assignments, not that hard (as long as you spend more time to google, you will be able to finish it ;P) <br />P.S. Use L jor 2 full days to do one assignment. I am programming rubbish ;)",

As Kotlin is said to be an easier version of Java, you will certainly have an advantage if you have Java background.",

Even if not, he always welcome students to ask him questions. <br /><br />TA Samuel is nice and have much programming knowledge, but not organised. He claims that he is not sure how he should set the difficulty of the assignment so he delays the release until end of Nov...Android studio sometimes got bug and errors that Samuel cannot solve as well.",

It may seem that the workload is just a normal 3-cred course, but they are just not organised... <br /><br />Need to attend class for in-class ex, but as long as you submit some work you will get the point.<br /><br />Project and assignments were shit. Since both require all the knowledge taught in the course in order to be able to finish, the assignments were released towards the end of the semester. We only got less than a week to finish, and it is NOT simple, not to say we have to do the project and revise for finals.<br /><br />I have to admit our group started the project not the earliest which made us a little rush. It is also harder than we thought and even all the knowledge taught in class is not enough. <br /><br />So in the end during the revision break before finals, I spent like 12 hours+ each day for the whole week on 3000G...",
