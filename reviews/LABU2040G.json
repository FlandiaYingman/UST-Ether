        "description": "This course seeks to equip students with persuasive communication skills, both oral and written, through analyzing business cases and presenting solutions to problems identified. It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement.",

Around 80% of mine is very good and 20% is competent. But out of my expectation, the final grade is A.<br /><br />A small reminder: Make sure you follow everything he says (PPT Slide, presentation structure, the recommendation report, and the learning portfolio) and you would get an A-range grade.",

Cases are around 15-20 pages long. <br /><br />No homework/ take-home assignments in general, only one recommendation report. Levi would give you time in class to work on that. If you want to polish the essay but don't have enough time in class, you might need to spend some extra time working on it. <br /><br />There are presentations, and you have time to prepare the ppt slides together with your groupmates in class (Levi would offer you suggestions in the meantime). You can also prepare scripts in class so no extra work is needed outside the classroom. However, if your group wants to do rehearsal beforehand (which is recommended), there would not be enough time in class.",

And on the fun side, he sends out weekly emails recommending music he enjoys listening to!",
