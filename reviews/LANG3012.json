Basically covers the important aspects of writing a professional lab report: Intro, experimental, discussions and conclusion. Lecture materials are well designed and examples given are very helpful. Common language errors made by non-native speakers are highlighted, and I cannot stress how useful they are to improving my English, We also have two consultation sessions where we get feedback from our reports, and these are beneficial too.",

She also highlights the common grammatical or colloquial mistakes that students in HK tend to make, and I find that so useful that when I take Lang 4012, I still refer to the lecture notes from this course. And the overall atmosphere was amazing, and lets face it, listening to perfect English by a native speaker is just amazing!!!<br />To me personally, Rebecca is the best instructor I have ever had!",
