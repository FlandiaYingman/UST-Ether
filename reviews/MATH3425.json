If you are into the quant industry, knowing how to calculate those expected value is extremely helpful for your interview.

How many expected coin toss do you need to throw to see the pattern 'HHT' for the first time?<br />Eg2. I have 3 coins you have 4 coins.

I simple do not think that it is possible to do all the questions so quickly with high accuracy.<br /><br />For the final part, most of the questions come directly from the LALA system (DIY part), so you could print out all the DIY questions as no limit on cheat sheet and try to find the corresponding questions during the exam. <br /><br /><br />Grading scheme:<br />50% Homework (LALA)<br />50% Final<br /><br />LALA:<br />0 87.79 93.38 96.77 98.56 | 93.87<br />Final:<br />18 54.75 69.5 85.25 100 | 86<br /><br />Final Grade: A-<br /><br />Remarks:<br />Getting an A- with my final's score barely above UQ is unexpected. <br /><br />Just buy sources to secure your grade, since final is also basically hw questions.
