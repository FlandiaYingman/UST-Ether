In this course, though, I don't want to criticize her teaching performance as it was very similar to that during her ISOM2500 (except that there were no participation cards), but it seems that the content was too difficult that no matter how she explained, I still couldn't understand much.

Final is all long questions and some of them are quite mathematical, e.g. covering linear algebra topics requiring you to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors... I bet almost nobody knows how to do those questions...)<br /><br />Update:<br />Much to my surprise, the grading is unexpectedly lenient.<br />For me:<br />Assignment 1: 98/120 (mean: 100.9)<br />Assignment 2: 96/120 (mean: 109.6, SD: 6.07)<br />Assignment 3: 100/100 (mean: 90)<br />Case study: 88/100 (mean: 86.1)<br />Midterm: 57/100 (mean: 71.56, SD: 12.61) (the score had been scaled up a bit as told by the TA)<br />Final: 65/100 (mean: 71.1, SD: 14.8)<br /><br />And it turns out I get a B+!
