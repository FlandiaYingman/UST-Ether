        "description": "Mask is a magical, artistic tool that unites imagination, body, feeling and thinking. Mask theater is a genre in theater which is tightly used in exploring human nature. In mask theater, actors put on masks not just to exaggerate their facial expressions, but to get in touch with the mental and spiritual exploration of human being. In this course, students will learn the basic principles, knowledge and skills of mask and mask theater through games, exercises and creative process. They will explore the personal and social dimensions of human nature through the use of masks. Based on the pedagogy of the French actor and educator Jacques Lecoq, various types of masks and mask performances will be introduced. Students will explore and perform with various types of masks throughout the course. Eventually, they will create their own mask performance.",
