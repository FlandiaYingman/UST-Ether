            "comment_content": "Only about 40% of the course content is covered by shell/bash scripting and Unix OS architecture, which was pretty disappointing. Rest of it consists of programming in Perl. Perl is a bit of a dying language, but is still a great tool when it comes to text processing and several other things. Nevertheless, the course content is pretty well organized and especially if you have prior programming experience, is easy to follow. The programming level is not too high and those who have at least finished the 1XXX COMP courses without struggling too much would find it easy.<br /><br />EDIT: It has been a year since I took the course and I still return to Perl and the things we were taught on a regular basis. Perl is not great for larger projects but it has this hacky charm where you can write practical scripts merely in a line or two and with great bash integration. E.g. I used the things I learnt to periodically scrape my course websites to fetch lecture materials automatically. Also I made the switch to using a GNU/Linux based OS full time without Windows.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor is pretty good, explains all the concepts well and attempts to crack jokes in class from time to time(although sad to say, the students rarely laughed). Not her fault but the nature of the content is often dry and there's not much that can be done.",
            "comment_grading": "A surprisingly high number of final year and exchange students in this course, a lot of them don't pay much attention to the material, and do it for fun. This makes the environment a little less serious and giving more opportunity to learn. Even as a first year student, it was not difficult to keep up.",
            "comment_workload": "There is a group project that is very important to grading and only one 'midterm' that was conducted at the last week of the semester with no final exam. Make a project that appeals to the other students and it is easy to get their votes, even if it doesn't really target the core points of Unix/Linux programming. There are also assessed lab/assignments to be handed in every week which count for the grade",

Quite a lot of people (year 1 to year 4 students) in the class already have some knowledge about the course, so do not expect a low mean.<br /><br />Assignment is very important if you want to get A/A+, as the mean and SD of project and final exam are pretty high.
