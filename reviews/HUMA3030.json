            "comment_content": "雖然係3000-level course, 但讀既野唔係真係咁難<br /><br />10 Modules:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. The Meaning of Meaning<br />3. Cooperative Principle and Conversational Implicature<br />4. Advanced Topics on Entailment, Presupposition, and Implicature<br />5. Interim Topic 1: Language Tricks – Case Studies<br />6. Interim Topic 2: Language as a Complex Communication System: Its Design Features &amp; Uniqueness<br />7. Speech Acts: How to Do Things with Words<br />8. Speech Act: Advanced Topics<br />9. Indirect Speech Act<br />10. Linguistic Politeness<br /><br />呢個course主要研究human language既特點, 例如簡單一句 &quot;It's raining outside!&quot; 可以有幾多種意思?可以係佢字面意思(literal meaning): 出面落緊雨, 仲可以有無限多既隱含意思(implicit meanings), 例如有個主人同個客人咁樣講, 佢可以係暗示客人留多陣先走, 又或者叫客人快D返屋企<br /><br />上半部分 (Modules 2-4) 屬於語義學(Semantics), 主要講3種implicit meanings: entailment, presupposition同implicature (會涉及少量logic, 但無logic底都唔洗驚, 做下exercises就會明), 同埋cooperative principle (Grice's Maxims)<br /><br />中間有2個interim topics (Modules 5-6), 一個分析廣告同笑話既language use (assignment就係做類似既野), 另一個比較human language同animal language/machine language既特點<br /><br />下半部分 (Modules 7-10) 屬於語用學(Pragmatics), 主要講speech acts, 即係用說話黎做事, 例如promising, apologizing, 研究唔同speech acts有咩felicity conditions, 例如點解 &quot;I'll give you an A+&quot; 係有效既promise, 但 &quot;I'll give you an F&quot; 只可以係threat而唔可以作為一種promise, 又例如點解 &quot;I'll be back&quot; 唔可以作為一種apology, 最後會講politeness principles (Leech's Politeness Principles)<br /><br />總括黎講, 成個course內容幾有趣同生活化, 同埋都會學到唔少文化知識, 例如西方人去完人地屋企開party之後會多謝主人家既款待, 但日本人會道歉 (&quot;打攪晒&quot;), 又例如唔同國家既人受人讚賞既時候會有唔同既回應, 包括: thanking (&quot;多謝&quot;), questioning (&quot;係咩?&quot;), denial (&quot;邊度係呀&quot;), etc.<br /><br />P.S. 如果你讀HUMA3030之前讀過HUMA2010 (好似我咁), 有部分內容你應該學過 (entailment, metaphor, metonymy), 會輕鬆少少",

It is important to note that sometimes she will mention things which are not included or stated in the ppts but they will be also tested in the quizzes. Hence, it is quite important to attend the lectures if you want to get an &quot;A&quot;.

Both of the quizzes have two parts: 25 MC questions and a few short questions, 50% for each part.<br />(2) Research paper: It can be an individual work or in a group of 3 at most. With reference to grading, consideration will be taken into account regarding whether the project is done by an individual or by a group. She actually didn't state how many pages or words are required for the research paper. However, I did ask her about that. She said for a group of two, she expects at least 3000 words. Moreover, she emphasizes on &quot;Creativity&quot; which means nobody/no scholars has done your paper topic will be the best. I think she also prefers quantitative research than qualitative. For more details, please kindly refer to the attached paper instruction. <br />(3) Presentation: 8mins for presentation + 2mins for Q&amp;A session. If you use more than 8 minutes for presentation, she won't stop you but you will have lesser time for Q&amp;A part which may probably affect your Q&amp;A score.<br /><br />Overall, I think the workload is fair but she maybe a bit demanding for the research paper as you may know if you decide to enroll this course.",

A technical approach is adopted, thus in contrast to the usual humanities course, where there are no correct answers, you are often expected to rationalize and provide a concrete response in huma3030. For those who have a mathematical/science mindset, this course is perhaps more suitable than other, essay-based humanities courses.",

Personally, I achieved a really good final grade in spite of a mediocre first quiz score. I am however unclear as to the overall distribution - my guess would be okay-to-good.",

I think the material is not particularly hard, but the bottom line is that you need to thoroughly understand each concept, or else you will find it difficult answering longer questions in quizzes/exams. <br /><br />I opted out one of the midterms/quizzes for a written assignment and spent around 10 hours completing it - it requires you to sit down and think carefully.<br /><br />There will also be a lot of reading material (not compulsory). I did not complete all of it, but I can say that it will really help you",
