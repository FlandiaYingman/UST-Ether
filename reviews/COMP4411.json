The core project parts are fairly easy and there are many resources online.<br /><br />There are 4 projects though. They are all in C++. This means you will spend a lot of time during your semester writing code, debugging, testing... The project can be done in groups of 2 or individually.

            "comment_content": "Rich and detailed.<br /><br />Most of necessary technique and maths are covered, including:<br />Image processing, display and color, 2D/3D Transformation, Hierarchical Modelling, Hidden Surface Algorithm, Ray Tracing, Ray Intersection, Shading, Texture Mapping, Parametric Curves, Particle System, Surface, Animation<br /><br />You will learn a lot of concept, proof, and calculation in this course. In the meantime, the assignments push you to practice and implement them by coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really a meaningful course in terms of content if you wish to learn more about CG.",
            "comment_teaching": "Pretty poor as stated in title.<br /><br />CK Tang tries to be a good instructor by making many jokes and mentioning interesting things. However, due to his ‘lagging’ way of speaking and rapid content switch, he is unable to express a fluent flow of lecture content. Students often feel confused with where he is explaining and how that is related to the topics before.<br />In most instances, we figure out what is happening by our actual implementation in assignment and revision.",
            "comment_grading": "A normal distribution, can be further raised by bonus.<br /><br />48% Projects<br />49% Final Exam<br />3% Paper Homework<br /><br />Frankly speaking, if you expect an easy exam with light workload like those good-grade CC, you are strongly discouraged to enroll this course.<br /><br />The exam is hard, there are many bonus task (aka Bells &amp; Whistles, B/W) in projects which makes them tedious.<br />On the other hand, if you really make effort on the assignments to gain the bonus (basically impossible to finish all bonus since some of them are too difficult and troublesome), you earn a rise in subgrade.<br /><br />My subjective view on B/W:<br />I need to spend around 1-2 hrs per Bell if I do it 100% on my own.<br />In my semester (relatively higher standard since students get at most 90B/W in the past):<br />~140 B/W (All completed): 3 subgrades up<br />~80 B/W: 2 subgrades up<br />~40 B/W: 1 subgrade up",
            "comment_workload": "Depends. Can be an A or an E.<br /><br />A: If you do neither wish to do bonus nor the 3% paper homework.<br />E: If you do as many B/W as you can, finish all paper homework, study all past papers.",

Btw make sure you know how the code works as you are required to explain some code during the lab. <br /><br />The assignments are graded by whether have you submitted, so just do a few questions and just submit it can still get full credits<br /><br />I am really happy about doing all the bells and whistles so if you love coding you will have a happy time like me",
