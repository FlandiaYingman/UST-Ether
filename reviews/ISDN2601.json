        "description": "This course provides an introductory experience into the design and application of smart mechatronic systems on building integrative systems. Students will learn how smart integrative systems are built to sense and interact with humans and the environment, to serve everyday real-world needs. The course includes fundamental theory and also practical hands-on labs and projects for the student to acquire the basic knowledge of designing mechatronic systems, using embedded system to control and practice design thinking process. In the lab sessions, students design and build a succession of mechatronic subsystems, leading to an integrated system in a final project. Lecture topics include embedded system design, basic electronics, use of sensors and actuators, system modelling, measurement and control, and appreciation of the impact of smart mechatronics system in solving real-world problems. In the final project, students will apply design thinking approach to meet the project requirements, specified from usersâ€™ perspective.",
