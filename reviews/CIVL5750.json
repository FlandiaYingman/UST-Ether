Professor gives a lot of hints for the homework, even including the slide numbers where we can get the answer from.<br /><br />The final exam was also long, but good thing that the exam was kind of similar to the homework, so even though it was long, it was also just okay. <br /><br />If I remember correctly, he also asked the class if we wanted either a project or an exam.",
