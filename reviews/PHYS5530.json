            "comment_content": "This course follows Sean Caroll's 'Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity' textbook.<br /><br />This semester, we covered the first 7 chapters:<br /><br />1) Special relativity and Flat Spacetime<br />2) Manifolds<br />3) Curvature<br />4) Gravitation<br />5) Schawrzchild Solution<br />6) More General Balck Holes<br />7) Perturbation Theory and Gravitational Radiation<br /><br />Overall, it's a standard coverage to an introductory GR course but I personally would've preferred an extended focus on the preparatory materials in the first few chapters since they're so instrumental (but also hard to pick up immediaterly)",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. LIU is a passionate lecturer. He's energetic and actively promotes student participation. (He'll point to you and ask you questions directly lol). He's also open to questions in class and gives us stories every once in a while to keep it interesting.",
            "comment_grading": "I audited the course so I cannot comment on the letter grades. <br /><br />HWs were worth 75% of the grade, with the remaining 25% assigned to a take-home final exam (2 weeks). Since there were 5 homeworks in total, each HW assignment was worth 15% of the grade.<br /><br />HW scores: (out of 100)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My score | Mean<br />HW1: 96 | 95.3<br />HW2: 93 | 91.61<br />HW3: 86 | 90.83<br />HW4: 94 | 84.23<br />HW5:&nbsp;&nbsp;Nil<br /><br />(Because of a certain personal situation that I'll refrain from disclosing, I couldn't do HW5. As such, I did not have access to the score distribution on canvas)<br /><br />The final exam mean was 78.26/100.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 5 problems&nbsp;&nbsp;(all from the textbook). Owing to the aforementioned situation, I could only manage to attempt two problems. My score was 35/100.<br /><br />Despite all of that, since the HWs were worth so much of the grade, I could comfortably pass the course. Based on the class performance, I think getting an A range is not an impossible task. But it'll certainly take a lot of work.",
            "comment_workload": "As a UG student taking this, the workload absolutely killed me. I'm still giving it a C instead of an E since this is to be expected from a PG-level course. We had 5 homework in total. Each one consisted of a number of textbook questions (a few were made by the Prof himself). Each question can easily take up to a few hours for you to solve if you solve it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no solution manuals available online like UG courses so you're (mostly) on your own, although you might get some hints/solutions online for some 'popular' questions.<br /><br />Besides the homework, it is important to be up-to-date with the textbook. You should read it by yourself after the class (Reading it once may not be enough and you may not understand most of the stuff at first). This is really the main workload of the course. It takes enormous time and effort to really 'finish' a chapter properly. Without knowledge of the prior chapters, it'll be hard to keep up with future lectures.",
