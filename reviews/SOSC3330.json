        "description": "This course takes a critical and comparative review of the most significant dictatorships in the 20th century, the Third Reich under Hitler, the Soviet Russian system under Stalin, and the Chinese Party-state under Mao. All the three systems stem from ideologically powerful mass revolutionary movements and produced distinctive political, social and economic results. Many of their legacies are still felt even today and, therefore, studying them from a distance will lead to valuable lessons.",
