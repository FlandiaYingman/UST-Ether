Energy Analysis for Closed Systems<br />5. Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes<br />6. Second Law of Thermodynamics<br />7. Entropy<br /><br />Previous experience in PHYS1112 (which covers the First and Second Law on Thermodynamics except entropy) helps with understanding this course's content. While one may be confused by the concepts of the course initially, practice make perfect, especially due to the fact that the course's question is rather the same. I recommend you buy the course's textbook or get some questions from your friend or the library.<br /><br />That said, everything will be mixed up towards the end of the course (In Professor Fu's word, he could &quot;design one question about entropy which covers everything from the beginning to the end&quot;). If you can't catch up, you screw up. As commented by others, concepts about control volume in this course will be useful in MECH2210, so confusion in this course will lead to confusion later.<br /><br />P.S. As a number of questions require reading steam tables and other tables, you are recommended to bring 2 rulers with you to locate the intended range on tables and avoid confusing numbers of other rows and columns.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Fu is new to HKUST. Perhaps due to a relative lack in teaching experience, I'll say that Professor Fu's teaching is too cramped. Examples on Chapter 3 and 4 (which is one of the foundations for later chapters) were flew through quickly. We only have some 5 minutes to think on each question before Professor Fu explained and revealed the answer.<br /><br />Consequential to his fast pace, we were left with 1 free week (compared to extra lectures needed in the other lecture session) to revise everything before the final exam, though I think a more balanced teaching timetable is better for us.<br /><br />Another minor criticism is that he assumed that most of the students know tabular interpolation, which caused confusion when we get data that don't correspond to steam table until it is explained in tutorials. While tabular interpolation itself only involve DSE Math skills, I believe it would be noteworthy to have a bit of explanation on these specified skills, especially the answers in teaching PowerPoint and textbook don't explain much on tabular interpolation.<br /><br />While I generally don't link accent with teaching quality, his English speaking can be confusing due to heavy Chinese accent: pronouncing &quot;work&quot; as &quot;wok&quot; or &quot;enthalpy&quot; as &quot;en-SAL-py&quot; are some of the most common mispronunciations in his class. That said, I eventually adapted to his accent once I confirmed the actual meanings of his mispronounced words.<br />[N.B.: And... it seems that th-s-sh pronunciation confusion is quite common among Chinglish speakers?]<br /><br />Speaking of our TAs, their tutorials mostly cover extra questions (usually 1 to 2 per tutorial), similar to MATH tutorials. As a result, I can only comment their teaching quality as &quot;mediocre&quot;.",

Some questions are designed to require cheats like WolframAlpha (or trial and error) to solve, so don't be shocked if you ended up with a mess that can't be solved by your calculator - after all they allow 5% error in answers.<br /><br />In terms of the the midterm and final exams, both of their questions are noticeably easier than the homework questions. Our final exam even have a question that required us to prove the relation between the Kelvin-Planck statement and Clausius Statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which would be easy for those who understand the course content well.<br /><br />Ultimately get an A+ for the course. Judging from other's information, it seems that the course's grade is quite good: one of my friend also get A+, while another who reported himself screwing the final gets a B-range grade.",
            "comment_workload": "A total of 7 assignments were released, each corresponded to one chapter. Among them, only 6 of them count towards the final homework grade.<br /><br />On average, I spent 3 to 4 days for dealing with each assignments. Referring to extra problems in the textbook was sometimes needed. Of course, if you have a better understanding, you should spend less time to deal with assignments. Apart from that, most of the workload for me was related to extra questions in textbooks and revision for the midterm and final.",

But overall, the mid-term exam is not difficult.

And unlike other subject like phys1112 which provide all the equations in it's mid-term, this one only provides the NECESSARY equations so you don't need to choose which equation you have to use for answering. Of course, they are not in sequence with the questions but if you study carefully, you can distinguish them easily. <br />Hw: 15%<br />midterm: 35%<br />Final: 50%<br />However, this year social unrest is quite serious in HK so the professor cancels the final and the weighing will be different.",
