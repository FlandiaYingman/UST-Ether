First, you can figure out who is the free-rider of your group and you can report to the professor right at the start of the project. Second, you don't need to rush for your final report while you are handing in other reports for other subjects at the same time. Third, you will receive suggestions from your professor for every part of your report. It is more easy for you to clarify the concepts and finalize the final report.",
