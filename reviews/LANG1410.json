            "comment_content": "ILO:<br />1. translate simple statements and questions from Latin to English and vice versa.<br />2. understand how Latin has influenced modern English word formation.<br />3. understand the etymology of a number of English words derived from Latin.<br />4. recognise some allusions to ancient Roman culture which are reflected in modern English vocabulary and expressions.<br />5. appreciate the legacy of Latin and the Roman world.<br /><br />There are 2 topics in this course, the Latin language and the Roman world. The language part is easy to pick up, it is taught just like most beginner level third language courses, which starts with simple daily sentences and vocabulary. Latin is a mysterious and complicated language with lots of ties with English and Romance languages, you will learn to appreciate and be intrigued by it, but come to accept that you can never truly learn all of Latin. Mastery is not required anyway, you will only be tested on simple phrases and the most basic grammar.<br /><br />The other part of the course is the Roman World. Aspects of Roman life were introduced by playing documentary films on archaeological finds and Roman writings. The interesting and enlightening discussions afterwards would be very enjoyable if classics and history interests you.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Huckstep is very humble and gentlemanly teacher. His style of lesson is relaxing and very conducive to discussions, which makes his class thought-provoking and enjoyable. He does his best to address every students' questions, he would not simply dismiss students ideas, instead they often end in intellectual discussions.",
            "comment_grading": "Mid-term exam 20%<br />Research presentation 40%<br />End-of-term exam 40%<br /><br />Tests on the Latin language are not hard. For the presentation, we picked an aspect of Roman society and discussed the historical facts. I got swarmed by ideas as the Romans had lots of impressive and weird things going on. You would get decent marks if your presentation is meaningful and interesting, preferably fun for the class.",
            "comment_workload": "You are not expected to master the Latin language. If you put a bit of an effort to revise the kindergarten-level words and grammar after each class, you would be able to handle the exams. As this is a CLE language course, the 80% attendance rule applies, you need to attend the lessons to learn any language anyway.<br /><br />The research presentation is not a serious academic discussion, you do not need hours of in-depth research. It should be easy for any university student with access to the internet.",
