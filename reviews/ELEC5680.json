        "description": "This course focuses on advanced deep learning architectures and their applications in various areas. Specifically, the topics include various deep neural network architectures with applications in computer vision, signal processing, graph analysis, and natural language processing. Different state-of-the-art neural network models will be introduced, including graph neural networks, normalizing flows, point cloud models, sparse convolutions,and neural architecture search. The students have the opportunities to implement deep learning models for some AI-related tasks such as visual perception, image processing and generation, graph processing, speech enhancement, sentiment classification, and novel view synthesis.",
