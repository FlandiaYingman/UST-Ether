        "description": "This course introduces students to the theories and physical practices of stage movement and the development of non-verbal communication skills. Through a multitude of exercises, students will learn to explore movement and their own body in a group context, and realize how movement is generated from emotion and reflects emotion. Students will also learn how to relate movement with space, use their imagination to explore movement, and the techniques to utilize the body for effective communication. The course also focuses on continuous training on flexibility, coordination and physical strength, so that the body is physically and mentally fit for sustaining performances.",
