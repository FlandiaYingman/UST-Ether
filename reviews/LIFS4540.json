Since I have barely any previous knowledge on structural biology, I enjoyed getting an overview of many topics. But this will depend on whether you prefer broad or more focused content.<br /><br />Prof. Dang also did a quiz in the beginning (not graded) to assess our previous knowledge. When explaining certain topics he would focus on things he knew many people got wrong in the quiz.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Dang is known for having a strong accent and it definitely is hard to understand him sometimes. However, he is willing to go over a topic multiple times when needed, and he also is very responsive to emails. He answers any questions you have in depth, so don't be afraid to reach out.",
            "comment_grading": "Prof. Dang did a survey in the beginning on how we want to be assessed. There were two options for grading:<br /><br />Option 1:<br />Midterm exam: 30%<br />Final exam: 30%<br />Presentation: 40%<br /><br />Option 2:<br />Midterm exam: 30%<br />Final exam: 30%<br />Assignments: 40%<br /><br />For option 2, you choose 2 out of 5 assignments. If you do more than 2, your best scores would be counted. Assignments include seminar reports, literature review and other tasks.<br /><br />The exams are pretty easy even if you do not know all of the content. Question formats are True/False, MCQ and short answer questions. They also include questions for bonus marks.<br /><br />My scores:<br />Midterm: 92/100 (Mean: 87)<br />Final: Not released<br />Assignment 1: 18/20 (Mean: 17.4)<br />Seminar report 2: 19/20 (Mean: ~17 I think)<br />Overall grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is extremely light. Don't bother studying everything for the exams, you will be fine even with surface level knowledge, but make sure to know your amino acids well.<br /><br />Since you can choose which assignment you do, just do them when you have less work in other courses. I finished both my assignments within less than two days. You have two weeks to finish them, and can even request an extension.<br /><br />I took this course in second year and this was my best course grade that sem. If you have even just a bit more knowledge than me before taking this course, you can probably get away with doing even less work than me.",

The scope is often too broad, and not enough detail is covered for certain techniques or reactions. Most of the time, some equations or abstract concepts are introduced and are either not elaborated enough, or can't be elaborated enough due to the lack of knowledge in physics and mathematics.

Fewer but lengthier topics",
