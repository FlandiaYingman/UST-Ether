            "comment_content": "Three tutorial sessions (attendance is not not mandatory) in the first three weeks combined with the actual lab sessions that also begin in the first week of the semester:<br /><br />Tutorial sessions (Professor Wang):<br />1. Course Syllabus<br />2. Scientific Graphing &amp; Data analysis<br />3. Guideline for Lab Report+Summary<br /><br />Lab sessions (TAs and IA):<br />1.Direct Measurement of the Speed of Light (two weeks)<br />2.Blackbody Radiation (two weeks)<br />3.Electrical Conduction in Solids (one week)<br />4.Photoelectric Effect (one week)<br />5.Charge-to-Mass Ratio of the Electron (one week)<br />6.Electron Diffraction (one week)<br />7.The Balmer Series of Hydrogen (one week)<br />8.Radioactive Decay and Radiation Absorption (one week)<br /><br />Some of the pre-lab questions are poorly designed and are not related to the contents of the lab.",
            "comment_teaching": "Students only get to see the TA and a technical assistant during the lab. There is essentially no teaching as the course was designed for students to explore and get a conceptual feel of the principles in modern physics by themselves. In the beginning of each lab, the TA will spend about 5 minutes to note some points to consider. However, most of the time his English will be incomprehensible (I could barely understand a thing from the TA in our section throughout the semester. Most other students also could not understand his English). He sometimes even speaks in Mandarin if he does not know the English words. It is therefore suggested to ask the IA for help if the assigned TA is not a fluent English speaker.<br /><br />Professor Wang actively responds to questions during the tutorials, so it will be good to attend the tutorial sessions if the students have not previously taken/audited PHYS1113/PHYS1115.",
            "comment_grading": "Final grade is based on the lab performance (20%) + lab reports (60%) + summary (20%). <br /><br />The grading scale is lenient but unclear. Different TAs will grade the reports and summary with their own standards. As for how the lab performance is graded, I directly quote what I have been told by the TA AFTER the semester by email: <br /><br />&quot;The lab performance consist of 4 parts: Lab preparation&amp; time arrangement, Team work&amp;safety, Quality of work and Understanding of materials&amp; problem solving. For the first two part, the average student will get full points. For the last two point, they will get 1.5 point for each one. For each session, only one or two group will be graded. More than 8/10 point because I have to make sure that their performance is really better than others. For those group, I usually ask them to write down their name .If I miss you even you write down your name.&quot;<br /><br />The class was never told about this or writing down our names whatsoever (or maybe he did tell us, either in Mandarin or in his baffling English). Most labs in PHYS2023 are conducted in a dark room, and students have to draw the curtains and play around with the light inside. The TA was always outside the curtains and has never come to check my lab. Hence, my lab performance grade was consistently 8/10. In terms of this, I cannot tell how fair the performance grading was.<br /><br />For reference, my final grade is:<br />Performance: 80%<br />Report: 93.9%<br />Summary: 94.5%<br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />More details of the grading benchmarks for the lab report and performance are included as attachments below.",
            "comment_workload": "Slightly rigorous workload. One lab report, pre-lab report coupled with a summary of the lab (min 300 words, max 450 words) are to be submitted at the beginning of lab session every week. <br /><br />Some of the pre-lab questions are irrelevant to the contents of the actual lab (that happened to be the blackbody radiation and charge-to-mass ratio, if I recall correctly. Some required knowledge in astrophysics/solid state physics to answer fully). In these cases, students have to depend on external or online references to search for answers as the materials are also not taught in the correspondent course, PHYS2022.",
