Students will study and reflect on fashion with a historical perspective through introducing important fashion trends, icons, designers and material development. The course will also open students’ mind to the discussion of how fashion interacts with social changes, as reflected in the development of the hippies’ style, the social status of women, globalization and the growth of fashion enterprises. As an integral part of the course, students will learn sewing techniques and utilize sewing equipment, which can be applied in the creation of a finished garment by themselves. Students learn to appreciate the practical, historical and artistic integration of fashion design.",

            "comment_content": "the course covered around 160 years of fashion industry in 1 month, and it was expected that it was not going to be something in great detail, however, personally speaking, I think it is good enough for non-fashion background students to study the characteristic of each era and famous designers. Also, the course provided chances to practice sewing techniques .",
            "comment_teaching": "The lecture were mainly divided in to 2 parts, 40-45 mins theory session, and remaining 1.5 hours is for practical skill learning of how to sew. There was a TA and she gave me good and practical advice on techniques.",

            "comment_workload": "Since the instructor did not expect every student to have a sewing machine at home, he did not required the class work to be a finished product. I think for student don't have sewing machine, the class work is just a in-class exercise, you do not need to spend extra time.<br />For the design product, the workload depends on your design. If you want to make it perfect, you will need to spend more time.",

            "comment_content": "Lectures are on Fashion History. Reading the textbook, which is available at the library provides just a little more detail than delivered in class. The lectures are not difficult or boring at all. There are only few points to remember for each era, such as silhouette, fabric choice, patterns, which comes easy if you're interested in vintage fashion and the current trend. However, I did came in the course expecting a bit more tailoring skills to be taught. We were taught to make simple projects like a skirt or a dress, but we were only taught techniques and not how to design and produce from scratch. I was quite disappointed there wasn't more time for learning how to draw a pattern, properties of different fabrics, or color theory.",
