Projects with low environmental impact and/or low carbon footprint will also be discussed.",

            "comment_content": "Disclaimer: My opinion may not reflect everyone's opinion that took this course. <br /><br />The content is super relevant to energy sector related careers. During an interview at CLP, I have used so much knowledge learnt from this course including GHG emission guidelines, Emission source and types, pollution control and risk assessment.<br /><br />This course is surprisingly easy for me. The contents are quite logical and easy to process. One reason might be that many video references are from Discovery channel and National Geographic channel, which I often watch at leisure time. The content is vast covering energy resources, environmental impact decision making Life cycle analysis and calculation of environmental impact. <br /><br />This requires basic calculation (no matrix) and a highly logical and critical thinking skills. During the exam, the time is more than enough to complete the papers. The was set to be 3 hours but I completed it in 70 mins (with triple checking). More details on exam at grading part.",
            "comment_teaching": "Despite the great content and lenient grading, the teaching is not too interesting. Firstly, the class begins 9am at LSK business building. Secondly, he starts sharply at 9am and talks straight for 1.5 hours. <br />One thing that keeps us from skipping class and sleeping is that he will randomly choose students to answer questions. Being active will add bonus score to your final grade",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is pretty lenient overall. Your grade is more than likely to be based on your mid terms and exams as most people will get similar score for homework and project.<br /><br />Both mid term and exam are written, open notes exam. The prof. is go through the exam papers once at the start of exam and hint a LOT for us. Prof. explained that he wants us to show logical thinking in the papers rather than reciting knowledge from lecture notes (this is why he go through the questions and allow open notes)<br />You can't find the answer directly from notes. Rather you have to process the information from the exam paper and make decisions based on the knowledge you accumulate throughout the course.<br /><br />More details on homework and project at workload part.<br />I think I nailed both exams and done a pretty good job on homework and projects. Prof does not disclose the score other than the mid term score. I scored a 94/100 in midterm whereas the mean is 77/100. My final grade is A. Fabulous!",
            "comment_workload": "One funny incident happened during this semester. The professor originally assign 4 homework throughout the course. However, the first homework (calculating HK carbon emission footprint) was so butthurt enough that he cancelled off all remaining homework since our feedback was really strong! That left us much more comfortable throughout the rest of the term.<br /><br />There is also a simple project assigned to us after Easter. You are asked to designed a new commercially viable product and present it to class with a 5 pages technical proposal and marketing strategy (Very easy!) That took my group 3 relaxing weeks to complete, with a final presentation day during the study week in May.<br /><br />Last but not least the mid term and exams. Since I think the content is not difficult at all, I didn't study too much on it. Rather, I scan through the notes and search for important keywords to be referenced during the open notes exam. Many students print huge amount of notes to the exam, but ended using less than 1%. Therefore, it is important for you to know which part of content you might need notes and which you can skip to avoid excessive reading during exam.",

Just little guidelines and steps for energy balance.<br />No need to borrow BOOKS form the library.<br />It's USELESS.<br />Must have your own notes. Just take notes during lectures and understand the example provided (if you do not understand you should still copy it down and ask after class).<br />The Prof. will read through the questions with you before the exam start. Even if you don't understand what the questions mean, you can ask for clarification and simple explanation during exams.<br />The exam is not difficult if you study and go to lecture. But I do see people got A even they don't go to lecture. (Prof. did tell us that we didn't need to attend every lecture if we want to study on our own. The reading materials and powerpoint on the canvas are enough for self-study)<br />But go to lecture sometimes give you the hint for exams. (Just pay attention which part the Prof. spend time on)",

I'd say your exam grades are just based on luck :)<br /><br />Assignments: not related to what is taught in class either! We were given some pdf files (&gt;100 pages) and asked to answer some random questions. I don't understand the point of doing the assignments. I just did it somehow and submitted it, and I don't know! cuz they don't release grades nor give feedback.<br /><br />Case study: I don't want to say this is a case study because it is not :P No clear instructions, no purpose, and no learning.<br /><br />The workload is not high, but what makes me angry is that everything I've done for this class was a meaningless labor.<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel so pity for future EVMT students who will take this course.",
