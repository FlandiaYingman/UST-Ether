I would say the content is comparatively easy for a 4000-level elective course and CIVL students with prior knowledge would find the EIA content &amp; calculations are much easier than those covered in CIVL 2410. <br /><br />I would say the content covered both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in assessing various types of environmental impacts of a proposed project during the design, construction &amp; operation stages. However, the content are somehow outdated or simplified compared to today's industrial practice. <br />(Prof managed to reuse the notes for decades) <br /><br />Outline:<br />1. EIA &amp; national/regional environmental policy act in HK/China/US<br />2. Planning &amp; management of EIA <br />3. Methods for impact identifications, description of environmental setting<br />4.

But still the delivery is very clear and he encourages students to type questions in the chat box. He will reply all those questions after class through mass email. <br /><br />You will also find Xiang-ru has no sense of humor. In the middle of the class, he will suddenly play a random, unrelated video to serve as an attention seeker, but he fails to do so by looking all the boring faces from students. Yes, you are one-hundred percent boring.",

The exam lasts for 1.5 hours&nbsp;&nbsp;with 10 conceptual questions and 3 calculation questions which are very similar to assignment problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My grade:<br />Attendance: full<br />Assignment: full <br />Final: unknown (I think I managed to get &gt;80% of the total score even I don't know how to find minimum DO and made a careless mistake...) <br /><br />Turns out A+.<br /><br />So I really recommend you to join this class as an elective.",

So I really recommend you to take this if you just look up for a nice grade. <br /><br />4 assignments where you will find yourself relax if you have sources from your seniors. Even you don't have, the calculation questions are easy by simply following the lecture notes. Every single assignment would just spend you less than an hour to complete. They provide an entire week for you to do so, so it is very manageable. <br /><br />However, students should come to real-time lecture not only because attendance counts, you need to make extra remarks on the lecture notes in every single class, the professor includes more annotations and explanations on specific terminologies, you better write all down since those remarks are examined too. <br /><br />You should note that this year the professor didn't provide any lecture videos due to copyrights issue. You better attend the real-time lecture or else you are fucked. <br /><br />If you have a senior who shared his previous notes to you, you will find all the annotations are way the same :)",
