            "comment_content": "As the course name says, this course is about indoor air quality (IAQ). The content is listed as below:<br /><br />1. Review (basic math, e.g. how to solve a separable ODE, continuously stirred model, mass vs number concentration)<br />2. Overall overview (basic intro to different aspects in IAQ)<br />3. Ventilation<br />4. CO2, Radon<br />5. Indoor Aerosol and filtration<br />6. VOCs<br />7. Bioaerosol<br />8. Asbestos<br />9. Thermal comfort<br /><br />The content is rich, but it seems that the prof don't have time to finish them. He expects us to read the lecture notes by ourselves, but there are too many words in those PPT files. After introduction to different kinds of pollutants, assessment methods and calculations will be mentioned.<br /><br />This is a useful course if you would like to work in Building Services Industry or to be a Energy Auditor.",
            "comment_teaching": "LAW, Anthony is a visiting lecturer as the previous professor in charge of this course has moved away. He has teaching experience in PolyU and has a company outside. He always talks about stuff not (directly) related to this course, and it is difficult to differentiate between this and the course materials. This is not totally his fault as I have a 9am class on the morning and this course is from 6 pm to 9 pm! I am extremely tired in the evening and I cannot concentrate. A lot of things he mentioned in class will be tested in the exams, but I am not concentrated enough and cannot jot all the notes.<br /><br />As he is a visiting lecturer, it's a bit difficult to contact him by email, especially when we have questions regarding the project.",
            "comment_grading": "The bad logistic is the most confusing part of this course. Originally there are assignments, but suddenly they disappear. Besides, the deadlines for the project report and presentation are not clearly mentioned. <br /><br />Grading Scheme:<br />Pop-up Quiz (close-book) 5%<br />Homework 10% (but there is no homework, I dunno how this will be treated) <br />Project 30%<br />Midterm (open-book) 15%<br />Final (close-book) 40%<br /><br />The close-book exams are like a nightmare as I am not good at cramming those factual stuff. As our project is like a piece of s**t, I don't expect the grade to be that good. But eventually I got A-. I dunno why. The good grade is the only thing I appreciate Anthony.<br /><br />Some statistics:<br />Pop-up Quiz: 13/20 (mean: 12, sd: unknown)<br />Midterm: 47/65 (mean: 43.9, sd: unknown)<br />Others: unknown",
            "comment_workload": "For me, a lot of time is used to read those materials. Most of them are uploaded to Canvas immediately before the class, so a lot of things jump out of a sudden during the lectures. The project also costs a lot of time as there are so many bugs in our data. Cramming stuff before the close-book exams is another large workload.",

The lecture notes is very useful. Exam and midterm is not hard as expected. The project is more simple than it looks, it is a happy experience to learn the materials, test the machine and search info online for indoor air quality topic.",
