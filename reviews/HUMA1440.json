            "comment_teaching": "唔掂!!!! 我上維基仲好過上佢堂。佢好似expect啲人事前已經對中國歷史有認識，或者係覺得每次你都睇晒佢嘅reading material ，每次上堂主要係講每個事件裡面嘅一小部份，仲要係佢嘅睇法，最多係白板寫幾個字，對考試冇乜幫助，所以如果你熟歷史，你會明佢講咩，唔熟就完全唔知佢講咩。我諗應該好多人都係咁諗，每次上堂都得番好少人，我諗有20幾個XD<br /><br />同埋佢係冇lecture note/ppt，只有佢所謂嘅notes，但應該佢/極度專心好學嘅人先明，份notes通常冇完整句子，好多係point form，好多係xxxx+xxxxx+xxxx=xxxx,又或者係幾個詞語後面再加個問號=.=想點??<br /><br />p.s. 上堂唔take attendance，只係tutorial先計",

            "comment_teaching": "Though some comment said it is hard to follow the tutor, I had no problem at all. Mr Ho’s tone is clear, and he would summarise the main ideas in last lesson, or picked a student to do so when every lessons started. <br /><br />He is more like a critic of Chinese history, he highlighted his objective of giving you a different view which official textbooks won’t tell. For example, he thought Britain wasn’t that responsible for the Opium War solely, Lin Zexu and Sun Yixian weren’t that intelligent and moral, Manzu’s reforms weren’t that Bad etc.<br /><br />Most importantly, a lot of content he mentioned will be useful for the exam (For mine, 3 out of 5 exam questions allowed you to copy directly of what he had said). Therefore it is easy to guess the questions by summarising the notes (Eg Why Lin Zexu was more responsible for the Opium War, Why Treaty ports brought benefits and less harms to China, Why China’s sovereignty wasn’t been infringed seriously...)<br /><br />Majority of textbook content hold an opposite view with Mr Ho, so the examples and statistics in it maybe useful, but not for the arguments. Overall he is a professor with passion, care and definite view.",

I wrote around 3000 words in english for each question, and got an A. He gave a hint that you had to compare the options given when there are words like ‘more’ or ‘better’ in the question.",

Attendance is needed for tutorials but not compulsory for the lectures. You may skip all of them if you have strong faith on own ability. However, I strongly suggest attending all of them which make your exam much simpler (I really copied 70-80% words from my jotted notes directly with minor adjustments LOL)",

Some of the lectures were actually quite fun to discuss and talk about.",
            "comment_teaching": "Lawrence teaching was quite funny and he was very willing to meet students to talk about their assignments. Although students have claimed that they could not understand what he was talking on lessons, I think this was mainly because he like to add some of his judgement on historical events. he was really patient to answer students questions and concerns on the course. He also gave comments and give instructions to our assignments which I think it was quite helpful for Year 1 students. Meanwhile, he did not like students trapped by the exam-oriented mindset so better asked him for instructions clearly on the assignment. However, the main point is his PPT slides mostly comprised of pictures and photos which required students to jot down everything he said and mentioned.",

I have got the essay for 94/100 and 92/100. For exam question I got 50/50 and final was unreleased. I thought I did not do a great job in my final but turned out got an A+ as a final grade. I think he has a quite good grading.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload really depending on when did you start your assignments. The course had a lot of readings but no need to read all of them. Only read those Lawrence pointed out during the lecture would be fine. Lawrence had actually gave instructions on the assignment quite early. If you start it early and complete it bit by bit, I think it would not be a very big concern as a Year 1 student. Since the lecture did not count attendance at last, you may actually skipped all the lectures and just watched them before the final exam.",

            "comment_content": "The content of this class is very interesting. As a foreigner who has never studied Chinese history in depth, this class was fascinating for me - but I'm sure it was also fascinating to the Chinese students to re-learn their national history according to the professor's information/opinions.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor can be hard to follow sometimes - he will break off into Chinese to explain a concept and leave non-Chinese students confused. He has no powerpoints, slides, or supporting material other than a note-sheet he will hand out intermittently with tiny little fragments of his lectures on there - they're useless if you miss a class. Basically, if you miss a class and don't have a friend there taking notes for you, you're screwed. <br />However, it's clear that the professor really cares about the material, and he endeavors to answer every question thoroughly (although not necessarily concisely).",
            "comment_grading": "Grading was a bit of a mystery to me. The only grades we received were for 3 discussions, one midterm, and one final. We had received 0 grades for anything by the time we had written 2 of the discussions - this was upsetting as it gave us no way to know how well/poorly we had done, if we needed to improve or not. It was often not very clear what the professor wanted us to deliver - he would say we just needed to spend 20-30 minutes writing a quick response to the discussion questions, and then such answers received very low grades. This was confusing and frustrating at first, but once I figured this out, I did better.<br />My final grade in the class was a B+.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload was moderately heavy - lots of very dense readings, memorizing, and more more moreeee reading. <br />However, if you're an idiot (like me) you can put off the readings until right before the exam, cram everything into a final few days of frantic reading and studying, and it's not totally impossible that you'll do well :) -- but don't do this. Actually go to lecture! It's interesting and worthwhile. Read the readings when they are assigned so you don't get screwed during exams. Then you will be totally fine.",

Unlike history teachers in high school who focus on memorizing historical events, he tends to teach us by giving statistics and some stories.

But all the questions are related to the lecture, so as long as you listen to lecture carefully, there's not much trouble.<br />For my personal case, I received B+ for participation and A for the essay, and my final grade is A-.",

The required reading is Immanuel Hsu's 'The Rise of Modern China'. But we don't have to read the whole book for the professor hardly covered half of the events in the book. The optional reading is much heavier, usually one book per topic, but since it's only optional it's up to you to decide if or not to read it. <br />As for the essay, the workload is really flexible as there's no word limit. People usually write around 3000 words. But there's always diligent students who would write more than 20000 words (in Chinese, though).",

Maybe I was above mean in the finals.<br /><br />By the way, as the professor does not have a TA, the participation marks were not counted this time. Not sure if it will be counted in the following terms.",

However, if you are not interested or haven't learnt Chinese history before, I recommend you to take other courses instead. Also, if you are non-Chinese background student, you will easily get confused with all historical issues and other historical elements.",

He sometimes speaks Cantonese in lecture that confuses non-canto speaking students, considering that it's common core course. He does not provide any PPT or notes that you might need to jot down or make voice records for all classes as you will miss out some important points that will appear on exam paper. I would say TAs were very helpful, and they were always willing to help students.",
            "comment_grading": "The professor's grading scheme isn't strict nor very relaxed. However if you put effort and write as much as you can (especially for essay) he will be very considerate and give you high marks.<br />However, the professor still haven't released the grade even till now . After taking exam for 3 hours handwriting 4 short essays and 2 long essays for finals, he has never released the grade even till the next semester is about to start, so that you need to wait without knowing when.",

Each tutorial requires few chapters of reading, and it's impossible to read them just in one day.

Class performance is also part of your grade, and both TAs care about it very much.",
