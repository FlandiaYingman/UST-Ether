            "comment_content": "The content of ACCT3210 should be &quot;Advanced Managerial Accounting&quot;, however, about half of them are the same as ACCT2200&nbsp;&nbsp;Principles of Accounting II.<br />In the first lecture, Morris said he wanted to teach differently. He talked about the costing of selling coffee, and even making coffee in front of the class. He even said &quot;I am an economist which is going to teach accounting. We can easily replace accounting professors...&quot; That gave me great hope at first.<br /><br />But turns out he was trash in teaching, in a different way. <br />He said that last year when he was teaching ACCT2200, many students wrote badly in SFQ and commented that he was only reading PowerPoint slides. Thus this year he just used Excel files and Jupyter Notebook files to teach costing. That was a good try, but still fail to address the main issue: teaching skills.<br /><br />He failed to explain costing clearly. And with the extra contents of coding (many students do not have such skills and knowledge in Numpy, Matlpotlib, Scipy, sklearn, Pandas, statsmodels, Seaborn...), everyone just wants to die. Lucky for me, this semester I was also studying ACCT4720 Equity Investment with Machine learning, which give me plenty of experience to handle the coding contents in the lecture.<br /><br />Besides, the choice of the textbook is bad:<br />1. Many typos and mistakes in the textbooks and exercise.<br />2. Does not include a summary of equations in each chapter like many other textbooks do.",

Questions are somewhat easy to do but time costly.<br /><br />Final exam 50%<br />The full mark is 776, of which half of them are the same questions in the mid term exam. <br /><br />The final grading model is still a black box grading model, darker than the black hole. I fucked up many questions in the final exam, but still end up getting an A+, the best grade course in the UST!! <br />For your reference I got C+ in Financial Accounting and Company Law, thus I am skilful in management as I am a master of creative accounting! HAHAHA",
            "comment_workload": "To be honest, I paid little attention to this course.<br /><br />Group assignment 3 &quot;Cost Model Case Assignment&quot; cost me a lot of time and effort in coding. But the rest group assignment, they costed less than 1 hour.<br /><br />I only spent a few hours before the mid term exam, and 2 days before the final exam with many chapters skipped. Turns out the 4-hour long exam is barely enough for me to finish the exam, and I was the last one in the zoom to submit the exam.",

However, this does not change the fact that he is reading aloud the Python. For the second half, the concepts are more qualitative and hence he switched to read aloud slides.<br /><br />2. He tried to keep everyone attentive in Zoom by having 10% participation mark and requiring all people to turn on the camera. No lecture video published after class. However, he stopped requiring ppl turning on camera in March under COVID outbreak and allow ppl to watch lecture video afterwards. Still, it is a waste of time to watch the lecture video in 1.5 speed.<br /><br />3. He tried to apply daily examples when teaching and said that the textbook is outdated. However, given that the course are actually teaching common-sense concepts, his example does not really provide any insights on the topic.<br /><br />4. He hesitates quite a lot during the lecture.<br /><br />5. In the second half of course, he read aloud slides very quickly and finish all classes within 1 hour. However, it's even faster if you read the slides yourself.",

The question wordings are nearly identical. The Excel question is directly copied from midterm.

He also teaches some practical skills that we need as a managerial accountant. Some students think learning Excel or Python is not appropriate in this Accounting course, but personally I see no problem as Morris doesn't dig deep into it. <br />He is also a passionate and helpful teacher. After receiving feedback about the workload and assignments, Morris immediately changes the assignments into grade by submission. He also shortens the course syllabus after receiving feedback.

It is based on course concept and some analytics and should not be really that difficult although our group screwed up. The homework assignment is practice questions from textbook which you just have to submit for credit. Both midterm and final went online this semester, and the means were quite low... like 70/100 for midterm and 50/100 for final. Fortunately I did pretty well for the final and got an A.

Please Please Please recite the paragraph on textbook. Moreover, please also recite the content of balanced scorecard, since Tony will ask 1 question about this topic. I remember there is a question very similar to first in-class exercise. Please remember to capture all answers and formula during in-class exercise lessons~ I think rest of the questions are very similar to textbook exercises.<br /><br />For final exam, Tony allows us to bring a cheat sheet. Remember to put down the double-entry of handling joint cost. There is a question asking you to write double entry on joint cost. This part will only be taught in lecture. Please attend the class la!!! Final exam is much harder than in-class exercise and textbook exercise. Therefore, you better have more practice before exam.",
