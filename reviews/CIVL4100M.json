        "description": "This course provides a holistic understanding of the water cycle with a focus on the components that significantly affect the weather patterns on Earth. We address topics from the nexus of water, weather and climate, to each vital process involving water in all three phases including evaporation, precipitation, runoff, river flows and then to related extreme events, such as flooding and drought. This course is interdisciplinary. In additional to basic physical understanding, we will also cover classical statistical tools and state-of-the-art data science techniques for each designated topic, such as basic time series analysis and visualization, signal/pattern recognition and simple statistical modelling. Instructorâ€™s approval is required.",
