        "description": "The purpose of this course is to study the theoretical and practical aspects of mesh adaptivity, with particular emphasis on its application to time dependent PDEs. The course is about to get detailed formulations of r-adaptive mesh and moving mesh methods, which are used in the computational fluid dynamics. More specially, the shallow water equations, Euler equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations with possible source terms, such as gravity, will be solved numerically using the adaptive and moving-mesh methods on structured and unstructured meshes. Students should seek the course instructorâ€™s approval to take this course.",
