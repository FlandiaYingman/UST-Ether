            "comment_content": "The content is great, unlike normal business courses. It's all about real world situations, and application. This is done through case studies, written and allegedly experienced by the professors themselves. The first half is taught by Larry Franklin, who focuses on his own stories as a businessman, and this half focuses on the construction of deals and contracts. The second half is taught by Stephen Nason, who gives you a crash course on negotiations, and closing deals.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is the best part of the class. Both professors are fun and energetic, and will do their best to make the class fun. They have been teaching together for years, so I don't expect that to change in the near future. Just be prepared to speak up.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading can be confusing, as it is composed of exams, projects as well as in class participation. Can be very good for you if you speak enough, could also be terrible for you if you don't participate enough. Would not anticipate anyone getting a grade below the B range.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is very heavy compared to other courses. There is a lot of reading, and by a lot, I mean cases ranging from a few pages to 70 pages. These cases must be finished every class, and you are supposed to come to class prepared in case of cold calls from the professor, but also to get the sweet participation points. The projects are also very tough, especially later on in the course. If you are put into a weak group (exchange students that have better things to do than be in class), then you are in for quite the ride.",

            "comment_content": "This course was divided into 2 parts. The first half was taught by Franklin (making deals) while the second taught by Nason (closing deals/negotiation). Arguably the most challenging course offered by the undergraduate business school as it is a shortened version of an MBA course.<br /><br />First Half: You'd need to buy a thick binder of case materials (~HKD 300) from Franklin. It's filled with deals that he worked on, including Tsingtao Brewery's IPO (first of its kind). He'd walk through one case per week, and he would do it through recreating the scenes. He'd ask the class tricky questions and expect nothing but 'smart' answers, which usually require creativity and business acumen. Within the first week, teams would be formed and each assigned a case. After the second week, teams would start to present their cases in the first half of the class, while Franklin would walk through the 'correct'/ his way of approaching the case in the second half.<br /><br />Second Half: Just like any negotiation classes, Nason would give out a case each week. The first class of the week would be a negotiation session while the second one would be a reflection/lecture session. Apply what you have learned (BATNA, horse trade, etc) and try to close every deal (i.e. avoid no deal) that is within ZOPA. There would be several MC quizzes.",
            "comment_teaching": "Franklin does not tolerate illogical answers. You don't have to be super business-savvy to take the course. But your answers have to make sense when answering his questions. And the key to high marks is to think like LARRY FRANKLIN.<br /><br />Nason is very friendly. Just work hard and do what he told. You'd be fine.",
            "comment_grading": "It varies. Not bad.",
            "comment_workload": "Depends on how much you want to get out of it. After all, it is a MBA-level course. If you want to get the most out of it, you have to do a lot of preparatory work before class. Or you may choose to be like the exchange students who just slack around. It's up to you.",

In the first part of the course, you are with Professor Franklin going through a business case class, and in the second half with Professor Nason doing different negotiations. <br /><br />There is a midterm exam for the different business cases. It's not very hard if you have been paying attention and reading the cases. The final exam is an essay on an international negotiation.",
