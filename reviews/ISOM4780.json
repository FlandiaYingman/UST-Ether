(mean: 9.1)<br />His standard is similar with Marketing course (e.g. the ppt style, can't look at script) After presentation will have Q&amp;A (if no classmate hv question then he will ask it.) But it is nice that no report is required.<br /><br />- Final Exam 50%<br />my score: 46.8/50 (mean: 42.1)<br />Open book, you can open the slides. It is unexpectedly easy that as long as you ctrl + F, and find the corresponding formula, you will get the answer.
