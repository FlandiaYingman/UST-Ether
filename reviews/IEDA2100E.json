            "comment_content": "This course is a project based course that literally just throw out a task and require us students to form groups to produce a prototype for solving the task all along from zero. <br /><br />First part would be doing a proposal, which is also a good way to get to know your groupmates and what you are doing. There would be a draft Proposal stage, which will also be marked.<br /><br />Second Part is when we have to really make our hands dirty and construct the prototype, I actually got carried by my teammates that most knowledge required in the prototype are what they are familiar with. The midterm review and the final are chance to show the instructor and the special guest how your prototype works to solve the problem of the case.<br /><br />Third Part is the Learning Portfolio that is your own work. I strongly recommend recording the learning process, it would be great evidence and content to add on the portfolio.<br /><br />Hope I do not miss anything. In a nutshell, this is kind of the most meaningful course I have ever taken in UST as it provides very good opportunities to learn and apply the knowledge.",
            "comment_teaching": "Basically you have to learn a lot by yourself, including what techniques should be used to fulfill the requirements as well as learning those techniques. The Instructors will just take the role of guiding and monitoring the whole process. Professor So is very kind in my own opinion, though.",
            "comment_grading": "It is good grade for me. The grading scheme are as follows:<br /><br />Project Reports - 27%<br />Prototype - 30%<br />Learning Portfolio - 28%<br />Course Participation - 9%<br />Peer Evaluation - 6%<br /><br />So basically group work accounts for about 60% of the total mark, and if you are really working actively and really contributes something I guess a higher-than-B range will be guaranteed.",
            "comment_workload": "I guess the workload depends on the teammates, I try my best to contribute for the team while I still feel that I am being hard carried by my fellow teammates. Despite much learning process are supposed to be at home like coding and some other software stuffs, it is unavoidable that it is necessary to get back to UST labs to experiment on the module. Hence I would say the workload is pretty fair to me. <br /><br />Apart from the group task, there will be other kind of documentary work like the Individual Learning Portfolio, which requires you to kind of log your learning process throughout the course. <br /><br />To Conclude, it will be over 3 credits workload but it is much more meaningful comparing to traditional courses.",
