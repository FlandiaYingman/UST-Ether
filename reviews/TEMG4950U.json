        "name": "Special Project: Go Paperless Behavior Change Consultancy for HKJC, Sponsored by IBM GBS",
        "description": "This is an experiential learning course where student-consultants will engage with the client, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC), to develop a bespoke consulting report on organizational behavior change strategies to “Go [Almost] Paperless”. Students will work in teams, guided by the course instructor and mentored by IBM Global Business Services (IBM GBS) consultants. Before meeting the client, students will receive training on management consulting methods, conduct survey on best practices in work place digitization programs and technologies, and become familiar with the client’s company, organization business capabilities and culture. The consulting engagement has key milestones such as project kick-off, engagement sign-off, client interviews, preliminary report review and final report presentation before a panel of judges from the two corporate sponsors. The best consulting teams will present the final report to HKJC’s Sustainability Executive Committee. IBM GBS will offer suitable students summer internship, one-year placement, or a full‐time position for the following summer. Enrollment in the project course requires approval of the course instructor.",
