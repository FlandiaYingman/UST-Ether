We suggested multiple means for the him to solve this issue, such as putting on a earphone with mic instead of directly speaking to the computer. However, the lecturer REFUSED to take any of our suggestion, causing half the lecture being muted. It was not a isolated incident, but occurs in EVERY LECTURES! It was unacceptable that the lecturer even BLAMED US FOR THE PROBLEM! He said and I quote, &quot;when I check the zoom recordings, the audio was fine&quot;. Ironically, he was then immediately muted for over half a minute.<br /><br />Apart from the recurring audio problem, the lecturer is reluctant to share any information about the course's assessments. Students' request for answers for quizzes and assignments were refused by the lecturer. Requests for explanations regarding certain questions in the quizzes were DIRECTLY IGNORED by the instructor. The instructor was also unwilling to share information of our performances in quizzes, assignments and lab reports, making it very difficult for students to assess their performances.<br /><br />LEUNG, Anthony<br />Can feel his passion for teaching.

(So you can spend more time to study other two engineerings)<br /><br />Geotechnical engineering: The content is all related to rock and soil ,like earthquake or landslide etc. Or how to construct the fundamental structure of a building .This engineering will talk about many disaster events( Events from HK is important) .<br /><br />You will understand what a geotechnical engineer does after listening to this engineering section.<br /><br />This part of calculation need time to understand ,but once you understand ,you would be easy to deal with. It also related to physics.<br /><br />Environmental engineering: This part is mainly related to CHEMISTRY. It teaches you how environmental engineer protect environment and the job detail in a construction(e.g. to test the ground soil whether it is suitable for construction) It also learns other things, like noise pollution ,air pollution and solid waste etc.<br /><br />SOME calculations from this part are quite hard to understand BUT easy to do in exam. As in exam ,the calculation will only ask you the simplest version of those calculations. So if you don’t understand ,just try to memorise them.<br /><br /><br />The reason why giving C to content is because I hate memorising.",
            "comment_teaching": "In my opinion ,three professors are quite good at teaching.

And I want to say that the geotechnical engineering professor is so nice ,it is because late submission is unacceptable but the professor has accepted my apology and allowed me to resubmit it WITH 20% mark reduction. Only the geotechnical engineering assignment was required to handin at 6pm while other two are before 12am ,so REMEMBER to handin geotechnical one on time!!!<br /><br />For my lab ,one of the lab is full mark and one is at lower quartile.<br /><br />For exam ,to be honest ,Since geotechnical engineering part is quite challenge for me and of course there are also some questions from the other two parts I don’t know how to do . So I am pessimistic for my final grade . However ,the final grade is A ,far higher then my expectation(expect around B or highest is B+)<br /><br />The only suggestion here for you is to study at least one weeks before the exam as it has many things to memorise.",

Most of the questions could refer to the source. The teammates I meet are all excellent. We all book a time after the lab session and finish it together with our handwriting and our thinking. Only meet a bad free rider. But that's ok.<br />Assignment ( 6 * 4% = 24 %). Three topics and two assignments per topic. The assignment is not so difficult, and you can also refer to the source.<br />Final Exam ( 56% ). If you want to get a good mark, please take time to remember all the things in ppt. REMEMBER: ALL THE THINGS IN PPT. Don't miss any corner. It really takes time. So please fighting. I spend more than 1 week to take notes and remember the knowledge.<br />There are not a wide gap in assignment and lab session. Actually I didn't do well in some of my assignment. So the grade greatly depends on the final exam. But fortunately I get a A+. This course is really famous for its good grade. I believe it!!!!!",

The most time-consuming parts are the discussion questions which involve essay-like responses, which information requires online research and could not be found in any lecture slides.<br /><br />Also, since the report is essentially a group project in which the teammates are assigned randomly, you need to pray for competent groupmates that pull their weight or bite the bullet and complete the majority of it alone.<br />(I had one groupmate that would just copy from CHero and the content would get flagged by MSWord's similarity checker, plus adding irrelevant answers not responding to the question.

            "comment_workload": "I would say very light workload.<br /><br />For this 2-hour course, I attended the first part of the course very often. From time to time I feel bored and found meaningless to attend the following lessons and I chose to skip the rest of them. <br /><br />For assignments, not time-consuming and similar examples are shown in lecture notes. If you have sources, you find an easier way to master the assignments!<br /><br />For lab sessions, please be reminded that you must attend the two chosen labs; otherwise you will get a Fail. I chose structural and geotechnical labs. Structural lab is a group project, you just have to complete some diagrams, simple calculations and explanations. Easy! Geotechnical lab is an individual lab, it mostly requires you to compare different tests and suggest solutions. If you have sources of labs, there is no big difference which you can just find the right answers easily. <br /><br />For final exam, since this is a MC-based exam, you just have to revise all the content in the lecture notes. If you have time, find more information about geotechnical engineering. As mentioned, it is easy to kill the part about Structural Engineering as you only have to mention the bold, highlighted red words. As for other parts, you may easily find answers because the options are quite different. More to add is that you sometimes have to infer the answers when you come across the overwhelming words. Better not leave early, try your best to guess the answers by elimination. Take it easy and spend more time on revision before the final exam!!!",

Prof. Lo loves to give extra info that are not included in the lecture notes and these info will be included in finals as well, so you should not skip her lectures.<br /><br />Labs are all well-prepared and i enjoyed them a lot. They facilitate my understanding of the topic. The TAs are all helpful and some of them will explain the theory behind by demostration if you have any questions.",

Again, try to score higher marks, at least 95/100, some people could get full marks.<br /><br />Final:<br />all mcq, easy job. Memorzie the lecture notes you could already a-, mainly focus on the features of well-known buildings and bridges, such as length, the reasons behind the fatal failures. CALCULATION IS NEEDED!!!! but they are easy if you have revised the assignments. <br /><br />I got A+ in this course but I didnt get high marks in assignments and lab reports, so i think final determines your fate.",

It is basically sub-divided into 3 parts:<br />(1)Civil and Structural<br />(2)Environmental<br />(3)Geotechnical<br />Each part is delivered by a completely separated team of lecturer and TAs. Because it is an intro course, lots of factual content are covered and you are expected to memorize most of them. But never mind, if you are really interested and really do attend lectures, it will not be a difficult task to recall facts during your revision and final exam.",

But they are able to arouse my interest towards the specific field in civil engineering<br /><br />Contrastingly, Zhang is one of the most boring lecturers I have ever met in my uni life, with the most monotonic voice and reading aloud his ppt all through his lectures. People are either sleeping or playing games during his lectures. But don't worry, even if you don't attend any of his lectures, you will still be able to answer all his final exam questions given you read through his notes.",

All people literally performed similarly in lab and assignment. That's why your focus should be the final exam. And the rumour was true: you have to memorize a lot of weird facts, like how tall is the tallest building in the world, how long is Tsing Ma Bridge.... It is hard to imagine that such questions would appear in a uni course exam, but they did.<br />So be prepared!",

In every lesson, you have to learn some facts and calculations.

Of course, the Hong Kong's building is the concern of this part. Also, some failures in structural engineering are also mentioned.<br />Environmental engineering:<br />&quot;Green...Green and Green!&quot; said by prof. Kuang again! You learned 4 kinds of pollution. They are water pollution, air pollution, sound pollution and land pollution. Prof. Lo will tell you the source of the 4 pollutions and the solutions for each of them. For mathematic parts, you will learn how to calculate the sound level and questions related to the water plant.<br />Geotechnical engineering:<br />Earthquakes, solidification, rocks and landslides are mentioned in this part.

Perhaps he did not care much whether we listened to him or not, even if the class was chatting loudly that almost covered his voice. Despite he still used everyday examples to illustrate the engineering concepts like pinned support was equivalent to a pencil case cover which could rotate only. <br /><br />Prof. Lo did care whether we were concentrating in class so she often wanted us to remain silence when she was talking. Her performance was normal to good. The only downside was she did not mention some Chemistry background knowledge but we needed it for assignments and examinations. Therefore we need to find those knowledge on Internet beforehand.<br /><br />Prof. Leung should be the best professor among three. Not only did he make hilarious jokes during classes, but also reminded us in his first lesson that no late submission was allowed, the due time of the assignments differed from the previous two (From 23:59 to 18:00 for the same day).",

Also searching the chemical terms on Internet was necessary. This was significant for both environmental ones(3-4) as they involved some Chemistry: conversion of units.<br /><br />Yet it was unfortunate that assignments 5-6 contained tricky questions that sources could not come into play. Therefore both of got got far below mean.<br /><br />For laboratories, most of the questions were difficult that lecture notes could not help. Therefore paraphrasing the wordings of source or searching the Internet for authoritative sources like official/governmental organisations are recommended.<br /><br />My grades: Structural:7.9/8 (group) (mean:7.84/8)<br />Environmental:74/74 (group) (mean:73/74)<br />Fortunately I did not have free riders in my groups!<br /><br />Final exam contained 80 MCs. It would be a piece of cake for structural and geotechnical as they were all straightforward if you memorised the details well. Yet I was kinda surprised of environmental part that the calculation questions were confusing as they were not kinda mentioned in lecture notes, or required to be flexible. Overall they were in easy to normal difficulty. <br /><br />Final exam did not provide scores<br /><br />Final grade:A",
            "comment_workload": "For assignments &amp; lab reports, having sources would be an advantage but in late November my source link was disabled ......too bad. Even if you don't have sources, search those keywords that you can't understand into the internet.<br /><br />For final examinations, study lecture notes as soon as possible because they were large in amount. Otherwise you may panic.",

Irene is supportive and experienced given she stayed in the department for almost 30 years.<br /><br />I only attended the two compulsory lab sessions, the structural and environmental labs.

The lab reports were done with a group of 4-5 students. You can make references from the sources or websites for answering the lab questions. Some calculations, graph plotting, assumptions and open-ended questions. Just try answering in detail and make good division of labor with the groupmates, then no big deal (you know what I mean)<br /><br />Personally not recommend the geotechncial lab since it required individual work and the lab was conducted in November, the weeks that most students were working on LANG essays, presentations and revision.

Civil and Structural Engineering<br />開頭講下civil d background, 之後就開始講structural d野e.g. 計moment force果d<br />有讀過下physics呢part應該輕鬆渡過<br /><br />2. Geotechnical Engineering<br />講下d石頭泥土咁, 又有講下點預防山泥傾瀉果d<br /><br />3. Environment Engineering<br />講下唔同污染(solid waste, water pollution, noise, air pollution)",

Lab Reports 30%<br />3揀2 一group人做, 我就揀左structural + environmental, 聽人講geo = 靚grade之選<br />都係果句, 有source = 9成分以上<br /><br />3. Class Quiz 24%<br />每堂最尾都有個quiz, total 6個, 每個4%, 建議組隊<br /><br />4. Final 22%<br />err... 溫下書背下野就得<br /><br />今個sem我就overall 90%左右 拎A-, 有同伴一齊就相當輕鬆",
