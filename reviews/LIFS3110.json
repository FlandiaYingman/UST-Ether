Although the contents aren't directly related to the lab session, i strongly recommend you to attend as they would be tested in the final exam.",

The grading is far more lenient than i thought. My group got marks deducted from lab performance for 2-3 times, lab worksheet on average scored around 70-80%, and left ~30% of the final exam blanked, but still got A range at last.<br />Final exam was disastrous. Short questions consisted of 40%, and the remaining 60% were long questions. No MCQ at all. You have to recite the lab manual and prelab powerpoint in details in order to answer short questions. Long questions only tested for materials taught in tutorial class. They tested for your understanding and application of the technology and it's totally different from the short questions. Simply reciting the tutorial materials had no use at all. As i skipped most of the tutorial class, i found the questions very difficult.",
