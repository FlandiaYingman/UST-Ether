            "comment_content": "Listed in the Materials Option of MECH curriculum, MECH 3020 is an extension of the contents covered in MECH 2040.<br /><br />Chapter 1 –Review of solid mechanics I<br />Chapter 2 – Stress and strain transformation and failures<br />Chapter 3 - Torsion of noncircular bar and hollow shafts<br />Chapter 4 - Eccentric axial loading and Un-symmetric bending<br />Chapter 5 – Design of beams in bending<br />Chapter 6 - Shearing stress in beams &amp; thin-walled members<br />Chapter 7 – Deflection of beams<br />Chapter 8 – Energy methods<br /><br />Majority of the contents are just the remaining parts of the textbook called 'Mechanics of Materials' by Beer, Johnston, which is used in MECH 2040. The rest is from a harder textbook called 'Advanced Mechanics of Materials' by Boresi. It talks about the theory of elasticity and harder topics in Solid Mechanics (and this part is the 'real' solid mechanics IMO). In the exams and assignments, most of the contents are from the first textbook, which is a bit easier.<br /><br />Overall, the contents are interesting, but maybe it's an elective course and due to the instructor, not many ppl choose this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "TAO, Hong's teaching... Worse than her other two courses (2410 and 3420). Her style is to mostly read from the ppt slides and no additional contents or elaboration from her lectures. This is ok as I know that other profs also had this style. <br /><br />But one thing I can't tolerate. Whenever she went to the next slide, she always stuck at there for at least 10 seconds. 10 seconds dead air every slide! How come! Did she prepare well before the lecture? Or the slides are not prepared by her?<br /><br />But I still attend the lectures to show her respect and don't let the whole classroom empty. Sometimes when the class starts, only one student (me) appear in the classroom. Just don't want her feel too sad because of her below par teaching XD<br /><br />But obviously I need to self study throughout the whole course, and luckily the resources are enough for self study.",

And the grade is great.<br /><br />My grades:<br />Assignments: all full<br />Midterm: 96/100 (mean 78.4, highest 100, lowest 50, no sd)<br />Final: not released, but should be ok<br /><br />Grade: A+<br /><br />Midterm is easy, which mostly involves calculation, while Final focuses on both calculation and concepts. This result is expected as I put a lot of time self studying and doing the past paper given by the prof.",
