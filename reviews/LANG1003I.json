Each group needs to choose a social issue and then make a video to introduce problem and give solution. The score of your group video mainly depends on speaking skills, video editing skills and content.<br /><br />Content;<br />1. Whether you do research enough.<br />2.

Also, I do not like online lesson because of less engagement.<br /><br />I think Bruce Ma is willing to pay time and effort and nearly all of his every lesson were overran. Sometimes he told student to answer questions, in order to make sure that students can understand. Moreover, he often sent email to provide additional information, which shows he took our study seriously.<br /><br />However, sometimes he informed us&quot; some requirements of homework were changed&quot; so late. For example, the deadline is 5/5 and he just told us on 4/5. Therefore, I was forced to redo homework.",

Plus, you have to edit the video, like making sound sync with video and make a turning point. After that, if one of your teammates does not satisfy with the video, you need to do it again, which costs your extra time.<br /><br />Of course you can choose not to add any effect, which saves lots of time but I am afraid that your grade will be lower.<br /><br />Content:<br />I think it depends on whether you are willing to read the article carefully and then judge whether it can be the source. To be honest, it really costs time and patience.<br /><br />Moreover, I think luck is also a factor. If you can find the source that is reliable and relative to your topic on the first page of search engine, then congratulation! Otherwise, you need to pay a long period of time on searching source and it is not guaranteed that you can find it.",
