There are a lot of real-life decision-making problems (e.g., business, logistics, economics, marketing, finance, resource management, forecasting and engineering) which can be formulated using some existing data analysis models. Existing computer science tools such as Microsoft Excel can help us to model and solve these problems easily, and to visualize the solutions.",

            "comment_content": "Let me put this straight, many courses deserve their hate (looking at you, phys1112), but this is definitely not one of them. Therefore, this review is to counteract the negative review, and this review might be in a slightly overly positive tone, but I promised you, this is indeed a great course.<br /><br />Content:<br />1. Association (Apriori Approach, FP-growth Approach)<br />2.Clustering (k-mean, dendrogram)<br />3.classification (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, NN Classifier, Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, SVM)<br />4. PCA<br />5. Data Warehouse<br />6. Web Database<br /><br />Never heard of these materials? Me neither!<br />However, don't get discouraged by these topics that sound difficult, they are not as horrendous as they appeared to be. Most of the topics could be easily comprehended and understood after you attended the lessons (maybe with the exception of PCA, which is quite confusing for me). After you learnt about these concepts, you should be able to grasp an idea about data handling.",
            "comment_teaching": "Raymond is a great teacher. After the lesson, he will stay to answer any confusion about the course material, and he will not end the lesson until every questions got answered. And if you have questions after the lesson, just connect him through email, he will provide in-depth and detailed answer pretty quickly. <br /><br />There is a unique policy about the course, which is the existence of &quot;coupon&quot;, which has two usages. <br />Firstly, it could be used to waive one question in an assignment, you would automatically obtained full points for that question whether your answers are correct or not (you can even not answer the question at all). This would come in handy when you feel struggling about a certain question, or you are rushing the assignment before the deadline and realise that you could not finish all of them on time (definitely not personal experience).<br />Secondly, it could help you to automatically obtain full mark in one part of the project, which would be otherwise hard if you do not use the coupon.<br /><br />There are mainly two ways to obtain the coupon, which are through answering Raymond's questions during the lesson, or providing solution for the &quot;in-class exercise&quot; (further discussed in 'workload'). However, don't worry if you feel you could not raised hand to answer question quick enough or not smart enough to complete the &quot;in-class&quot; exercise. Towards the end of the semester, Raymond would start to ask students whether they have coupons or not, and if you don't, he would give you opportunities to answer his questions. Therefore, you are almost guaranteed to at least have one coupon (which is highly encouraged to be used in project).",
            "comment_grading": "Assignment 10%<br />Project 20%<br />In-class Participation(I.e. iPRS and attendance) 10%<br />Mid-Term Exam 20%<br />Final Exam 40%<br /><br />For assignment and project, they are not difficult to obtain high score as long as you are willing to put some effort, as the markings are quite lenient.<br />For In-class participation, erm, sleep well and don't wake up late, I guess?<br /><br />For examination, there are quite a few points to be discussed.<br /><br />The examination method: Raymond would allow students to vote for their desired exam method (letting us to choose the mark distribution for MC and long/short questions, ranging from 0% to 100%). For midterm, people choose 50% of MC and 50% of long/short questions, and many were disappointed with it as they feel like the MC part was difficult. As a result, the final exam consist of only long/short questions and no MC. I was in the minority side of this situation as I preferred some MCs, but hey, to each their own, and so I would just try to give some objective description about the MCs and long/short questions, and it is left for you to decide how you want your exam to be.<br />MC: the MC would consist of some conceptual questions, some standard question that require moderate level of calculation, and some questions that are actually compressed long question that you would need to go through like a normal long question to get the desired answer (which I think are the reason of MC being considered difficult). <br />Long/short questions: The long/short questions are mostly standard and straightforward questions that revolve about the taught materials, which are mostly extremely similar(or even identical) to past paper or exercises given during lessons, some questions that required proof(most are mentioned during class), and some unseen explanation question that test your understanding about the course (which are the questions that distinguish the level of students). Long/short questions would allow you to obtain at least some score as long as you write some steps, but it would be more lengthy to complete one question as you need to write a lot of words, which might cause you to have less than sufficient time to complete the whole paper.<br /><br />Little tips about the exam: <br />1. DO THE PAST PAPER AND IN-CLASS EXERCISE! This is the utmost important tip. There are many similar questions between the past paper/in-class exercise and the actually exam paper, so as long as you complete those things and memorize how to do them, you should be fine. <br />2. Remember the proof. There are few proofs about the materials that Raymond would bring up during the lessons, remember to copy and remember them as there is always a proof question in the exam.<br />3. Try to make some programs to help you do the calculation. (This tip might not be applicable next time this course is offered as I don't know whether the exam will still be carried out online). The exam would almost always required many calculations for some questions, which would be impossible for people to finish manually within the time limit. Therefore, you should make some programs that help you do those tedious calculations. Don't worry if you do not have any programming background, Excel could do the same computations after you put formula into the cells.<br /><br />The grade (total, mean, sd)<br />Midterm: (100, 61.41, 15.02)<br />Final exam:(200, 117.42, 38.46)<br />Assignments have mean ~90/100 and project has mean ~95/100<br />I got +1.3sd for midterm and +1.0sd for final, and got an A.<br />But before you boo me and call me biased, may I mentioned that there are reports of people that got mean in final yield an B+, and people that get -0.5sd for final yield an B. So I think it is not a lie that the course has good grade.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not that heavy, for the whole semester, there are only 2 homework and a project.<br /><br />HW: for the homework, there will be one before the midterm exam and one after the midterm exam, which test your knowledge about the course materials, each of them consist of four to five questions. For a slow learner like me, I can complete it within about five hours, i.e. one hour for each question (but you need to take consideration that I often missed the lessons and would just learn the material when I do the homework), which is relatively small workload when compared to its deadline (about two months each). <br /><br />Project: Most workload of the course comes from the project. The project could be done in group of two or one(i.e. only yourself). The project consist of three phases, which as long as you follow Raymond's guidance, would be very easy to obtained full score. As a matter of fact, the mean of the project is more than 90%. For the whole project, as a one man group, I worked about three days, which again might seem much, but is actually quite light given the lenient deadline. <br /><br />In-class exercise(Optional): In-class exercises are given by Raymond during a lesson, which would be discussed in the next lesson. If you are confident, for the next lesson, you could arrive the class a bit earlier and show your answer to Raymond, if it is correct, you could obtain a &quot;coupon&quot;. However, this is totally optional and I personally never did the In-class exercise before revisions for the exams. <br /><br />Special mention: attendance. Although the course should returned to face-to-face next semester, I think this semester attendance record system are still worth to mention. Your attendance will be recorded if you upload a screenshot of the lesson after the class. Also, during the lesson, there will be some iPRS questions that would grant you mark as long as you answer them (regardless of whether your answer is correct).",

However, I encourage you not to directly copy since the assignments are meant to be practices of the course materials, which are useful to consolidate the concepts. <br /><br />For the project, there are three phrases, if you follow the deadlines and guidelines by Prof Wong strictly, you will be fine and get full marks.",

The final question involve solving a system of linear equations (instead of simple arithmetic in previous semesters). I am bad with those maths and made careless mistakes in calculation costing me 10 points in final. And also another 6 point because not finishing the clustering in time due to that equation solving. It seems the paper test your maths and time management skills instead of your knowledge about the topics. <br /><br />HW: 10/10<br />Project: 20/20<br />IPRS: 10/10<br />Midterm: 93.75/100 (Mean: 65.76/100, SD: 15.88) =&gt; 18.75/20<br />Final: 175/200 (Mean: 125.33/200, SD: 30.03) =&gt; 35/40<br />Overall Grade: A<br /><br />+1.7 sd in both midterm and final still yields an A. I don't think that can be classified as a good grade course, right?<br /><br />EDIT: Please don't get me wrong. To be fair, this is not a bad grade course, and there are much more courses with grading worse than that. Based on past experience and other reviews (in previous offerings of this course and other courses), +1.0~1.2 sd should at least yield an A-, +1.3~1.5 sd should at least yield an A, and +1.6~1.7 sd should at least yield an A+ for a course with better grading. What I really meant is the grading scheme is not as good as before, and it is still reasonable in some sense.",

You have to capture screenshots for ALL steps of building your classification model so the TA can follow exactly what you performed.<br /><br />For exam preparation, doing 4 years of past paper should be sufficient for getting a decent grade.

            "comment_teaching": "Explanation of concepts:<br />To be honest, the lecture notes were a bit messy, but Raymond explained the concepts very clearly by using Zoom annotation and Microsoft Whiteboard. He used in-class exercises to ensure that we understood what he taught.<br /><br />The speed of replying email:<br />The speed of reply always shocks me because Raymond replies to emails insanely quickly. One of the experiences is that he replied to my email within 10 minutes after I had sent it to him and the content of his email was longer than I expected.<br /><br />Accent:<br />Raymond has a bit heavy Cantonese accent, but it is acceptable generally because he repeated the content and concepts quite many times.<br /><br />TA Team:<br />It is worth praising all the TAs in this course because they were efficient, which I did not expect. They replied to emails quickly and released the scores of assessments (including mid term and final exam) within 48 hours.<br /><br />Freedom/Flexibility of mid term and final exam:<br />We could vote on the format of Mid Term and Final Exam, such as the length, difficulty, and bonus-questions-or-not of exams.<br /><br />By the way, I think Raymond (Prof. Wong) may be one of the best professors/lecturers in UST because he really spends time on teaching and taking care of students inside and outside of the learning aspect.",

He will show you the algorithms step by step and explain it to the students so that I think it should be no problem for most of students to understand the contents in lecture even you don't have any computer science background.<br /><br />Raymond welcome students to ask question freely during the lecture. If you have questions just raise hand and ask him. He is willing to answer all kinds of questions. <br /><br />During the lecture, Raymond will give &quot;coupon&quot; to those who have answered his questions. 1 Coupon can be used to waive 1 question from a homework to get full mark. Also, it can be used to waive the prediction result part in the project, which means you can directly get full score even your prediction result in the project is a crap (or you can even not hand in the prediction text file :D).<br /><br />Don't worry that you cannot get a coupon from Raymond lecture as he will ask many questions during the lecture time and most of them are very easy even primary students can answer them. So don't be afraid of it. Besides, Raymond will send email to ask those students who have no coupon to register and let them answer the questions sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can take the chance of this to get a coupon for your project if your hand speed is not as fast as other students in the class.<br /><br />Raymond powerpoint usually consist of many slides to show you how to use XLMiner step by step. But I think many of them are actually redundant and can be simplified. So don't be scared by a vast amount of powerpoint slides, most of them are just XLMiner demonstration part :D",

It is recommended to use some program or excel(?) to help you solving the question. Otherwise it is quite impossible to finish the whole paper in the final exam.<br /><br />You can expects the participation, homework and project mean is around 90-95%. So the things determine your grade is midterm and final.<br /><br />Getting +1.3 sd from midterm and +1.5 sd from final giving me an A+, which is not very useful for general grading. You can refer to other review to know more about the grading. I believed that the grading is generally good.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is mainly come from the exam, homework and project.<br /><br />There are 2 homeworks in this semester, each of them gives you nearly 1 month to finish (maybe?). You are definitely having enough time to finish it on time. The questions are not difficult, but require repetitive calculation and long steps, which may cause you to have careless mistakes. Be careful of it.<br /><br />The project is not difficult also. You can form 1-2 people in a group to finish it. <br />Phase 1 is handing in a Excel file which is adding the column names to the data in txt tile originally. You can finish it within 10 minutes. <br />Phase 2 is handing in the design report. You need to give 5 models to do your prediction. For each of the model, you need to clearly write down the parameters and steps so that TA can follow what are you doing exactly. It is not difficult but may cost you some time because you need to do many screenshot D:<br />Phase 3 is the final report. You just need to add the results from each of your model in phase 2 and write down the conclusions. Again it is not difficult. Generally I just copy and paste the results of my model and change some wording to finish this part.<br /><br />It is easy and your report just follow the format given by Raymond then it is okay. You don't need to consider the design and formatting of the report.",

The course content is quite interesting in some ways and allows students with no computer science background to understand and possibly be able to communicate (if you understand the course) with others on data mining. There is no coding or any sort of understanding of it for this course.<br />On another note, some of the content of this course could really be used in real life or at least understand parts about the real life. For example, one of the data mining methods (Principal Component Analysis) requires the calculation of the Eigenvalues which basically allowed me to say &quot;Ayyy.. I know that&quot; when I was watching Avengers Endgame.",

While he obviously can't give every student an A+, he has provided as much support as he could to help students understand the course and gain extra credit. The way to gain extra credits was so easy it would be stupid not to go for it.<br />Even though the professor's teaching was very good, his teaching assistants were as passionate nor cared about the students as much. They basically read off the powerpoint and made no efforts in making the tutorials more interesting. So I don't really see a point of going to the tutorials since you can just read the tutorial notes yourself.",

And for a student without any knowledge in the area, it could be intimidating to see someone code in the lecture theatre. But don't worry, you aren't competing with those guys, there is no way you can beat them with the same effort they put in the course.",
            "comment_workload": "The assignment workload could get a bit much if you don't properly organize your time throughout the semester especially if you don't understand the course content very well.<br />The project workload is pretty chill, you basically just follow the steps given and you will score a 100% no problem. So for most time, relax and organize your time to finish the work. Professor Raymond normally sends out reminders letting the students know the different milestones in class thus allowing students to do the assignment questions right after the lecture while the knowledge is still fresh.",

The concept itself may feel difficult at first, but if you listen to the lectures, the professor makes the course material understandable (which you don't see too much often here at HKUST).",

He is very open to questions, so if you email him about any question, he will respond extremely quickly. (BTW I don't think he sleeps early. His emails come at like 1,2 am in the morning)<br /><br />There are some math involved in the course and because he knows most students cannot follow, he slows down and explains the same thing many times. (Especially at the first few lectures in association rule, he will repeat the calculation like four times. But later he will speed things up a little bit...)<br /><br />Some people might find his accent/pronunciation funny. He pronounces &quot;sheet&quot; in a very concise way, and he uses the word &quot;coupon&quot; a lot and it sounds like &quot;Q-pon&quot;.",
            "comment_grading": "Just like any COMP classes, the grading is very objective. If you deserve 100, the professor and TAs will give you a 100. <br /><br />I suggest that when you get your assignment scores, project scores, exam scores, you should take a look and talk to the professor if you think you deserve more points. The professor is open to changing scores if you deserve more (and if you can elaborate your answers).<br /><br />Project: 100/100<br />Midterm: 97/100 (was 94)<br />Final: 195/200 (was 189)<br />Participation: 10/10<br />Assignment 1: 10/10 (was 9.5)<br />Assignment 2: 9.6/10 (was 9.0)<br /><br />I don't know what my letter grade is yet but probably many other students have high scores as well. <br /><br />The mean scores are: <br />Project: 90.79/100 (SD: 19.90)<br />Midterm: 69.49/100 (SD: 17.12)<br />Final: 151.57/200 (SD: 36.63)<br /><br />The rest I don't know. He will probably provide those numbers if you email him.",
            "comment_workload": "Not too much. <br /><br />There is a participation score but you just need to have 20 units of iPRS questions, which is easy to get. You don't have to go to every single lecture. Some lectures have 3 iPRS questions so by the end of the term, there is no need to go to the lectures. You can watch the video link provided by the department (which is actually better) when studying for the exams/assignments. <br /><br />Assignments are short, you can waive one question with a Q-pon. You get a Q-pon by answering questions during the lecture. You will need about 4 to go through the semester (1 per assignment/project). I ended up gathering five in the first two weeks and didn't participate after then. <br /><br />There is a project but... I don't think the grading is very harsh. Didn't expect the mean to be as high as 90.79 but it's not very difficult, just do what he teaches you in the lectures (takes about 4~6 hours I guess if you do it alone).",

            "comment_content": "An elementary level course on data mining. Topics included:<br />1. Association: Apriori, FP growth<br />2. Clustering: k-Means, hierarchical<br />3. Classification: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, concepts like true positive, accuracy, etc.<br />4. Data Warehouse<br />5. Dimension Reduction (Principal Component Analysis)<br />6. Wed Databases<br /><br />The difficulty of most contents are well-selected to be a common core level. You may feel it is a bit easy if you have a solid background on math or computer science. There are some topics that you may have not learned before (for example, basic matrix operation), but those will be covered in the tutorials.<br /><br />Using XLMiner in Excel is one of the highlights of this course. It is a tool for you to perform data mining in Excel. Some tutorials may be used to teach the way to use XLMiner. Raymond may also mention it himself during lectures.",
            "comment_teaching": "Raymond explains things quite clearly, and he is willing to answer any questions regarding the content of the course. He is probably famous for replying emails with a fast speed. In addition to that, his replies are clear and rich in content. Just read other course reviews to see how nice he is.<br /><br />I didn't attend any tutorials not about XLMiner, so I cannot give any review on that. For those tutorials about XLMiner, the TA goes through the steps of doing different data mining techniques slowly. This may be helpful if you can't really understand the procedures or you are lazy to learn it yourself.",

These coupons can allow you to waive a part of the assignments and project and guarantees a full score. Raymond will even &quot;force&quot; you to obtain some coupons at a later stage of the course, so it should be easy to obtain them.<br /><br />Getting a course total of 96.7% yields an A+. It is lucky to have an A+, but probably due to the significant increase of difficulty in the final exam. Your score is especially outstanding if you perform well in the final exam. A reminder for anyone taking this course: the time for exams this year are quite insufficient, so try to rush over the questions.",
            "comment_workload": "Assignments: I do not have &quot;sources&quot;, and it spends me about 3~5 hours for both. Some questions ask you to use XLMiner, so that may waste you a bit of time.<br /><br />Project: Not sure if I treat it too seriously, but the workload is not as light as other people suggested. Phase 1 is easy for everyone and it does not cause you more than 30 minutes. Phase 2 is the design report. Mine contains 14 pages including screenshots from XLMiner, which causes me at least 5 hours. Phase 3 is the final report, which can be based on the design report. Mine contains 21 pages including screenshots from XLMiner, which causes me 8~10 hours.",

            "comment_teaching": "In terms of teaching, Raymond has a lot of room for improvement. However, he is nice and gave me a good grade, so I will give a C here instead of E.<br /><br />Raymond is really nice and will answer your emails promptly. The teaching team is also efficient and finishes marking exams/assignments in 1-2 days.<br /><br />However, Raymond is really terrible as a teacher.<br /><br />Raymond forces you to attend nearly every lesson. You need to submit screenshots of your Zoom attendance 15 times and answer 20 IPRS questions. At 1 IPRS per lecture, you can only miss 3 or 4 lectures.<br /><br />Attending Raymond's lectures is actively detrimental to my learning progress. Once in a while, some disruptive students will ask some stupid questions and he will go out of his way to answer them. Literally, 90% of the questions raised in lectures were asked by the same single student. However, Raymond is too nice to tell him to just SHUT UP.<br /><br />Raymond also has a&nbsp;&nbsp;coupon system where you get a coupon if you answer a question in class which you can use to get full marks on a homework question. Raymond wants to give every student a chance to answer a question in class, so he goes out of his way to ask a lot of trivial questions. Interactiveness is good but Raymond is really taking it overboard to the point that it is disrupting the flow of the lecture.<br /><br />Moreover, Raymond talks so slowly that I drift off and lose focus every 10 seconds. If you are an individual of higher intelligence whose brain operates on a higher frequency and therefore prefers watching lecture videos at 2x speed, too bad! Raymond forces you to attend his lectures.<br /><br />Furthermore, Raymond has a fetish with long documents. His powerpoints will make you want to rip your eyes out. They are usually 100 slides long. He likes to animate his powerpoints FRAME BY FRAME. 80% of the slides in his powerpoints do not contain useful information. Moreover, your project report will be around 50 pages long, mostly consisting of screenshots detailing how you use the data mining tool. Therefore, you will spend more time furiously flicking your mouse scroll wheel to navigate the document instead of actually typing stuff.<br /><br />You would think a CSE professor would be more tech-savvy. While UST's LANG courses are completely useless to us undergraduates, I think Raymond will really benefit from attending a LANG course to upgrade his presentation skills.",

If no, explain.<br />A: X = 3.<br /><br />Wrong! -1 point, &quot;missing answer to yes/no question&quot;<br /><br />Welcome to North Korea!<br /><br />The exam format was highly inconsistent. The midterm was 50/50 LQ MC with NO mechanical questions that you can write programs for, while the final was 100% LQ with 2 questions worth 40% of the total solvable within 1 second with pre-written code. The midterm got me good and I barely got 50%, but luckily I had a good comeback in the final. Personally, I do not appreciate this kind of inconsistency in exam format, as students can not adequately prepare for the exam by doing past papers. This is another reason this course sucks. You never know what Raymond is going to throw at you next time.<br /><br />Statistics:<br />10% HW Full<br />10% Attendance Should be Full<br />20% Project nearly full<br />20% + 40% Midterms and Finals +0.9 SD averaged<br />-&gt;A-<br /><br />Luckily, the final is worth twice as much as the midterm, so you can make a comeback if you screw up in your midterm.<br /><br />Raymond lets us vote on the format of the exams. For the midterm, some naive kids voted for 50% Long Q 50% MC.<br />As a result, the midterm was very fun. MC is very fun because it's all-or-nothing, no partial credit. I only got 3/10 of the MC.<br /><br />Raymond also removed all MC questions from the past paper. Maybe he is too lazy to design new MC questions and reuse them every year. Too bad if you want to do past papers to prepare for the MC part!<br /><br />Finals were 100% Long Q. 10 questions 20 marks each. 2 questions can be solved with code right off the bat, so 40 marks there. For the rest, most were copied from the past papers. Raymond didn't even bother changing the numbers for one question, so I just copy-pasted the solution from a past paper. (It was open book)",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is pretty huge.<br /><br />If you want A range, you must do at least 5 or 6 past papers, and write code for every single question type. I think there are several question types but each type has a couple variations, so you will need to write a few dozen programs in total.<br /><br />Raymond sets the deadline for homeworks and project reports at 10:30 in the morning. If you are someone who cannot focus on a homework assignment unless the deadline is less than 6 hours away, your sleep schedule will suffer.<br /><br />The homeworks are time-consuming, and you need to triple-check your answers. The project report is also tedious. You need to use the data mining tool and paste screenshots of every step, i.e., every button you click.<br /><br />Projects requirements were not clearly communicated. The TAs will even penalize minor formatting mistakes. If your solution isn't a carbon copy of the official solution, you will get points deducted.",
