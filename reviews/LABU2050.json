            "comment_content": "The course mainly revolves around the art of presentation in the business world. As this course is solely taken by GBUS students, it is usually expected for students to be able to understand more than what is written in the powerpoints and course materials. Case studies and theories are the main content of the course, and they cover the psychological aspects of people in business.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor, as I understand, has a very high expectation of the students and would allow a lot of free discussion time. Nora, in particular, is more willing to let us come up with answers than directly giving it to us. It has indeed made it more difficult to complete assignments or get a good grade - but since there are usually a limited number of students in a class (12 in my class) - it definitely is a lot of fun!",
            "comment_grading": "One thing about LABU is that we don't really know the marks of our final two assignments. I believe it is, possible to ask for the grades in detail, but that itself was quite bothersome. <br /><br />As for good/bad grades? As a year 1 student who took it in the first semester, I can tell you that the standards are quite high and getting good grades could be quite challenging. Don't expect too much - just enjoy.",
            "comment_workload": "4 case studies in one semester is borderline suicide. The only thing about LABU is its super intense workload - I am completely fine with everything else. <br /><br />Basically, you could expect a presentation every week or so; and a big project every three weeks or so. It doesn't sound like a lot - but when you have to read fifteen pages of information every case study and make a 15 minute presentation every time - you would be frustrated. <br /><br />One good thing is that the work is very diversified; there is one video podcast on a global scenario, one letter on an accounting dilemma, and two presentations with one about ethics in business and the other about cultural factors in business. <br /><br />All in all, the workload is heavy, but it is definitely possible to learn a lot from it!",
