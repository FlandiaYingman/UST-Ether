A more objective comment would be a C.<br />Yes, you will only have to read the reading materials, and only write a short poem, but this is not the important part. The important part lies in the 70% in midterm and finals.<br />As someone who are not good with literature of any kind, I struggled to understand the more advanced part of this course.<br />Yes, I attended the classes and do know the definitions given by the teacher, but there are some more advanced stuff that needed more than class participation.<br />Think twice before enrolling in this course.

            "comment_content": "Yes, I know it's been four years, but I find it a cautionary tale now that I am studying a legitimate language program -<br /><br />This course requires students to read short stories, poetry, and drama. The literary period covered is wide (from ancient Greece to Shakespeare to modern literature). You'll get a taste of everything, which sacrifices the depth of analysis within each text. Also, the same texts are usually taught at the introductory or intermediate levels in language programs, meaning you'll get a taste of how literature-related courses are structured in language programs.",
            "comment_teaching": "Lisa always said literature is all about arguing your point, and there is no one definite answer in literature. However, there lacks argumentative writing in the whole course - while we were asked to share our opinions in class, most of the time the teaching would involve basic literary techniques and terminology. Personally, I found the course more restrictive that Lisa stated, especially when the assessment items were based on MCQ and short answers (which have definitive answers).<br /><br />The reason I have to write this review after four years: currently, I'm studying a complete language program. Since I studied HUMA1300, my university has transferred the introductory literature course for me. The lack of essay writing proved to be problematic in the subsequent courses (one of which I am currently taking): I had little idea on how literary analysis should be done. I had to seek my professors' consultation to have a crash course on literary analysis, reading the course materials of the introductory course I was given the transfer.<br /><br />I guess Lisa's perspective is applicable within her expertise (comparative literature), where her students are trained in academic writing. But don't expect this introductory course to be anything more, especially if you plan to further study literature courses (whether in HKUST or elsewhere).",

            "comment_content": "As previous reviews mentioned, the course is divided into three main parts: short stories, poetry and plays. Timing-wise, each component takes up around 1/3 of the time. <br /><br />As the course title suggests, it teaches basic skills of literature such as identifying different literary devices, analyzing plot, style (short stories), usage of meter, rhyming, musicality (poetry), dialogue, soliloquy, setting, emotions, and so on (plays). Of course, this is merely part of the content and it is highly recommended for you to give this course a try first. <br /><br />PS: Reading materials are great!",
            "comment_teaching": "Perhaps it comes with experience, but the overall pace of the class is comfortable. The class lasts for an hour and 20 minutes, and I believe class discussions took up more than half of the time. Lisa is patient enough for everyone to speak their minds and discuss the content of the reading materials even though we don't always make sense. <br /><br />It is quite the perfect class if you wish to learn about literature from scratch like me!",
            "comment_grading": "There are four grading components: PRS (Attendance), Mid-Term Exam, Creative Writing Assignment (Write a poem) and a Final Exam. <br /><br />PRS is simple. I am still unsure if you get the points if you got the answers wrong, but I think it's simply used to take attendance. Read the assigned materials thoroughly (should take 10 - 20 minutes for stories/plays, shorter for poems) and you'll get it right easy enough. <br /><br />Mid-term exam* was tough. Basically, it tests on everything taught in the lectures before, which in my case only included short stories. There were questions on plot, message, settings - but they are not difficult, per se. But you have to answer 5 MCs + 5 LQs in one hour, so your time management must be spot on. <br /><br />Creative Writing Assignment was fun. After learning about poems for a few lectures, you will have to start writing - your ultimate goal is to submit two drafts and a final product. Grading is quite chill (introductory course after all), so just enjoy the process. <br /><br />Final exam*: Format is the same as Mid-Term Exam. However, only content covered after the Mid-term would be tested, so you will have to know your poems and plays. Questions are rather simple, and you are given more than double the time of the Mid-Term, so study and you'll be rewarded. <br /><br />*Grading for exams are chill. Just make sure you state your key points and explain in two - three sentences. Don't overwrite!",

She tends to remember names of those who are more active in class. <br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that she didn't upload her powerpoints onto canvas which can be annoying. If you can't get all the notes written down during class, you're pretty much out of luck unless someone else wrote it down.
