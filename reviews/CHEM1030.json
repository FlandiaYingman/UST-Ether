            "comment_teaching": "Professor Jason is a good man and always keen to answer the students' questions. He sometimes shows some chemical experiments during the lectures and tries to make students understand the chemical concepts.<br /><br />However, don't know whether this is the first time for him lecturing the general chemistry II course or as his specialty is organic chemistry, not physical/inorganic chemistry which is highly related to chem 1030 contents, he made some critical mistakes in solving problems during the lecture or in tutorial videos. Several students had to point out the mistakes and correct them.<br /><br />As he is an organic chemist, some course contents are way too focused on organic chemistry, such as a curved arrow mechanism or figuring out the number of stereoisomers. <br /><br />And in chapter 7, I don't think it's necessary to cover symmetry labels and MO diagram of the octahedral case that appear in inorganic chemistry as not only chemistry students but also students from other departments attend this lecture. Rather, he should have covered crystal fields of other molecular geometries additional to octahedral.<br /><br />Some contents in this course seem too much for the general chemistry level.<br /><br />Maybe too in-depth explanations of chemical concepts and not having additional tutorial classes led to the lack of time to cover redox and electrochemistry which are somewhat important concepts to learn at the general chemistry level.",

Every student in the online lecture was like a translator, translating his &quot;Lin's English&quot;. Trust me, his English was even worse than professor Jia (another professor notorious for his English) in 1020.<br /><br />2. As mentioned in previous reviews, professor Lin assumed all of us knew everything. However, it was a year 1 course and we didn't have much profound knowledge of chemistry. For example, he always assumed us know much about the organic chemistry<br /><br />3. His teaching was confusing. An obvious example is that not the first time he said &quot;Sorry I confused myself&quot;. Making mistakes in the lesson was also not the first time. Many mistakes in teaching are reminded by the students as well (Thanks students for asking questions after class in chem 1030). I skipped lessons and did self-study most of the time via YouTube (Organic Chemistry Tutor) and the website (Khan Academy) <br /><br />4. To now, I really have no idea about the attendance score in 1030. After the final, he included the attendance score, but this really didn't reflect the real attendance of students. Some hardworking students who attended every lecture didn't get a full mark in attendance. Thanks to the students who keep on sending emails about attendance, the attendance part is cancelled. But, if you need to include attendance score, you should have talked about that at the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe there're some good things .... <br /><br />1. There're revision exercises in every lesson (all multiple choices). It is advised to capture all the MCs in the lesson as they may appear in the exam.

Even Google is allowed.<br /><br />The exam paper consists of 50% multiple choice, 30% short questions, and 20% long questions. Generally speaking, multiple choice is the trickiest part since it focuses on basic concepts.

I guess you could have known him from TV shows or other Chem Related experiments.<br />There are 7 chapters to be covered this semester, they are listed as follows:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Chemical Thermodynamics(Entropy)<br />Chapter 2: Chemical Equilibrium<br />Chapter 3: Solubility and Solution Properties<br />Chapter 4: Acids and Bases<br />Chapter 5: Chemical Kinetics<br />Chapter 6: The Main Group Elements<br />Chapter 7: Transition Metals<br /> <br />Of these 7 chapters, I would have to say that chapter 6 is one of the hardest chapters that I had ever encountered after taking CHEM1020 and CHEM1030.<br /><br />Chapter 6, like other students who wrote the review of this course, found it extraordinarily hard and arduous. Chapter 6 introduces the main group elements which span from groups 1,2,13....so on and so forth. There were lots of details to be remembered and memorized. (Like what is the cubic cell of Si, Grignard reagents and Curly arrow of how NaBH4 reduces an aldehyde&nbsp;&nbsp;) <br />Worse still, Dr, Chan didn't cover Chapter 6 last year so there was no past paper for Reference and revision.<br /><br />As for Chapter 7, there were 2 main gists in this chapter. One is Isomerism and the other is crystal field theory. Isomerism accounted for lots of points in last year's final exam. But for this year, the MO diagram of the 3d orbital splitting into eg* and t2g accounted for higher proportions in the final exam. What's strange was that we kept practicing drawing the 3d orbital of transition metals in the lectures. But what appears in the exam were MO diagrams with 4s,4p, and 3d orbital. <br /><br />These 2 chapters caused me lots of points lost in the final exam.<br /><br />Last year's past paper of final exam was provided by Prof Chan for our revision",

Most of the topics have already been covered in A Levels (the high school curriculum I took), but obviously it dives deeper into the topics. <br /><br />Chapters 1 to 5 involve lots of calculations. Be sure to frequently do the practice sets that Dr. Chan provided and the textbook questions. Practice makes perfect, I did practice sets for each chapter every day 2 weeks before the finals. It definitely paid off.<br /><br />Chapters 6 and 7 involve lots of memorisation and understanding. No calculation involved. Be sure to review the concepts taught so that you will not procrastinate before the finals.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the content of this course would be Chapter 6. Chapter 6 is just pure torture. We basically have to learn about the properties, reactions and structures of elements from Group 1 to 18. LOTS and LOTS of memorising involved. I personally think it might have been better for Dr. Chan to cover Chapter 8 instead of Chapter 6, but that's just my take on this.",

SD: 20.5)<br /><br />The final was a closed book exam. It was difficult, especially considering the fact that the time duration was honestly not enough (I finished 3 minutes before time's up). Part 1 and 2 was very doable. Part 3, on the other hand, was crazy. Split into three parts: Part 1 (MCQ), Part 2 (Case Study 1) and Part 3 (Case study 2 and 3).<br /><br />The grading for this course is quite good. My friend who got around 81-83 was able to get an A. <br /><br />The cutoff for A+ is probably around 86-88 (?). Getting an 85 would still give you an A according to another ust.space reviewer.<br /><br />My total grade for the course: 89. <br />Letter Grade: A+.",

            "comment_teaching": "Professor Lin has some accent but the explanation is very clear and understandable. He is always enthusiastic to answer any questions.<br />In the second half of the semester, I had some difficulties after the new lecturer came to teach the class, probably due to my personal problems. On the one hand, I was not quite used to the new lecturer's classroom habits, and on the other hand, I missed a few classes due to illness. As a result, I was not able to understand the content of Chapter 20 clearly at first. But later, during the final review, I read the slides and reviewed the return visits, and asked the professor and TA for advice, and I quickly understood the content.<br />The professors, assistants and TAs were all very enthusiastic. They speak Cantonese, English, and Mandarin, so it was very easy to communicate with them.<br /><br />But I still think there is room for improvement. This is a course with a very large number of students. However, a lot of local students don't listen to the class at all and like to talk to each other, which affects the class experience. So, I think we can change the rules so that instead of uploading the recordings a week later, we can upload the recordings at the same time, so that all the students who don't listen to the class don't come to the class. Otherwise, we have to waste a lot of time on maintaining order in every class. Also, the background sound of each session's recording is very noisy. Because there are a bunch of locals who don't listen to the class at all.",

I think he just keep saying things like &quot;this guy&quot;, &quot;that guy&quot;, &quot;let's say&quot;...And his English isn't very good. He didn't seem very well-prepared as he sometimes don't know whether a question on the slides have answers in the next page or not. And he made some mistakes when explaining things. (but professors all make mistakes sometimes, and he send emails to clarify his mistakes, so it's...ok, maybe)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three good things about his teaching. One is that he always give some review questions at the beginning of the lecture, and that helps to consolidate your knowledge. I screencapped all of them and they are useful for revision. Another good thing is that he gives a short break in the lecture. Thirdly, he is wililng to answer questions after lectures.

Overall, pretty good prof, pretty helpful and kind (except for exams), and he does stay behind after every lecture to answer as many questions.<br /><br />Other than that, for some reason content before the MT, he was god awful at explaining things, like it was more confusing than helping. so I just self studied everything from that point onwards.

The more correct answer you get, the higher marks you get in attendance so the 5% attendance will be given in a linear scale in class i.e. Top 20% student will get full marks and the remaining will get 4.8% - 0%) <br />- 5% Assignment 2 (Canvas typed assignment, you could complete all two attempts but only the last attempt will be kept even you score higher in first attempt, however, they won't release your score after your first attempt and questions are different in both attempts) <br />- 40% Final Exam (20% T/F, 50% MCQ, 30% entered/numerical questions. Quantitative and qualitative knowledge are equally important. Comparatively less demanding in final exam) <br /><br />Grading: <br />Overall scores 80-100%: A range (15.7% of students)<br />Overall scores 66-79%: B range (31.8% of students)<br />Overall scores 45-65%: C range (46.1% of students) <br />Overall scores 38-44%: D (4.8% of students) <br />Overall scores below 38%: F (1.5% of students)",

Go watch Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube and doing exercises provided in textbook are more effective than listening in lectures as you won't be able to understand the concepts anyway.",

            "comment_content": "The course covers topics that students more or less have some basic ideas from HKDSE Chem. It is kinda like an extension of a few DSE topics which includes some A-level stuffs. Not a difficult course, but make sure you really understand the concepts taught. I think students who are interested in chemistry would be interested in this course :)<br /><br />1) Topics included in the mid-term exam: <br />-Chapter 9:Liquids and Solids<br />-Chapter 10:Properties of Solutions<br />-Chapter 13:Acids and Bases<br />-Chapter 14:Acid-Base Equilibria<br />-Chapter 15:Solubility and Complex Ion Equilibria<br /><br />DSE topics with newer concepts. The content is quite easy, I would say the calculations about the equilibria is the hardest part (harder than those in DSE).<br /><br />2) Topics include in the final exam:<br />-Chapter 16: Spontaneity, Entropy, and Free Energy<br />-Chapter 17: Electrochemistry<br />-Chapter 18:The Nucleus: A Chemist’s View <br />-Chapter 19:The Representative Elements <br />(wasn't taught and included in the final as there wasn't enough time to teach plus this topic is simple, Prof. Lin just encouraged us to read it at home)<br />-Chapter 20:Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry<br /><br />These chapters dig deeper into some DSE topics (except chapter 18, which is more or less included in DSE Physics), but generally they aren't very hard to understand and are interesting. As long as students understand the concepts, it would be fine to handle the final.<br /><br />The attendance is taken by randomly rolling 10 students in the middle break of each lecture. Prof. Lin refers this as 'the lucky draw' :)",

The 10 lucky students that appears on the screen will be asked to come down with student ID for attendance. If he/she didn't show up, 1% will be deducted from the total mark, max. 5 times.. So, evaluate your luck before skipping lessons.
