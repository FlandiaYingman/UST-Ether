        "description": "This course will start from the very beginning, with basic measure theory and functional analysis, and learn the advanced topic in infinite dimensional analysis about Gaussian measures on Banach spaces and Wiener measures on path spaces. We will discuss the following applications: (1) A rigorous introduction to Brownian motions and Ito calculus. (2) Heat equations and path integrals on Riemannian symmetric spaces. (3) Representation theory of loop groups. If time permits, we will also discuss some related research topics.",
