            "comment_content": "I don't usually write course reviews but I love this course so much that I am writing a really longggg review here ^^<br /><br />basically, you need to submit 5 assignments in the entire semester (so around 1 every 2-3 weeks), the first 4 will be a video around 1-2 minutes, and the last one will be a video around 2-3 minutes. <br /><br />You will be editing videos using films / dramas / games / anime / anything with audios (self-composed /songs /anything). Although there are topics for each assignment, you can pretty much do anything you want with any material you like as long as it's somewhat related to the topics. For each assignment, you also need to submit a director's commentary video where you show what effort you made<br /><br />I used Da Vinci Resolve, audacity and BandLab. But you can use anything you want<br /><br />According to the professor and TAs, the content and format of COMP 4441 and COMP1943 is almost identical",
            "comment_teaching": "don't expect any actual lectures on video/audio editing. TAs may do a few short tutorials on basic techniques but that's it. The professor will be playing videos edited by students in previous semesters or showing everyone's assignment and comment on what he/she did well in the assignment. Watching others' work is so much more effective to learn than having long lectures on techniques and theories in my point of view ^^<br /><br />really love how he is always supportive no matter how bad a video is lol the TAs are very fun as well",
            "comment_grading": "I had an A+, and I think the course is a good grade course since I had no video editing experience before at all<br /><br />50%- 4 assignments (all my regular assignment had marks very near the mean, one below mean and other three is slightly above mean)<br />40%- Final assignment (5.08/5, mean 4.2, highest 5.4)<br />10%- Peer evaluation (full mark for me)<br />10%- Listening test (bonus I think?)<br /><br />For the assignments, make sure to submit them to canvas and to the prof through email. You will get a base mark no matter what if you only submit to canvas, but people who sent the prof an email will have their video shown in class and will get bonus marks (the amount of bonus will depend on what mark the prof/ta/other students gave you, but you will get some no matter what). Almost everyone would send the professor emails, so please do so as well. No one will make fun of you :)<br /><br />The 10% peer evaluation is just surveys where you give marks to your peers' work. You will get the marks if you did them on time (and you didn't just give all full marks or zeros)<br /><br />The listening test is not actually a test, it's more like a survey, nothing will be tested. If you didn't just submit random answers so you can finish the test asap, I think you'll be fine<br /><br />tips: <br />(i) some reviews say audio editing is not important, I agree you can get high marks by just using a song in the background if your video is good. However, I'm sure people would be more impressed if you showed your effort to create original stuff, even if it doesn't sound professional<br /><br />(ii) although of course it's important to put effort in your regular assignments, make sure to make your final assignment a really good one, since it can affect your grade hugely<br /><br />(iii) you never know what the prof/ta/students like and will be impressed by, so SHOW ALL YOUR EFFORT ON THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY, EVEN IF THE EFFORT SEEMS NOT WORTH MENTIONING TO YOU <br />-&gt; in some sense, the director's commentary is a lot more important than your actual assignment <br />(especially if you did some impressive stuff, it's not surprising if some people didn't get what you did if you did not emphasize your effort in the commentary)<br /><br />(iv) don't worry if you are new to editing. you will pick up things quickly when you start your first assignment",
            "comment_workload": "it depends. for example,<br />(i) how much effort do you want to put in each video?<br />- you can do a lot of edits and create a lot of new things, or you can always do really quick editing, it's entirely up to you <br />-&gt; most of the time more effort = people being more impressed by your work and giving you higher marks, but if your ideas are smart, you can get a really high score (even higher than cases where people put a lot of effort but no one understands the effort)<br /><br />(ii) are you interested in video/audio editing?<br />- I find video/audio editing really fun so I did not consider the work as workload at all. I almost treated the assignments as leisure activity lmao<br />- but if you hate it, I don't see why you want to get in the course in the first place",

            "comment_content": "Basically you need to submit 5 videos (10 if you also count the director's commentary) throughout the semester (every 2-3 weeks). You can do it on your own, or work with another classmate. Also remember to do the peer review quiz each lesson.<br /><br />And here are the projects we had worked on this semester:<br />1. Magic Mashup Trailer (remake a trailer in another style)<br />2. Cyberpunk: Suspended In Time (include some slow-motion video and relevant sound effects)<br />3. Funk’n Fight Remix (Fight scene with funky music)<br />4. Breakup Remix (make a breakup MV for a pair of weird character combo)<br />5. Final Project- Pick 1 out of 2: a. Lip Reading Music Video; b. Sequel Mashup Trailer <br /><br />The first 4 regular homework &quot;requires&quot; you to make a video under 2 minutes, while the final one &quot;requires&quot; 2-3 minutes. But, as long as your video is good, exceeding the time limit is not a problem, my 4th assignment that is 2:30 long even got the highest score in class.<br /><br />Here's my advice before you read the rest, make sure you are somehow interested in video/audio editing before picking it, this will hugely impact how you feel about the workload and content of this course, because video editing can be quite time-consuming and complex. <br /><br />If you are inexperienced or less-experienced, but don't mind those difficulties and still want to try, you definitely have interest and should take this course, but also look out of experienced editors grabbing away your chances of getting As, their works can be close to professional. Plus, this course is not a video/audio editing course, you will have to figure out in your own.<br /><br />In my opinion, people with video-editing experience have a very great headstart, those with musical skills have also quite a nice headstart too.<br /><br />As you read along the reviews, you will realise the &quot;creative sound&quot; element seems to be quite minimal. In my opinion, yes and no. We need to express the creative sound design via video, that's why video-editing is important, and one of the important factors of video editing is sound design, so put more emphasis on this sector will help your video to be better.",
            "comment_teaching": "The prof played videos on each lesson, showing good works from previous semesters, and also reviewing everyone's video for peer review with short comments. In some classes, the TA will give a small tutorial on using some video/audio softwares, a helpful introduction for beginners.<br /><br />It's pretty much self-learning, and try your best to learn and be inspired from others; but if you have any questions, make sure to email.",
            "comment_grading": "50%- 4 Assignments<br />40%- Final Assignment<br />10%- Peer Evaluation<br />10%- Listening Test (Yea, I think this is actually a bonus 10%)<br /><br />For the assignments, always submit them on both canvas and email, this will give you a bit bonus score (because I think 99% of the class did that). The works that are sent to email will be showcased in class for peer evaluation.<br /><br />I suppose many of you would be curious what that listening test is all about, don't worry about that, as long as you attend and complete it, you will get full score, the test is more like a survey in my opinion. I will not tell what actually it tests, just not to ruin the surprise (or maybe the topic will be different from mine).<br /><br />Grading wise, as many people has commented is very LENIENT.<br />The mean for each assignment is around 4.3/5, not data on the SD, but the highest score is usually 4.9 to 5<br /><br />I am above mean in all assignments, with 1 highest in class, and my final assignment is 0.07 points away from the highest. Got A+",
            "comment_workload": "TL:DR- <br />1. You better have some interest in video/audio editing first<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Work with your heart, but work even more on the commentary<br /><br />Some basic info about me: I am a final year, and have editing experience for 5 years because of YouTube hobby, but I haven't edited any kind of music videos until this course, and it was sure fun and expanded my editing potential. I used Davinci Resolve as the video editing software, and used Audacity to help with some audio edits. Davinci Resolve is a godsend if you are into video editing and special effects, it's free, stable and equipped with so many features.<br /><br />1. This may sound condescending but 90% of students attending would be not very experienced, this had given me a huge advantage in terms of editing efficiency and quality. However, as the semester goes, some of their work have shown significant improvement, it was very exhilarating to me as an editing lover, and definitely pushed me to the limits.<br /><br />So how's the workload? I would say very little. Each video I spent around 3-5 days, a total of 40 hours to finish. Now some of you may say &quot;wow that's a lot&quot;, but this time of work is very typical for video editing, if you are going after perfection. Plus, I don't treat them as homeworks, I treat them as personal projects for fun. So ask yourself, how would you view them as? And do you have the time for that?<br /><br />2. If you have the interest and the time, have fun, be creative and work it with your heart. a trick I can give you is to work even better on the director's commentary, here's why- to let the viewer better understand your work and effort, and like your work even more. My commentaries on the last two assignments were more detailed and got nearly the highest score.",

Your submission (if you sent it to the professor) will be played in class for everyone to see (don't worry about it it's not scary). Then the professor will say something nice about your work, and move on to the next submission.<br /><br />Grading is subjective to the professor, the TAs, and partly from the class. There is a canvas quiz each class and each student can give a grade to each submission. Your grade for each submission is calculated by finding the weighted averages of these.<br /><br />The final project has a higher grade weighting than the other assignments but the topic is more vague so you can do almost anything you want. <br /><br />I spent time to make good submissions so I got A+. I had a friend take it and spent around 2-3 hours per submission (so like 15 hours of actual work in the whole semester) and got a B.",
            "comment_workload": "The time you spend on it depends on how much you want to mix or compose music, and how many effects and cuts or sound effects you want to add. <br /><br />Usually if you add more stuff to your submission you'll get a higher grade. But if you're able to produce a good submission without much effort then good for you. You could spend 1-2 hours every 2 weeks, or work for hours every single day if that's how you want to spend your time. The longest I've spent is probably around 23 hours on one submission for what I consider a masterpiece (it got really high marks).",

You got 5/5 for every assignment you hand in on time so it depends on those BONUSES. <br /><br />BUT FIRST, people who have already finished their &quot;COMP4441 computer music&quot; course will definitely have advantages over the one who didnt, cuz the themes are set based on those in COMP4441. <br /><br />Since I didnt take any comp course in the past AND I stop going to the tutorial after the 3rd/4th week, my works are obviously less appealing comparing to those who got experience in this field. Also, I did my work alone so this may affect<br /><br />I got B range with about 0.5 to 2 bonus points for each assignments.
