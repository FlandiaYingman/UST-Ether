        "description": "The course organizes a student’s previously acquired English language skills into a useful managerial toolkit targeted toward specific business applications and strategies. Students learn how to adapt and apply their English language abilities to real-world assignments within their business major and, after graduation, to career tasks and opportunities. Positioned toward the latter portion of a student’s undergraduate business education, the course prepares students to succeed in their remaining university assignments (such as research tools, written tests, presentations, interviews, meetings, collaborative assignments, interpersonal communication and so forth) as well as the communication challenges they can expect in their careers. For Business students in their third or fourth year of study under the 4-year curriculum.",
