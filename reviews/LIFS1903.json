            "comment_teaching": "No offense to Professor Hung, but his talking after 30-40 minutes can get extremely boring. While he does explain the labs clearly and slowly step-by-step, I can tell a lot of people after the 40 minute mark start to lose attention, and by 1 hour half the class has fallen asleep. A lot of things he states in both the lab explanation and the tutorial will be useful in both writing the lab reports and completing the quizzes, so try your best to pay attention. <br /><br />Groups of 2 students are assigned to 1 TA each. My TA (not going to state any names) was very attentive of what we did while giving us clear instructions and advice.",
            "comment_grading": "Graded P/F, so it's pretty hard to &quot;fail&quot; this course if you really commit to working hard. <br /><br />Apparently because a lot of people in my class didn't do very well writing lab reports or answering quiz questions, the policy of passing/failing certain assignments was changed this year:<br /><br />Basically, a pass is 5 or above out of 10, and a fail is below 5<br /><br />There is a certain level of tolerance to individual assessments; which there are 11: 5 quizzes, 5 lab reports, and the skills test. <br />You are allowed to fail a maximum of 1 assignment(number of failed assignments is 0 or 1). If you fail around 2-4 assignments, the instructors will allow you to take a remedial exam once all your other exams have been finished; this remedial exam is comprised of all the lab content taught in this course. If you pass the remedial exam, regardless of how many assignments you failed(apart from the skills test), you pass the course. <br /><br />If you fail the skills test, you fail the course regardless; no redo's. The skills test is pretty easy though (mostly pipetting skills and microscopy analysis) so no issue there. <br /><br />My score: P (obviously)",
            "comment_workload": "You have to write a lab report every time there is a lab, and that lab is usually due only a couple days after the lab was held(meaning you have to complete the lab report as soon as possible regardless of whatever you have due in those next few days). This is because Hung will use students lab reports as the basis for the next week's tutorial and quiz(also a quiz every two weeks, which covers all content taught in the lab). <br /><br />You don't have to memorize everything in the labs for the lab quizzes; the quizzes are all open book and generally last the entire period of class from the end of the tutorial(which on average is 2-2.5 hours). So you'll have ample time to search, read, answer, and check your responses.",
