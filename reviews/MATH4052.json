            "comment_content": "NOTE: This version is different from the ordinary one (the one taught by Professor WANG) and is only for reference<br /><br />As the professor used to teach the PDE course for PG student, the reference book used is for PG student and the contents taught is also different from usual one. The syllabus is as the following (listed in the sequence of teaching):<br /><br />1. Distribution Theory (*)<br />2. Characteristics method<br />3. Maximum Principle for Heat and Laplace Equation<br />4. Fourier transform<br />5. Schwartz distribution (Tempered Distribution) (*)<br />6. PDE with boundaries<br />7. Duhamel's Principle (*)<br />8. Seperation of variables<br /><br />in which I believe the ones with asterisk are not taught in the ordinary version. Besides, the Professor assumed the students are familiar with real analysis (at least for some terminology like &quot;compact&quot;), complex analysis (for computing contour integral for Fourier transform) and some special notations (like index) used in the reference book. You should at least know a little bit about the contents above before enrolling into this course. This course also put emphasis on both computation and proof, so you should at least be familiar with writing proofs. Despite of the above prerequisites, this course provides more intuition behind the principle of solving different PDE and it develops different tools more rigorously, so I recommend student who want to study PDE in a more rigorous approach and learn more different methods in solving PDE to take this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "As for this semester, it is a small class (only 16 people enrolled), Professor Gunther takes a relatively relaxed pace to teach. He is also passionate in helping student to understand the contents. However his approach is rather disorganised and sometimes it is difficult to understand his motivation in proving some lemmas/theorems. It is also a little bit difficult to recognise his handwriting and no lecture notes are provided. So it relies a lot on the student's own effort to understand the contents. The TA mostly teaches how to solve the assignment problems so it is worth to go.",
            "comment_grading": "The professor promised a decent grading during class so the grading is not bad. Homework takes up 40% of the total score while final takes up 60%. The statistics are as the following (the mark in bracket is my own score):<br />Homework 1: Mean: 38.8/50 (50)<br />Homework 2: Mean: 32/40 (40)<br />Homework 3: Mean: 39.93/50 (50)<br />Homework 4: Mean: 39.6/50 (49)<br />Homework 5: Mean: 39.93/50 (50)<br />Final: Mean: 53.93/100 (70)<br />Total: Mean: 64.08/100 (81.84)<br />and I got an A-. The TA also promised to give a decent score if you tried hard in homework so those marks are relatively easy to get.",
            "comment_workload": "As mentioned in &quot;Teaching&quot; section, you have to pay a lot of effort to get familiar with the new contents, especially the professor first taught distribution theory which involves some knowledge of real analysis and topology and is completely new to all of us who attended the class. The assignments are also tough despite of the decent score guaranteed by the TA. We are given two weeks to solve the assignment and on average it takes me 6 hours to solve. Some which requires writing very long proofs even took me a few day as I am not familiar in writing proofs, therefore I strongly advice those who are not familiar in writing proofs not to enrol in this course.",

Assuming they had a relatively good performance on the HW, they should've gotten A range too. 3 students got 100% on the final so they're probably A+ students. (Our class size was 41). Despite what the other course reviews say, Prof. XIANG turned out to be an ok grader, at least for this particular course. Also, if anyone is deterred by the high scores you need for A range (mid-to-high 80s), then you should note that the exam questions are fairly standard and it isn't that difficult to get a decent score.

If he adopt a more advanced PDE book like Evans' PDE book, my life will be ruined. <br /><br />Standard linear PDE content anyway - Heat equation, wave equation, Laplace equation. <br /><br />Various methods for solving them are discussed (depending on domain of the PDE defined), like deducing solution formula, method of separation of variable, Green's function method and so on. Fourier series is also discussed, one purpose is to retrieve the coefficients from the series solution (from separate variable) of, say, Laplace equation on disk domain. Needless to say, the good properties like maximum principle, uniqueness of solution and so on are also included. <br />(Try to compare holomorphic functions and harmonic functions, they enjoy similar properties. Think about, why?)<br /><br />Lastly the professor covered some introductory content of distribution theory and Fourier transform. I personally think learning these important (and beautiful) topics from this book is a joke. Why not learn them from more proper real analysis and functional analysis textbook?<br /><br />I give this area C because I respect the knowledge covered in the syllabus.",

These are elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations with solutions via Fourier Transform, separation of variables, etc. You will also cover basic boundary/initial value problems as well as proving uniqueness and existence of solutions. Instead of teaching you how to solve a specific problem, he teaches you a very generalised approach to solving PDEs. This means the class isn't your ordinary mathematics class in HKUST. Unfortunately, this approach is also quite theoretical. We didn't actually see or solve a single PDE until halfway through the semester! Just so you get the flavour, we followed Andras Vasy's book mainly. This is a more advanced book that focused on 'distributions' because they yield derivatives of discontinuous functions. A cool generalised approach!",
            "comment_teaching": "Gunther was a good instructor because he has an extraordinary background. He has been teaching for many decades and it shows. However, he only writes on the board by hand and his handwriting is terrible. He is also a pretty research-oriented person, so he can't really tell you how to solve a specific problem. I enjoyed taking his class a lot because of his teaching style.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading was just fine. You have some homeworks every 2 weeks and a final exam. No midterm. The TA is told to grade leniently because our questions were very very very theoretical. He told us the answers in the tutorial before the homework deadline, so you should get full marks for the homework. The exam is set by the TA and was based on the homeworks. Only a small upper division class, so the grading was reasonable.",
