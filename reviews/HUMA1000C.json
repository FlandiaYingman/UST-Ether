        "description": "This course has defined “historical narrative as a perception” as the specific approach of humanities perspective to form the contents of the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs). By applying this historiographical approach, the course will base on the following four propositions: a) historical narratives matter in our perception (shaping how we understand our world and perceive what is going on in our surroundings); b) historical narratives vary; c) Historical narratives may create bias; and d) historical narratives may generate positive mindset. Within this framework, three basic values will be explored: Economic development, legal justice, and social diversity. The first value explores the mindset of market efficiency and marketism in the pursuit of self-interest and material well-being of society as well as related controversy. The second value examines the competing perceptions of justice in law and beliefs. The third value relates to the complexity in racial, gender, and cultural diversity in various historical contexts. Lectures will discuss various ideas and theories in relation to these values and provide historical examples to help students reflect on these values.",

Final essay (1000 words)，3題essay prompts揀1，throughout成個sem會有唔同嘅deadlines要我哋一段段咁交俾workshop instructor，叫做攤分咗workload，唔駛sem尾一次過chur篇文出嚟。每次instructor都會俾feedback，要跟住改，都學到嘢嘅。",
