The textbook has tons of questions and a short hint is available for each question(only very few questions have full solutions, I guess it's because this is a new book). Sometimes hint is helpful while other times you can get nothing from it, so I just finish a portion of those questions. I think the difficulty of exams is not as much as the difficulty of the hard questions in the book.",

From an objective perspective, it is not difficult to get B or above. <br /><br />When grading homework, the TA selectively grades easiest questions. I recall in an instance, we had ten questions, two of them extremely challenging. I spent a lot of time to eventually figure it out. However, the TA turns out just ignore those two questions, and only mark the easiest three problems (you can finish these 3 questions with just 6 lines). The same happens for every other assignments. Although I cannot assert whether the choice of question is intentional or a coincidence, the marking behavior severely curtail advantages of above-average students.<br /><br />Finally, the ultimate debacle is the grade Prof. Xiong gives out. He ridiculously graded by curve on a class size of just 40, and the apocalyptic consequence is that there is not a single A+. With numerous people obtaining overall marks around 98-99, the highest grade is merely only A. His transcendental way of grading amuses good and bad students alike.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is moderate, largely consists of weekly or bi-weekly assignments. Each assignment consists of around ten questions, both easy and challenging. The TA will only grade certain problems (of course you don't know which will he mark before hand). <br /><br />For midterm and final exams, the content is very straightforward and standard, time is sufficient, no trick question involved. However, you should always do as much exercises as possible.",
