            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Hu deserves an A grade here because his lectures were a good balance of conceptual and application-related things, and he presented the contents very clearly. He's also infinitely patient with our queries, even the lazy/ brainless ones like &quot;can you explain this slide again&quot;.<br /><br />This course has tutorials which are NOT COMPULSORY and UNRELATED TO THE ASSESSMENTS, but I went there nonetheless because the teaching materials as uploaded seemed to be helpful for the assignments.<br /><br />Unfortunately the tutor (for us it was Rong NIE) was barely able to speak in English, or loudly enough for the first two rows in LSK G021 to hear her, and then she wasn't teaching the relevant stuff most of the time. For example, she used 3 tutorial sessions, all of them over 1hr 20 minutes because somehow she wasn't aware that the tutorials are supposed to only last 50 minutes, to teach sequential SS... which nobody ever needed in the lectures, assignments and exams. Google it if you're interested, I'm not explaining it here.<br /><br />This is also why I gave a B rating overall because I have a suspicion that next semester they'll have a different tutor... I mean, I wasn't the only one writing a huge rant about her in the SFQ...",
            "comment_grading": "7 assignments - 15%<br />1st exam - 40%<br />2nd exam - 45%<br /><br />Some of the assignments are in groups, and others are individual-based. As for the exams, they're both in class, and you're allowed to bring in an A4-sized, two-sided cheatsheet which Prof. Hu suggests that you do not directly copy the lecture slides. The recommendation makes sense because otherwise you're either copying too many words, or too many unrelated graphs.<br /><br />A funky grade policy: if your final exam score sees a great improvement from the midterm's result, you can apply for shifting the entire weight of midterm to final (i.e. midterm weight --&gt; 0%, final --&gt; 85%!). This policy cannot be applied in the opposite direction - I asked Prof. Hu, and he said no, but he said he'll consider the fact that I participated in class :P so yea. <br /><br />I got 23/24 in the midterm, and 19/24 in the final (which is why I asked if the grade policy can be applied vice versa haha). And then I got around 18-20/ 20 in all the assignments. Eventually I got an A... I think the grading is pretty decent. (and I think he has already considered my participation in class even if it's not actually graded haha)<br /><br />Side note 1: not sure about the future semesters, but the exams are a lot more conceptual than the lecture, and the assignments are a lot more hands-on than the lecture... so that counts as two sides of the same knowledge you'll get. It's great to be able to understand and then apply the concepts, but not so nice if you're only strong at one facet but not the other.<br /><br />Side note 2: remember to do the sample exams he puts onto canvas! It's significantly similar to the actual thing. (You can use the samples however you want, but I used the samples as diagnostics before I start revising for the exams, and I got around 16/23 for both samples.)",
            "comment_workload": "Your workload is highly dependent on the quality of groupmates you choose, and how much you know Minitab. <br /><br />With that said, the &quot;Stat&quot; tab will be very useful because it contains most of the things you'll need for doing the assignments. Also if you can't get the real software on your laptop, you can try using virtual barn, but the best is to do it in the actual barn because virtual barn freezes all the time if you use excel + Minitab at the same time.<br /><br />Good luck finding your groupmates, and look for people who usually go to class and can read English properly... or be prepared to do the same homework 3 or 4 times to demonstrate how much bullshit they've got in their heads.",

Sometimes a new symbol pops up out of nowhere. This makes understanding and revision immensely hard. I understand the equations may have come from different textbooks but it would be a much nicer gesture to try to modify the equation to avoid such confusion.<br /><br />It is also weird that he sometimes chooses to explain simple algebra, like moving terms from the left to right sides in an equation, rather than using the complex equations and what each term represents in those equations.<br /><br />You can go to the lab where the TA teaches the software.",
