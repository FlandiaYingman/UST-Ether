I usually use review the lectures in 2x speed which is normal to me lol<br />His own examples are used to illustrate the marketing concepts. He also used pretty much time to explain the cases while we can read them by ourselves.<br />Before final, he gave us a sample calculation question to familiarize ourselves with the test. He actually simply copied a question from an Accounting textbook WITHOUT realizing the calculation method is DIFFERENT from we have learned in class. My friends and I were very confused so we asked the TA for the solution, but the TA refused to give us lol. Not until I sent email to Gene did we realize the fact (You can tell how much time they have devoted for teaching this course...)",

Nothing tricky.<br /><br />Cases Analyses: Quite a number of cases to be done (5 in total), questions like drafting a marketing plan and discussing the pros and cons of the company's approach. Some calculations are also needed in your reports.<br /><br />PharmaSim: Try not to finish all 7 rounds at once. Your group discussion can be time-consuming so I suggest you start early and don't be deadline fighters. A report about your learning from PharmaSim should be submitted at the end of the semester (My group ranked quite high at last, we included a lot of marketing concepts that we applied to make us succeed in our report, but Gene gave us a low mark because we were not discussing any mistakes learnt from the game.... I was really confused about what he wants from the report..... like we didn't make any major mistake so that we ranked high right?!)<br /><br />Final Exam: Gene originally planned to make a close-book exam heavily focused on calculation and essay questions, but then he changed to an all-MC final and allowed us to bring 1 double-sided cheat sheet (I'm immediately relieved). Questions are mainly about definitions and calculations. Just put everything in the lecture slides into my cheat sheet.<br /><br />Class Participation: No comments for that.

I think we were 8th or 7th group out of 10 lol but you can make it up by writing good reports. <br />Given one of the freeriders also got not a bad grade, I guess both pharmasim and peer evaluation don't contribute as much to the final grade. <br />The final was pretty difficult - mostly quantitative, with not enough time. I managed to get 1sd at the end but it was not easy. <br />I ended up with an A - what a miracle. I have to think it was in-class participation that saved me.",

            "comment_content": "This is the final marketing course for every MARK student to take. It is mainly about taking marketing strategies after considering various factors such as 4Ps,STPs etc. You are expected to apply the concepts learnt in the previous MARK classes to this one. <br /><br />For a MARK course, this is the most quantitative in nature as it will involve applying formulas and calculations. It's a bit challenging to adjust to this as most people are used to MARK being more theoretical in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There will be a bunch of cases to read throughout the semester, some boring as fuck, some kinda interesting. Exam questions are similar to the case questions although the assigned cases would not be tested. <br /><br />The main project work is playing a simulation game called PharmaSim where the main objective is to achieve the maximum possible stock price for a cold medicine which is the main product for a company. The game can be quite confusing and make no sense at times, so better to get started as soon AS THE TRIAL PERIOD BEGINS. Because after the trial period, any decision you will take will actually contribute to your final score for PharmaSim. The game will be time consuming as you'll need to analyze multiple variables such as price, salesforce, advertising, promotion, special decision etc. and make decisions for each one of them. There will be 2 rounds of PharmaSim in the semester, the best of either round will be taken as the final score. You will be competing with other groups in the class, so pay attention to the comparative results as you play along. Some people nailed this game, some people fucked it up (like my group lol) so you need to play carefully. It is worth taking the professor's advice, ask seniors about the game, use older sources for reference. But there is definitely a luck factor involved in this game, so you can only hope for the best and be able to justify your decisions.",

But some days I'd have to admit he is quite boring. Especially the days he explains the cases, you'd fall asleep. He speaks quite slowly, prob his age, which makes it hard to concentrate at times. <br /><br />But when it came to the quantitative stuff, I feel he could have done a better job. He did explain the calculations but could have explained better in terms of the logic and where he pulled the numbers from. From what I have heard, the other prof Jiewen Hong explained the quant. stuff quite well so it's worth sitting in both classes and see who is more suitable for you.",

Some people legit played all 7 rounds for one day which I don't recommend at all. But it is manageable and not too heavy. Apart from that not much. <br /><br />They expect cases to be read beforehand, but a majority barely read it or didn't even bother to find out about the case. So Gene would just explain it anyways knowing the fact that most wouldn't care to read it. You will need to submit the answers for the case discussed in class a day or 2 day later. This is a group submission so any one person can do it. I guess this is just participation, and they wouldn't bother to check if the answers are actually right or wrong. <br /><br />There is a PharmaSim report to do at the end of the semester which would be due sometime in the study break, so try to finish it beforehand. Follow the guidelines strictly and what he mentions in class i.e properly justify your decisions and give an example of a quantitative analysis you did to show proof.",
