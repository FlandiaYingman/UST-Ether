Teaches fairly basic and common approaches to business challenges, imagine ted talk but live, and with a PowerPoint and occasional jokes.",

Majority of people in my year are extremely dissatisfied with what they got in the end, and some appealed but that won't work, unless he likes you. If english is your native tounge, he's going to like you, unless you try to act smart and have too many things to say. Just put his comments or suggestions into your actual deliverables and you'll be fine. Try not to go for too innovative ideas, go for stable but well elaborated. Include all the details you can and finally, be confident and don't be scared to speak up.",

Enjoy before you need to take the actual GBUS courses, this is only a taste of what they will be, and how capable those courses are in occupying your entire week.",
