        "description": "This course is intended as an introduction to contemporary Hong Kong. We will consider the city as a laboratory of social change: economic, political, social and cultural developments all have visible manifestations in the built environment and lived experience of the city. Hong Kong, as linked both to China and the world more generally, is a particularly good window on the complexities and contradictions of our current global moment. The course will take place both in the classroom and outside. We will draw on academic readings as well as ongoing public debates in the popular media. There will also be discussions with guest speakers who are experts in various aspects of contemporary Hong Kong life. More importantly, the city itself will be our classroom. Students will work in small groups to make regular field visits to particular sites in the city. Ethnographic work will culminate in group projects that will take the form of an analytical photographic essay.",
