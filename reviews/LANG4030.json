            "comment_content": "1. Interim Report (25%) - supposed to help your fyp. However, it covers introduction and literature review after your actual FYP proposal was due. So how can it help? Well, if it is supposed to help the Progress Report, then how may I write the details just one month after fall semester kicks off??? Stupid and ridiculous af.<br /><br />Yet, this is not the most trashy stuff.<br />2. Poster Present (25%) - supposed to prepare us for the presentation in late April. However, CSE has changed the present style to video since Covid, no more poster. Nvm, still fine, the most weird point is how may I make up the stuff that I haven’t worked yet to present?<br /><br />Anyway, this is still not the worst part.<br />3. Mobile App Review (20%)<br />4. User Guide (20%)<br />Well, what’s the point for adding these two in a FYP Lang course?<br />Apart from filling up the contents for full 13 weeks, I can’t see any. App review is stupid, you need to make a picture-in-picture video, and I don’t really see there is a relationship with CSE. User guide is probably the most nonsense stuff, teaching audiences to use a website which is in turn helping CLE to promote their rubbish websites.<br /><br />Assignment Checkpoints (10%) - used to replace attendance. But imo its even worse than having attendance score. At least attendance can save some lives.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is so bad. Rosita is not the worst tutor and she speaks clearly with energy and she is okish engaging.<br /><br />However, the overall teaching for this course is a complete disaster. The tasks lack coherence in between. Unclear guidelines and rubrics. Not following the CSE department standard. Even worse, there was not enough time to cover User Guide in my class due to typhoon (but the typhoon hit one month ago). And the tutor just rushed everything towards the end, while occasionally she ends the class half hour in advance, showing she lacks time management skills.<br /><br />There was also no clear instructions on what being expected on assignment checkpoints and the schedules have flaws. Idk why, but our class skipped assignment checkpoint 3 without any prior notice. Nonsense.",
            "comment_grading": "Super poor grading.<br /><br />First of all, fyr I am a ddp student. I took 6 Lang + Labu courses in total. I got A- in every single lang course even including chinese lang.<br /><br />Anyway, I got a B in Lang4030, only here but not in others. I got A- in Lang1003, A- in Lang2030, A- in Labu2040, A- in Labu2060, A- in Lang1117P.<br /><br />Therefore, I doubt whether it is my problem or the problems of this tutor and CLE that my grade dropped drastically from a consistent A- to B.<br /><br />Indeed, almost in all of my assignments, I got “good” band in the rubrics.<br /><br />Interim Report: 5 / 5.5 / 5.5 / 5.5<br />Poster Present: 5 / 5.5 / 5.5<br />Mobile App Review: 5 / 5 / 5<br />User Guide: 5 / 5 / 5.5 / 5<br /><br />Yes, a whole bunch of 5 and 5.5<br />Moreover, the released comments do not really match with my work. I wonder if my tutor has graded them seriously or just randomly give out some 5 and some 5.5 then next.<br /><br />I attended all classes although attendance was not taken. I am not sure about my assignment checkpoints score as it is quite messy on Canvas but I guess it should be full. <br /><br />Final letter grade: B<br /><br />Super bad.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is huge af, and most importantly, none of then is useful.<br /><br />For your reference, the interim report is due AFTER the actual fyp proposal, so you cant use it to help. Moreover, you have to make a poster out from nowhere (poster is supposed for an end-of-project presentation but given it is in Fall term you can only “make up” your work)<br /><br />Interim report and poster present are both due in week 7, during the week where most of the other midterms are held. And I have to spent my precious time working on these nonsense stuff amid being busy in the midterm week, in return for poor gradings.<br /><br />Then, a useless app review where you need to make a video-in-video presentation that I spent hours making the technical stuff even I have finished filming early. My macbook literally dies when I was making it. <br /><br />The user guide is a bit lighter, but anyway, these two garbage tasks are due in week 13, where your other final projects / exams are due. You will have to suffer a lot with this course.<br /><br />However, you have to take it. Therefore, when my tutor and/or SFQ asked me how may this course improve, apologies, there is nothing to improve, please just shut this course down and don’t ever waste final year students’ precious time again. There is no fucking use in the entire course. If one doesn’t know how to write FYP report, this course can’t help due to its loose structure and not following the CSE requirements tightly; If one already knows how to write FYP report, this course for sure won’t help.<br /><br />Everyone knows how to search for “how to write a report” on Google.

            "comment_content": "Two topics with four components in total:<br /><br />Topic 1 : FYP<br />1.1. Interim report<br />1.2. Poster presentation<br /><br />Topic 2 : Workplace communication<br />2.1. App review<br />2.2. User guide<br /><br />Mostly useless. The only useful component probably is the FYP interim report. At least it vaguely gives you some idea on your real FYP progress report. However, the requirements, standards , structure and style are not totally the same. You need to write a &quot;LANG style&quot; interim report. That is, merely focusing on language requirement (fancy words, sentence structure) rather than the integrity of your ideas. Therefore, it can only gives you a vague taste of the real FYP report.<br /><br />At the time you start writing the interim report, you should have submitted your proposal report. As a result, very likely you only need to modify, paraphrase and shorten your proposal report and then done. For my group we write over 9000 words in the proposal report and we need to shorten it to around 1500 words, which is painful<br /><br />For other components I just cannot figure out their reason for existence = =<br /><br />Since this is my last LANG course, maybe let me talk a little bit more. I just hate CLE ruining the objective of each assessment with their trash rubrics. When students are doing an assessment task, they only need to treat the rubrics as a kind of checklist or shopping list. Then, put all the things CLE want into their submission, boxing it with some fancy words or sentence structures. Lastly, submit it and pray for the instructor is not a killer. Is this mechanical assessment style effective to let student learn language? I am doubted about that. At least I learn nearly nothing throughout every LANG course I enrolled in UST. Then CLE why do you force us to enroll these meaningless course? Just for torturing us?",
            "comment_teaching": "Angie's teaching is fine, not superior though. I can see that she has the heart to teach. In the lecture she tries not to reading from the textbook merely. She keeps reminding us the key points or traps of the assessment tasks. She is also willing to answer our questions or give advice on assessment tasks after class. These are good.<br /><br />However, she likes to see us talking. Every lecture she divides us into teams and holds many discussion sessions (Nearly half of the lecture will be discussion time). Well, as you know IT people are likely introverts. As a result, people are not very willing to talk, talk random irrelevant things, or even just let dead air occurs, which is a little bit embarrassing. I know she wants us to talk more because it is essential in language learning. However, being one of the introverts, I still don't like this teaching style very much personally...<br /><br />Another problem is that she gives feedback and score so slowly. It takes a long time to receive my Topic 1 assessment feedback and results. At the time this comment comes out, I still haven't received my result on Topic 2 assessments. Very probably she just wants to skip them and gives me the letter grade directly...<br /><br />When we ask for feedback, she always claims that she is busy. Come on Angie, is there a person in UST not busy?<br /><br />(Update 5/2/2023)<br />Well I know my grade now. However, Angie didn't release the score of assessment 2 from beginning to the end. Likely one month ago I sent her an email to request the score. However, she didn't reply. I think that is a little bit irresponsible...",

However, it is up to you to judge whether it is good, fair or bad grade.<br /><br />Grade distribution and my score:<br />Topic 1 : FYP<br />1.1. Interim report (25%) : 5.5 6 6 6<br />1.2.

But it may be a problem for final year CSE students who has FYP and bunch of difficult course to deal with.<br /><br />If you are doing FYP, you are going to do the interim report together. Each person will only need to write around 300-400 words. For poster presentation, you can design the poster together (Presentation part is still individual though). On the other hand, it may takes longer time in app review because you also need to do video editing, which is troublesome. However, overall I think it is still barely acceptable.<br /><br />Also, there are 4 assessment tasks checkpoint which helps you to brainstorm or check whether you are on the right track. They are mainly held during the lecture and can be finished in a short time. Therefore, just don't escape class then you will be fine.",

The user review is 700-1000 words, but since you are just mostly describing actions, it's also pretty easy.<br /><br />For the app review video, recording will take some time as you should aim for no mistakes in one take, editing the video will also take a while.",

Over one semester, students will attend three hours of class and will be expected to complete up to six hours of out-of-class work, per week. The course focuses on two areas: Communication skills for CSE projects and Communication in Professional Contexts",

There are sufficient requirements and guidelines for the textbook. The Interim report and poster FYP overlap with FYP, so they reduced a lot of time.<br /><br />Take care of assignment checkpoints, there are 4 checkpoints before each assignment. Students wrote a part of the assignment and receive feedback from the instructor. Good luck and take it easy :))",
