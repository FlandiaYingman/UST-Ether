        "description": "This course addresses two fundamental questions about energy policy: Why and how do governments intervene in energy markets? What do we know about the relationships between government decisions and the economic and environmental performance of energy systems? The class begins with an overview of energy-related challenges confronted by policymakers: climate change, energy poverty, the competition for natural resources, and barriers to sustainable energy use and innovation needs. Policy types are introduced through the lens of energy technologies and their historial/ ongoing development. We examine the role of data, models, and uncertainties in policy decisions. The primary focus of the course is international.",
