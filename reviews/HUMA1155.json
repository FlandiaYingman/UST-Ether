Filming<br />- equipment<br />- different angles and distances of shots <br />3. ... (I dont quite rmb and the ppt is not all there)<br /><br />Ppt is brief and that will not help u much on making ur video, just really get to know about video art.",
            "comment_teaching": "1 lesson per week, 2 hrs 50 mins <br /><br />The content he taught definitely do not worth 3 hrs but he take attendance so u must go <br /><br />Being late or leaving early for more than 10 minutes twice will be counted as one absence so u can't even be late <br /><br />There is a course schedule in the syllabus but then for the first few lesson he keeps changing it without telling us. We only know the schedule was changed when we arrive there. <br />The schedule is important because there are some lessons like practical workshops that require u to bring ur camera and tripod.<br /><br />He loves to talk about something that i think not quite related and he loves to talk about himself. I would not say that is bad as that's how I make through that 3 hrs. Just see if u can accept that.<br /><br />There are non-local students who really don't understand Cantonese. Prof said he will be teaching in English and tell those students don't be worry. However I am going to say his English is not quite good and he always use Hong Kong movie and directors as examples, I don't think those non-local students would understand. Also, he automatically change to Cantonese when he is excited in talking about something he familiar or love, that's quite unfriendly to non-local students.",
            "comment_grading": "10% Attendance <br />30% Midterm Project (Individual) <br />40% Final Project (Group project) <br />20% Learning Portfolio<br /><br />None of the score was disclosed. All u need to do is guess ur performance by his comment when u present.<br /><br />I attended all lessons and 1 was late. I think I did ok in midterm and learning portfolio but did a terrible job in final. At last I got a C+.<br />My friend in class did a little worse in midterm and better in learning portfolio, in the same group with me in final but she got B-. <br /><br />There are youtubers and bloggers in the class who made really great videos and got praised by the whole class. Prof shown complete bias on them in class so I can't say this course is friendly to newbies.",
            "comment_workload": "Super super super heavy workload (in my point of view)<br /><br />First, this is not a video editing course. This course is about producing a video by urself. <br />A complete process of making a video should be<br />1. expending ur idea (mind map)<br />2. imagine the shots u want to take and arrange them (storyboard)<br />3. go take ur shots<br />4. edit ur shots <br />All of these things are required plus a written statement in this course. (once for midterm and once for final)<br /><br />Details for midterm:<br />1 min video to present urself<br />600 words written statement <br />A mind map<br />A storyboard<br />5 mins presentation (actually is must longer as he will ask you questions afterwards)<br />deadline was quite near my midterms<br /><br />he did said he will teach us to do the mind map and storyboard in the course schedule so u will want to wait till he show u the samples in lessons. It is quite late if u start to do ur video when him finish teaching all the related content as that is the midterm period.<br /><br />Details for final (gp project with 3-4 students a gp): <br />3-5 min video to show the best side of Hong Kong<br />1000 words written statement <br />research works<br />A storyboard<br />5 mins presentation <br />Deadline was right before sem end<br /><br />DO MAKE FRIENDS IN CLASS! u don't want to wait till he make a gp for u. <br />This is a huge project, if u want to do great, start early.<br /><br />Details for learning portfolio:<br />not quite clear<br />&quot;observations, inspirations, and ideas on the assignments (eg, brainstorming / free drawings/ draft) and research that came across during the semester&quot; this is what was written in the syllabus.<br />he suggest making at least 2 pages per week and he want pictures for illustration too, so u better push urself to done that each week as the deadline for this is only a week before the final project. Don't think u will have enough time to do that by one week as u still have other courses. <br /><br /><br />I am quite sure this course bring hard time for many ppl in the course:<br />somebody did late drop before midterm project<br />somebody were credit overloading to do this course (21/24 credits)<br />some newbies need to learn all things about making a video in about a month<br /><br />So guys better assess urself before enrolling in this course, u need a very good time management skill.",
