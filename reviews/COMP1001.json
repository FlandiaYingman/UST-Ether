You have to use your own knowledge to write an app and shoot a video with your group mates. For me, I have 0 knowledge in writing app! So I have to watch some videos to learn, and ask professor Leung &amp; TA to give me some help. Otherwise, it is difficult to finish the app in time.

You have to do the quiz and lab every week (for this semester, the lab section is at 6-8pm --&gt; sleepy). You have to write the app eventually. You have to study some technical skills before the exam study break because the exam is not in the exam period. Many small pieces will result a big stuff if you cannot withstand the workload.

The lectures just teach you very simple however unhelpful knowledge about MIT App inventor so you need to spend much time self-studying about how to use more functions in MIT when you are really trying to develop the App project. <br /><br />The GIMP is also something SUCKED that seems easy to use but hard to be pro on that. (In Chinese: 易學難精) The lectures just teach you how to use basic function like adjusting brightness or add filter to photos, but the exam needs you to do complicated stuff like background removing and layers editing. If you don't have much time or passion for practice on software using, better not chose this course.",

There's a practical part in the final exam where you may need to use GIMP to complete a task. I am more familiar with Photoshop and prof allows us to use Photoshop during exam. So it isn't that bad when there's an alternative.<br />If you study DSE ICT, this course is no big deal to you. The contents would be easy for you coz it's less in-depth than DSE's syllabus.",

Each question cover each practical software mentioned above.<br /><br />In the multiple choices part, there are like 40 questions which you can all find the answers in all the lecture PowerPoint. Since it's an open notes exam it's pretty easy to get high score if you are careful. You have to download all the PowerPoint before the exam as they will lock all access to them on canvas.

Basically there are one lab every week or so (sometimes you don't have it). You could join the lab session and ask for help from TA. You could stay in there for 1-2 hours and finish it and submit it immediately so you don't need to worry about forgetting week for the rest of the week. They are pretty easy, and are all about those practical software I have mentioned (Word, PowerPoint, Excel and GIMP.). Be sure to meet all the requirements mentioned in the Lab PowerPoint and ask for clarification if you are not sure. You don't want to miss too many score with the lab.",

            "comment_content": "A beginner course on basic computer skills and concepts. The labs focus on practical skills that can be quite useful in daily life, like Google Drive, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, AppInventor and GIMP (photo editing). The lectures cover topics such as simple game/app programming, internet security concepts,&nbsp;&nbsp;computer software and hardware, computer graphics and HTML. My most memorable lecture was the one on search engines. Since it is Professor Leung's research interest, he was able to provide great insight into the topic.<br /><br />Content is mainly factual and not hard to understand. It should be very easy to pick up if you have any background in ICT or technology. I personally think the syllabus is very close to the ICT DSE one, so if you took ICT before it should be pretty easy to handle. Might not learn much new content though.<br /><br />There's also a group project that requires you to make a mobile app and film a video for it. It's not difficult, but can be time consuming.<br /><br />Generally a simple and fun course.",
            "comment_teaching": "This course adopts sort of a flip classroom mode, you have to watch pre-recorded lecture videos at home before the lectures and complete very simple online quizzes (5 questions). During the actual lecture, the professor rarely teaches and uses most of the time for lecture activities. Attendance is counted and the activities grant bonuses so it is very important to go to the lectures.<br /><br />The class is divided into about 10 large groups (pre determined, you can't form your own) and each group works together to complete lecture activities. They can be stressful sometimes as time is limited and you need to fight for the bonus points (0.5 each, up to 3%). Tasks included block programming, typing HTML, presentations etc.<br /><br />Professor speaks good English, and is nice and approachable. He is very laid back and tries really hard to make the lectures fun, so the atmosphere is usually quite good. He is also willing to answer questions after class. However, he doesn't really teach much during class and sometimes rushes through the lecture activities, without ensuring that most of the class has grasped the concepts. For example, during lecture activities, since only one person needs to complete the activity for the whole group to get a bonus, he only focused on the person who completed the task while most of the groupmates had to catch up on their own. His teaching style isn't really the best you can ask for, but he is very clear when he teaches in class or in videos so that's already decent for me.<br /><br />The lab TA doesn't teach especially well but he isn't bad either. He manages to deliver most of the content he needs to and it is not hard for people to follow.",
            "comment_grading": "Most people say it is a good grade course. I'm not sure about that, but I can say that the grading feels quite fair. <br /><br />This course is one of the less transparent ones I've taken. The professor hasn't provided any sort of statistics on the mean or SD of the project or the exams. The statistics of the MC part of the exam, labs and online quizzes can be seen from Canvas, but they are not of much significance.<br /><br />Grading:<br />Exam: 30%<br />Project: 40%<br />Lecture activities: 10%<br />Quizzes: 10%<br />Labs: 10%<br /><br />Online quizzes are often very easy and most people get 0.4-0.5 (out of 0.5) every time. They can't really differentiate the students. It is easy to get full marks for labs as long as you bother to bring your work to the lab for the TA to check. If you let him check in person, and he finds out that you made mistakes, you can change it at the lab until you get full marks. If you're confident you can do it perfectly at home (from my experience, most people find it easy to follow the tasks), you can submit your work via Canvas and you don't even need to show up to the lab.<br /><br />The exam is conducted in the lab, and consists of two parts: MC and practical. I personally found the exam MC quite easy (I studied for a day before the exam). There were 40 questions and according to Canvas the max score is 39. Practical is a bit hard, you get to choose 2 from 4 questions (GIMP photo editing, Word, Excel, Powerpoint). I chose Word and Powerpoint because I found them the easiest. The difficulty of the Excel question was a bit ridiculous in my opinion. Time limit was 2 hours for both parts together, a bit tight.<br /><br />Project grade is mainly made up of technical score and aesthetic scores. For technical scores, you get them as long as you complete that task. For aesthetics, you really need to work hard and see what the professor likes because he really cares about aesthetics lol<br /><br />Didn't really study hard, but I had to make sure I completed all the components and tried to complete a decent project. I got 38/40 for exam MC, 6.95/7 for labs, full for quizzes and attendance plus 3% bonus. Others unknown. Finally got an A+. I think in this course hard work usually pays off.",
            "comment_workload": "A bit on the heavier side, but not really that stressful. You just need to devote time to complete it. <br /><br />During the term (before project), the course is pretty chill except you have to do online quiz. Only one lecture per week and one lab (which you can skip). If you do the labs by yourself, most of them take less than half an hour.<br /><br />Project can technically be done in 1-2 days I think, if you really rush through it. Depending on the scale of the app, it can take way longer to complete. Filming and editing the video can also be time consuming. Also, it depends on your groupmates and the app proposal you choose to work on. Very important to find good groupmates!!!!<br /><br />Workload is insane during the lecture though omg I was so stressed every week during the lecture activities if you're like me and not used to interactive lessons please beware<br /><br />Overall good course though thank you Kenneth it's been a lot of fun :))))",
