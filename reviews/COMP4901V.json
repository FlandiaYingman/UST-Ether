        "description": "In recent years, autonomous vehicles have become an important field in computer vision and artificial intelligence with the strong support of big visual data and powerful deep learning. This course will deliver a knowledge base for students to understand fundamentals in autonomous vehicles, covering three core modules, i.e., perception, localization, prediction and planning, in large-scale contexts within deep learning. Specifically, (i) for the perception module, we introduce techniques for visual understanding of images and videos captured from RGB/LiDAR cameras, including object recognition, 2D/3D detection, semantic/instance segmentation, motion and flow estimation, and multi-task perception; (ii) for the localization module, we cover topics including camera and geometry models, stereo and monocular depth estimation, 3D scene reconstruction, visual odometry, SLAM, and multi-sensor fusion; (iii) for the prediction and planning module, we introduce pedestrian/vehicle trajectory prediction, reinforcement learning, vehicle modeling/control, motion and path planning.",
