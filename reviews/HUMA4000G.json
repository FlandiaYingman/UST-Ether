        "description": "This course examines Hong Kong's evolving and many-faceted character through the lens of literature and film, both looking from the outside (English-language novels and films) and from the inside via local fiction, poetry, and film in English translation. Instead of looking at external representations and internal expressions separately, this course views the image of Hong Kong as a global conversation, in which internal and external voices influence each other both through tension and harmony. That is, what may often be dismissed as \"Hollywood fantasy\" or commercial fiction are put on the same playing field as serious local culture and viewed comparatively in their participation in an evolving global conversation about what Hong Kong is.",
