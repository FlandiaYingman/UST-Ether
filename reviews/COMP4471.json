        "description": "Deep learning has significantly advanced the performance of computer vision system from object recognition to image processing. This course covers the basics and various applications of deep learning in computer vision. Students will study the details of convolutional neural networks as well as recurrent neural networks and train deep networks with end-to-end optimization, and learn deep learning based approaches for both high-level and low-level computer vision tasks such as image recognition and image enhancement. Through programming projects, students will implement, train, and test deep neural networks on cutting-edge computer vision research. Students would be required to study or do research in a final course project related to deep learning and computer vision and present their work by the end of the course.",

However, his voice is too soft and I can even hear better in zoom rather than sitting in the classroom, which is ironic. Also, his delivery skill is not good such that it is quite difficult to understand what he wants to present even the concepts or contents are easy.<br /><br />There are some lecture videos on Youtube of CS231n. You may want to watch those videos to understand the major content of this course, which is recommended. The lecture slides are also mainly come from CS231n.<br /><br />There are Lab session for helping students to understand the coding in deep learning and help them for finishing the assignments. You can watch the lab videos if you want on the course website and visit the related tutorials posted, although those hyperlinks are mostly outdated or 404 not found. D:<br /><br />Assignments are copied from CS231n, you can find many useful reference on web. However, the assignments are using outdated version of Tensorflow and PyTorch (Tensorflow v1 D:).

It is open book so that you can view your notes on your notebook, which saves your time from reciting those concepts and architectures. <br /><br />Project workload is varied and depended. You can choose any&nbsp;&nbsp;topic you want related to Computer Vision. The most time-consuming part is the final report. It needs to be written in CVPR style for 6-8 pages.",

The syllabus is basically the same.<br /><br />Three Python programming assignments. Can be easily sourced from various Github pages. Coding from scratch may take days and requires proficiency in NumPy and PyTorch. Luckily you can learn these packages when doing homework with these references.<br /><br />The midterm is conventional. No coding and mostly chain rule. I attach one of the past papers to give you an idea.<br /><br />The project requires 1-3 people per group. It could be a realization of a conference paper, some experiments on a new dataset, etc. etc. At last, you need to write a research paper of 6-8 pages in CVPR style.",

Here are some statistics of me and my friends:<br />96/100: A+<br />94/100: A<br />92/100: A-<br />The bins seem tight, but since everyone is doing great in assignments and projects, the only difference lies in midterm.

However, more time is needed if no prior Numpy or Anaconda experience.<br /><br />Midterm takes about a weekend to review.<br /><br />Project workload largely depends on the topic your group chooses. I would say it's time-consuming to write 6-8 pages in CVPR style. Just go check one of the CVPR papers to get a grip of what that means.",
