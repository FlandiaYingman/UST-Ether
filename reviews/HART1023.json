        "description": "This introductory course aims at guiding students to explore the art of animation through producing drawing, cut-ups, roto-scoping, photographic and object animation with digital and traditional tools. By introducing non-mainstream techniques and mediums for creating time-based imagery, students will learn both practical skills and theories of animation as a visual art form for artistic expression and communication. Through brief lecturing, students will acquaint themselves with the history and development of experimental animation and its influences to moving image arts in general. The hands-on activities will allow students to explore freely the principles of animation starting from manual techniques such as simple flip-books and zoetropes. Students will also learn to create animation from common computer software, such as Photoshop and Aftereffect.",

But it would be better or easier to follow if you have some computer skills in apps like Photoshop, or else it would be a bit hard for students to understand the steps.",

Then you will do the first draft, which is like a simple version of the final work. After these you do the final work. This can be very time-consuming. You need a month for this project, and you are required to draw hundreds of pictures to make your hand-drawn animation. Other kinds of animation requires similar workload.",
