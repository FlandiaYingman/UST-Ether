Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment.",

The students consist of people from CS, CPEG, DSCT, and RMBI. If you take a look at the pre-requisite, either COMP4211 or ISOM 3360 can fulfill the pre-requisite. However, these two courses are at completely different levels of difficulty and you can also imagine that RMBI students are less trained in coding and math. Eventually, the professor has to teach some&nbsp;&nbsp;ML content in a very simple way, otherwise, it will be too hard for RMBI students.<br /><br />The content is broken because there is a great duplication to other ML courses. And other topics are just not taught in-depth enough. But please don't blame things on the professor and the TAs, they work really hard. A better solution is to design two separate courses for CS CPEG DSCT and RMBI.",

I actually quite enjoy working on these assignments.<br /><br />The final is the main factor of the overall grade. The truth is that everyone has a different perspective on the difficulty.

If you have taken a basic ML course but are new to its applications for text or graphs, this course is for you.<br /><br />Since this course is designed for both CS and business students, the teaching favours breadth over depth. If you would like to understand the theory behind the various ML methods covered, consider taking a different course. Also, the pacing is quite slow, so you may get bored if you are already somewhat familiar with ML.<br /><br />Note that although there is a tentative schedule (see below), the topics are not necessarily covered in order; some of the contents even belong to multiple topics.<br /><br />[Topics]<br />1. Introduction<br />2. New Applications of Big Data Mining<br />3. Introduction to Deep Learning<br />4. Text Mining in Recommendation<br />5. Graph Mining in Recommendation<br />6. Heterogeneous Information Mining in Recommendation<br />7. More Techniques and Applications<br />8. Conclusions",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor goes into the course material in much detail, especially whenever math is involved, so that business students can still follow the content. If you come from a CS background, it is easy to lose focus; unless you want the bonus marks, I recommend you just skip the lectures and review the recordings at 2x speed.<br /><br />He tries to keep the class lively by allocating some time to Q&amp;A sessions, in which he asks questions to the class and allows a variable number of students (sometimes more than 10) to answer them for bonus marks.<br /><br />Each tutorial is split into two parts: a brief review of the topics covered in the lecture, and an overview of example Python code implementing those concepts. However, for the most part, the TAs did not explain the code in detail, so you might as well just go through the code yourself.",
            "comment_grading": "[Projects (50-60%)]<br />There are a total of 3 group projects. Students can form groups of 1-4 which remain the same throughout the whole course.<br /><br />Each project corresponds to one of the aspects of a recommendation system: sentiment analysis, social network mining, and rating prediction.<br /><br />In each project, the group is required to develop a model for the given task and write a report on the process. The model accounts for the majority of the score and is graded based on its performance compared to predefined baselines. The report accounts for the remainder of the score and is graded based on content.<br /><br />[Presentation (10%)]<br />At the end of the course, each group is required to conduct a 3-minute presentation to the rest of the class about one or more of their projects.<br /><br />The presentation is graded on: content clearness, description of methods, experiments and components, insight sharing, and time management.<br /><br />[Final Exam (30-40%)]<br />This is a 3-hour open-book written exam. Students can type out their answers, and even search the internet, but no communication is allowed.<br /><br />The exam consists of a small number of T/F questions, with the rest being short questions. Some of the short questions are straightforward, such as doing hand calculations for TF-IDF, convolution, and node2vec; others involve understanding ML models that make use of the layers (in Keras terms) taught in class. Note that these models can range from fairly simple ones, such as vanilla Bi-LSTM, to very complicated ones introduced recently; it would do well to be proficient at literature review on ML papers in general.<br /><br />While the mean compared to last year may suggest otherwise, the difficulty of the exam has indeed been reduced: the SOTA models featured in this year's exam are much easier to understand.<br /><br />I would like to emphasise the importance of being able to run model.summary() in your head: in this year's exam, out of 100 marks, 12 are earned from determining the tensor shape and 30 from calculating the number of parameters. Honestly, I feel that whoever designed this paper has some obsession with this task; it would be great if they could come up with other ways to test our knowledge.<br /><br />[Bonus Marks (+2%)]<br />As mentioned in the Teaching session, students can earn bonus marks by participating in the Q&amp;A sessions. Each question answered earns 1% of the overall grade, up to a maximum of 2%.<br /><br />[My Grades]<br />Note that the mark distribution between the projects and the final exam depends on the difficulty of the final exam (higher difficulty results in larger weight for the projects). There has been no announcement about this since then.<br /><br />I am not aware of any grading split between CS and business students this year, but just in case: I enrolled in this course under COMP.<br /><br />Projects: 296/300 (Mean: 289.3)<br />Presentation: ??? (Mean: ???)<br />Final Exam: 79.9/100 (Mean: 57.4, Max: 91.0)<br />Bonus: +1%<br /><br />Grade: A+",

As a result, the grading for some phases is looser but the grading for the phase required final result is much more tighter.<br />For assignment and test, since majority of question contains exact answer, the marking is strict-forward.<br />The final grade of this course is nice. Student can obtain most of the score for assignment and project through using coupon. The final grade is depends on the result of mid-term test and final exam.",
