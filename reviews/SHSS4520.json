        "description": "The course introduces students to the major methodological approaches in qualitative research in the humanities and social sciences, including (1) ethnographic fieldwork, (2) discourse/cultural analysis, and (3) comparative and historical case studies. Qualitative research approaches the subject of study holistically and contextually, whether about a community, a site, a case or a structure. The course teaches the skills of participant-observation, thick description, critical interpretation and comparative analysis, and focuses on the methods of interpretation as well as explanation of a variety of social, cultural and political issues in historical and contemporary contexts. It provides hands-on research experience and ensures a balance between breadth in coverage and depth in application. It will be of use to students interested in learning the craft of qualitative research. For students in Year two or above only.",
