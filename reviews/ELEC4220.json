        "description": "This course introduces basic building blocks of robots: actuators (DC and servo motors), sensors (proprioceptive/exteroceptive, passive/active); controller platforms as well as mechanical modules; and basic concepts of robotics: rigid motion and configuration space, kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generation and planning, locomotion, localization and mapping, navigation and control. Using these basic building blocks and robotic concepts, students will learn how to design and build a robot prototype that meets certain design specifications. Design examples include a mobile robot to engage in a competition, a robotic manipulator in a typical assembly task, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a surveillance application, etc.",
