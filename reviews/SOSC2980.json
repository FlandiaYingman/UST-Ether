You will spend more time learning about the psychoanalytic (extremely odd but interesting, especially if you like penises) and trait approaches, which will be tested on the midterm. The behavioral, humanistic, cognitive, and biological approaches are tested on the final. <br /><br />The content is great in the sense that it provides insight into and allows you to think about your own and others' personalities through many different perspectives, including but not limited to childhood, behavior, culture, etc.",

Her teaching style makes it very easy to follow. She also gives out free lecture notes during class.",

The readings are indulging but account for half the textbook for the midterm and final respectively and do take some time to fully digest.<br /><br />Attending the morning lectures seemed hard at first, but the good teaching made up for the early lectures. <br /><br />Oh and there's a case study. It was relatively easy due to the fact that it was due after the final and mainly uses concepts from one approach that was tested on the midterm, so you know what's going on when analyzing the case. The hardest part is making it concise enough to fit into 10 pages.",

She treated the class as a 'mom style'. She cared about each student. Her funny and interactive way of teaching made the 3 hour class cool. She included many experience in the class so the pace of teaching is quite slow. And in the last week of course, she lagged behind the syllabus and became much more efficient in terms in teaching which seems better to us.<br /><br />She included a personality test at the beginning of the course so we can understand ourself better.",

It seems quite manageable to our group. But one of the group only consist 3 people and I am not sure about their workload. It was not that hard to write it as long as you have good group mates.<br /><br />Midterm and final were the most challenging part of the course, you have to study both course material and read the textbook.

One would have to read the case study and give a 10-page report (only one per group, not individually) on the personality based on the trait approach. <br />Class participation was based on the quality of questions asked on the query sheet.",
