Students shall try to understand what the problem was, how it was addressed, how it worked out and attempt to learn what marked it as a success and how portable the practice can be. The principle purpose is to expose students to a wide range of good case histories in order to enhance their repertoire and experience in OM.",

            "comment_content": "This course comes in 8 themes subject to changes during the semester, but it's basically operational analytics. We dealt with cases relating to staff scheduling and workforce planning (that spans a few cases because it's really big), revenue management, healthcare and non-profit organizations, and a case on supply chain/ inventory management optimization illustrated by Zara.<br /><br />You'll need some but not a lot of OM concepts already in your mind before taking this course, e.g. Little's law, because he can go quite fast especially if there are some OM gods who know everything taking the class with you.",
            "comment_teaching": "His classes are very interesting and the important points are shown very clearly. I'll suggest that you don't print out the notes because there are a lot of pictures that he found or took to illustrate the concepts, but if it actually happens that he didn't go through those pictures, you can take a look at them yourself.<br /><br />He also welcomes outside-class contact, but depending on his schedule, you may not have much time to ask him questions after class. In that case, you may want to email him for questions and he'll reply quite soon. Otherwise, it's also nice to talk to him without any agenda lol<br /><br />Finally, he provides very good feedback to everything you do... including the fact that your group made a pretty bad sentence somewhere in the case assignment.",
            "comment_grading": "Distribution:<br />Case memos -- 36% (case presentation is not graded! just don't waste your time making a template okay)<br />Class participation -- 10%<br />Team project -- 18% (it is about an OM problem for which you'll make a model/ recommend solutions; a presentation is also required, but also not graded)<br />Peer evaluation -- 10% <br />Quiz -- 26% (in-class, 60 minutes, open everything except internet.)<br /><br />Our group was super - we got perfect scores in almost all cases. That, coupled with having 21/23.5 in a quiz with average around 17.5 (= median) and SD around 2.555, and other components for which I don't know the results of, I got an A+. <br /><br />General conclusion for taking Prof Li's classes - participation is king. Make sure he remembers you positively. Go to the weekly-ish office hours to clarify with him on the cases and project as much as possible. You'll get a lot of insight on the actual OM question you deal with in the cases/ project, AND Prof. Li's opinion of what you're doing (if he says you're in great shape, good job!)<br /><br />Also, trust him when he says &quot;don't study&quot; for the quiz because you won't understand like half the questions, so just download all the materials onto the laptop and be ready to CTRL + F or GUESS.",
            "comment_workload": "I understand how all that is necessary because of the themes it is supposed to encompass, but 6 cases throughout the semester with a project and a quiz in which even having all the notes will NOT help answering? <br /><br />Why is this a 3-credit course? #crying_in_workload<br />I can't give this part any better rating even if I love Prof Li's classes to bits, so unless you're enrolling for the prof or friends, please consider taking something else, like ISOM4540 (time series analysis and forecasting) - it's a 4-credit course and its workload isn't even as heavy.",

You need to develop very feasible and technical solutions for a company. A 15-minute presentation is required.<br /><br />DO NOT ENROLL THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED! YOU WILL GET CRAZY!",

            "comment_content": "The course is basically occupied by case studies, there is a new case every 1.5 weeks and every team have to do a 3 page write up for every case. But each group only needs to present one case for, say so, 45 minutes. Plus a final presentation on a selected topic of Best Practices, and an open book quiz. After the course, you will learn how OM tactics like Solver, auction, queening model and others can be put into reality.",
            "comment_teaching": "As said, this is a case based teaching, so SEEK GOOD TEAMMATES in the first place. While doing the case, since there are no so called &quot;model answer&quot;, so it is up to you to dig very deep or submit superficial answers. Therefore, this teaching method suits the self-motivated ones.<br /><br />For the presentation, if the presenters did everything right, the prof will use his remaining lecture time for supplementary information; and if the presenters get something wrong, the prof. will always give the the &quot;recommended&quot; way to solve the case problem, so you can always learn the &quot;best practice&quot; in the industry.<br /><br />One thing that I super love about the professor, is the speediness of assignment marking, he usually mark our assignment within 4.5 hours of submission, this makes sure our memories are fresh before receiving any feedback. And the quality of marking is very adequate given the time constrain. Students will know which point they made are tacking the problem and of which are inappropriate. Overall, the motivation of student, teammates and the professor composes a very good learning experiences.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is very fair with a relatively large variance. Being a course heavily assessed on cases studies, without a &quot;model answer&quot;, you can score a very nice result if you are fully devoted, since both the TA and prof can truly feel your passion. But vice-versa, so at least you will not come up with a situation that a hard work is spent but ending up with a bad grade only due to careless mistakes or some stupid reasons. The correlation of Grade and you Effort is very positive for this case.",
            "comment_workload": "This might be the only downside of this course, the workload actually resembles a 4 credit courses, but since most of the time is spent on project and discussion with your teammates, but not lectures, one should find working on it a pretty enjoyable experience. For the good side, you only have to do minimum revision before the quiz (there is no final, and is probably the reason why it only worth 3 credits). Where you have gone through the projects, the memories of OM applications should have been staying in your mind, that you can recall it easily without prior study.",
