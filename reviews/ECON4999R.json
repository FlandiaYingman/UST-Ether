        "description": "In this course, we shall study the causes and consequences of international trade, the political economy of trade and trade policies. Course consists of two parts. Part I discusses the pattern of international trade, why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains from trade. Part II analyzes the motives for countries to implement policies that restrict international trade, and the welfare implications of those trade policies. Economic models will be used extensively to analyze the questions whenever necessary, and the application of these models to the real world would also be emphasized. Real world issues and policies will be discussed throughout the course. These include trade agreements, trade war, World Trade Organization, and so on. The cases in the textbook would be frequently used to illustrate how the theory is applied to the real world.",
