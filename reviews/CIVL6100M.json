        "description": "Discrete choice modeling framework and stated choice methods are widely applied across diverse fields to study the behavioral responses of individuals, households and organizations. This course is designed to provide both theory and practical experience in the building and estimating of advanced discrete choice models, as well as in generating stated choice experimental designs. This course covers both traditional discrete choice models and future developments in the field of discrete choice analysis including risk attitude and perceptual conditioning. This course also places the focus on generating stated choice surveys for answering real-world research questions and building models using real data. The techniques gained in this course are transferable to diverse areas of researching, such as transportation, logistics, health services, marketing, economics, tourism, planning. Instructor's approval is required.",
