The criteria for us was almost the same as the presentation criteria, so it's pretty much the same workload but you gotta do it all by yourself.

It can get a bit dry at times especially since there are a lot of frameworks, but once you get the gist of it you'll be fine. The course focuses on the application of frameworks and you'll have to apply these frameworks for your group project and in-class case studies.",

He might get boring at times, but it really depends on your own interest in the subject. He'll also encourage you to speak up in class and gives out participation cards for speaking up.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is quite good. As long as you attend all his classes, you'll get attendance points (5%). Though you'll have to speak up in class in order to get participation points, which counts for 10% of your grade. <br /><br />Midterm is quite easy. 40 MCQs and 8 short answer questions. <br /><br />Final exam has 40 MCQs and a mini case study and approx 8 open ended questions that are worth approx 4-10 marks each. Come prepared for the final exam as the case study is quite tough. <br /><br />You can easily score for the group project depending on the company that you choose. Your group mates are randomly assigned. You'll have to submit a final report and give a presentation to the class.",
            "comment_workload": "Personally, I think that the workload for this course is very light as I enjoyed reading the case studies. You don't really have to prep much. Just make sure that you understand and remember the frameworks taught in the previous lectures. His exams are non-cumulative so you don't have to worry so much about cramming. Just focus on understanding the concepts and it'll be fine. <br /><br />I was lucky to have good group mates and we decided on things pretty fast, so we managed to get things done efficiently. You should also choose a company that you are genuinely interested in so that your group project will be fun and you won't feel like its a burden.",

Some words being used in the ppt are very difficult to me and made it hard to understand so I have to look up from the dictionary a lot. <br />A case study pack will be given to students and there will be case discussion in class throughout the semester. the cases are around 10-20 pages long. You will have to read the cases beforehand in order to answer the PRS questions and participate in class.",

But then other times he was basically reading powerpoint slides and his accent sometimes makes it hard to listen to what he is talking about. <br />Also during case discussion, he would jot down the points on papers and uses a projector to show us. But with his messy handwriting, it was difficult to read.",

It was said that you will have to answer at least 1q to get full attendance mark. <br /><br />Participation: 10 <br />- You will have to answer a lot of questions in class and the best chance is during case discussion. And it actually counts a lot. Can affect your subgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Mid-term exam: 20 <br />- MC with a few short questions. <br /><br />Final exam: 25<br />- MC, 5-page case questions and a few long questions. MC was said to be non-cumulative but turns out to be including the Midterm stuff. <br /><br />Group final project: 40 <br />- including presentation and final report. For the topic, you will have to analyze the corporate strategies of the company that you have chosen and then suggest possible ways to tackle the issues. Groups are being assigned by the prof but he really values peer evaluation, so if you have a serious issue, feel free to show him the proof.<br /><br />I didn't miss any PRS attendance but should have zero for participation. My midterm was below mean for 2.5 marks, final being 9 marks above mean. Our group project was really good and among the highest. At last, I got an A.",
