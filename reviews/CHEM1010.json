Some topics may be new to you (eg. quantum mechanics, ch.2, molecular orbital model, dsp3, ch.4), these topics will usually account for a higher percentage in exams. Some topics are easier than high school chemistry (eg. chemical energy, ch.7)<br /><br />If you studied chemistry and physics in high school, you cannot learn many new things in this course. <br /><br />Midterm: 45 MCQ, no difficult calculations, no calculators<br />Ch1: 30%<br />Ch2: 50%<br />Ch3: 20%<br /><br />Final: 50% MCQ, 50% fill in the blanks + long questions + Q&amp;A + ... , you should bring a simple scientific calculator<br />Ch3: 10%<br />Ch4: 50%<br />Ch5: 10%<br />Ch6: 10%<br />Ch7: 10%<br />Ch8: 10%",

You could ask her question after class in English or Cantonese, but you were not allowed to ask her questions in Cantonese in class in order to be fair to everyone.<br /><br />There was a 30 minute tutorial taught by a TA before the final exam. Some basic sample questions were provided. The time was very limited and I don't think it is very helpful.<br /><br />There were special office hours before the exams for students to ask questions.<br /><br />You could check you paper after the exams but you could neither take photos nor take your paper away.<br /><br />Not many people attended the lessons.",
