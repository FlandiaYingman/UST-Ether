            "comment_content": "The similarity between SOSC1200 and SOSC1210 is that the content of the class is made up of different aspects from different instructors or staffs.<br /><br />In the beginning, Cameron will check your attendance, while in the last weeks of the semester due to the content is not closely related to everyone in the class so attending the class is optional. It's considerate of Cameron to briefly introduce the content of the course that week and inform us whether attendance is needed on Canvas.<br /><br />As QSA was first established in 2017 so it seemed that in the first set of courses Cameron just tried his best to convince us that there could be good future respects for us if we complete our course and get experienced when studying in the University. Since there are only a few majors similar to QSA around the world so we can only believe him and convince ourselves...<br /><br />Weeks later the content is much more interesting. Cameron invited staffs from Language Center, Entretership Center, Redbird, etc. to introduce how to make good use of opportunities provided by HKUST. Introduction of double major and minors are also included. <br /><br />In November we are required to participate in a library workshop telling us where and how to find good data for social science research. According to the workshop, you need to write some paragraphs of what will you do to use data to work for the social science topic which you are interested in. Apart from data collection, you need to come up with 2 short briefing for your research interest and study plan. I'm not sure whether they will work for the rest of my life(啥= =) but you will think about your future when completing them.",
            "comment_teaching": "Cameron is not the kind of person who can deliver good presentations. As the classes in this semester are both introductory so he acted more like a guide rather than an instructor. But he will give you all the knowledge and experiences he has.<br /><br />BTW a friend of mine who took SOSC5110 this semester said he was really strict in the research tutorial.<br />Bad news.",
            "comment_grading": "A little disappointed that he only gave me an A.<br /><br />Full points for attendance and participation.<br />4/5 for research interest.<br />5/5 for data collection.<br />5/5 for study plan.<br /><br />It seems that if you want to get an A+ you need to get full points and have good luck.",
