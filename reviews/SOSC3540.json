Reply to your questions/emails very quickly, even at midnight. Should be very generous in grading. <br /><br />It is great that he would give you feedback about your essays so you know how to improve in the next assignments. And he can finish grading your assignment including giving you constructive comments/advice in a very short period of time.<br /><br />Showing your personal effort in addition to the quality of your written assignments is also important to score high.<br /><br />Lecture notes contain little elaboration. You need to attend the lecture and jot down notes in order to understand the content of each topic. The readings are super super important for writing the essays. Read as many as you can. But only readings of 1-3 topics would be used in writing each essay, that is why you have to invest lots of effort but most effort would be useless in doing the assignments because most readings and lecture content won't be used in completing the assignments.",
