Cryptography (RSA)<br /><br />========Part Three: Counting principle==========<br /><br />TL;DR: One of the hardest types of question appears here! You have to prove identity, usually combinatorial approach instead of analytic. It is quite difficult because you may not figure out the correct scenario for the proof!<br /><br />vi.

For number theory, only basic congruences, Euclidean algorithm, Chinese remainder theorem and Fermat's little theorem are taught. For combinatorics, you need to know how to count with star-and-bars and some common double counting skills. For expected value, probability and graph theory, you only need to know very basic stuff.<br /><br />People who are trained in HK IMO team should find this course very easy since secondary olympiad math is way more comprehensive and in depth than this course. I'm honestly, a little disappointed in this fact since it's supposed to be an honour course.<br /><br />BTW, there are enough supplementary exercises for students who wish to practise more, which is a big plus for the course.",

Btw it is not difficult, just some terminology.<br />(2) would be a really conceptual topic, no matter how much or how less u memorised, as long as u can use the logic rule to solve problems is ok. Btw I think thz topic would be a good math foundation for one considering taking 3000-4000 math ug courses.<br />(3) (4) is just slightly &gt; dse lv core math + m1, with sth new like pigenhole and inclusion-exclusion. Btw thz part also overlaps with some math 2000 lv stat prob course, (2411, 21, 31...), which are also in comp curriculum. I think the cse dept should really re-consider to construct a better course structure...<br />(5) is about mod operation. Comp 1000lv prog course gives u insight, but this course gives u a more in-depth knowledge. Better take it serious for its wide application in many other Comp theory courses or even courses in diff subj, e.g. math courses like Abstract algebra, Number Theory.<br />(6) is just an extension of Dse lv m2 version MI. Again, what's inmportant is the idea. The stupid work flow and clumsy format would not really bother u much once u get the whole picture<br />For (7) I think prof usually doesn't hv too much time to cover it. Just like in thz sem, basically he just introduced some terminology and definitions. But those fancy terms are stll important. What u hv to do to deal with thz chapter is memorising stuffs as much as possible. In thz way u cen prevent any &quot;surprises&quot; in final exam.",

For most of the topics, he would like to explain by writing everything on board, but not by using ppt slides or showing his work on projector. Plus he does not really hv a nice handwriting. So one might expect to be really concentrated in the lesson to get the idea.<br /><br />Another thing is, some notes or ppt slides he provides in advance are just other profâ€™s work. And he just provide to us for ref, but does not choose to follow them strictly. For some topics like (5) concerning number theory and (7) graph theory he even told us to ignore those slides, but instead search Rosens textbook for the definitions and thms he illustrated in the lesson. So u may really want to get a Rosen e-book just in case. Luckily there are some free online versions ~<br /><br />And he somehow hates people using smart phone in class, but he just managed to accpet student using computers... So u either use phone in secret or use ur computers in class&nbsp;&nbsp;for learning or other(?) purposes.<br /><br />Overall his teaching is good and the course really equip u with solid knowledge of some discrete math tools.

But i think it is just becoz of their strong academic background...<br />U know, nds and even some locals are really gd at math and logic... <br />(Thz might explain why as an average-lv HK-er, I only can get a A- grade...)<br />(Btw no offense.)<br /><br />One thing gd is, prof is willing to provide pp for us to prepare for mid and final. He may even send u pp in last several sems, as long as sby request in class. And some of the Qs would really re-appear in ur mid / final paper,<br />meaning that u would hv less risk relative to other comp courses when dealing with exams.<br /><br />Overall, hard-working can help for obtaining gd grade, which is good for a comp course.",

We are talking abt some REAL stuff here. So just be early planned and better prepared. <br /><br />One thing good is, prof allows or u may say he encourages u to hand in a printed version of ur hw. Plus he specifies that poor hand-writing in hw might cause a lower marks. So u can actually use MS Word or Latex to finish ur hw, which is good for a bad writer like me.<br /><br />For the difficulty lv, some of the hws would be as difficult as those math honor courses (1023, 24, 2131,...). But as the course title suggested, it is also a H course, so u just gotta deal with it.<br /><br />To sum up, u might want to expect to hv a huge workload if u r not really that familiar with math.
