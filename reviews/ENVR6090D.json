        "description": "The world’s businesses and governments must take aggressive and coordinated steps in order to avert a climate catastrophe. Carbon finance (investments in systems, companies and projects that sequester carbon) and the creation of new financial instruments that price carbon emissions – is a critical part of this required transformation of the global economy. This course will explore the science of climate change, its economic and environmental impacts, and financial tools that can be used to accelerate the sequestration and capture of carbon. Focus areas are: capital markets and exchanges, emissions trading systems, investments in low emissions technologies, project finance for renewables and property/energy efficiency, corporate finance of decarbonisation, carbon credits/offsets, and related regulatory changes.",
