Some of the typos are not minor at all as some of them include formulas. If you didn't attend the lectures or didn't pay attention in the lecture, you might blindly follow the formulas when doing homework and get a wrong answer. <br /><br />As for the lab sessions, I skipped most of them so I can't say much about it. All I know is I heard the TA didn't prepare quite well and was late.",
            "comment_grading": "This semester is online so it might not be a good reference if you are taking this course face-to-face.<br /><br />My score:<br />Homework (30%): 760/800<br />Midterm (30%): 60/60<br />Final (40%): ?/100<br />Grade: A<br /><br />Midterm stat (from canvas):<br />Min: 10<br />Max: 60 <br />Mean: 49.33<br /><br />Final exam stat: not provided<br /><br />There is a total of 8 homework, 1 of them is optional and doesn't count towards grades. 2 of them includes coding. The homework questions are not so easy compared to exam questions. <br /><br />Getting full mark in midterm is not as incredible as you think(at least in my semester). Since the actual full mark of the paper is 70. There is one bonus question which weights 10 marks. As long as attempt to do it you should be able to get some bonus marks. Even if you get 70 marks your final score is still 60.<br /><br />Both midterm and final exam are online proctored(in this semester) and open-book so you don't need to memorize the formulas. Midterm however, prohibits the use of calculator. This is tedious because you will need to calculate the confidence interval(CI) where you need to calculate the sample variance and sample mean of the data by hand. The question asking CI has more than 10 samples and each data is either a 3-digit number or 4-digit number, so this is where most of your exam time is going to be used on.",
            "comment_workload": "The grading weight of homework and midterm are equal(both 30%) so it is NOT a good idea to be deadline fighter for the assignments. <br /><br />From my personal experience, the first coding homework was surprisingly difficult which requires some coding knowledge such as for-loop and appending data into a list which is not explicitly taught in the lectures or lab sessions (meaning you can't copy-paste the code from lab notes and call it a day). <br />Make sure you start your assignments at least one day before the deadline in case you found difficulties in doing some questions. That way, you have time to ask the professor as well as give time for the professor to answer your questions.<br /><br />For the exam preparation, doing the past paper provided and re-doing the homework problems should be fine. Since the exam is open-book, it is a good idea to print the lecture notes where it includes the key formulas such as formulas for CI and hypothesis testing.",

More in depth topic in probability and statistics are discussed. You will need to pay more attention in lectures in order to understand the content.<br /><br />Compared to MATH 2411, this course discusses a wider range of content and in more depth. For example, chi-squared tests, multiple linear regression, methods for deriving estimators (MoM, MLE) are discussed.

He proved himself teaching quite well when he started to move on to the more difficult topics. He tried to explain things clearly with nicely prepared slides.

For the topics that is more difficult, he would still leave us some insights (as a supplementary topic not examined or give references) instead of leaving them untied. <br /><br />The professor was also quite responsible. He responded to emails and addressed issues promptly. Although I seldom ask him questions regarding to the lecture, he explained quite clearly for the question that I had in the assignment.",

Only 1 past paper is given and it format is not similar due to the change in teaching mode. The exam would not be too difficult if you prepare well.",
