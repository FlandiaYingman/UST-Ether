        "description": "Each student team is to create a business plan involving 3D printing. The technology of 3D printing is at the tipping point of going “mainstream”. It has moved beyond being a gimmicky toy to becoming a vital part of modern industrial processes and products. Car companies are printing entire concept cars, aerospace companies are printing parts for the production of planes, and some users are printing their own spare parts. Enrollment in the project course requires approval of the course instructor.",
