        "description": "This course attempts to examine the narration of Chinese history in film from both historical and visual perspectives in light of such issues as gender and nationalism, the revolutionary aesthetics, the city and the country, nostalgia and historical imagination, and the negotiations of the Chinese modern and cultural identity in the new cinemas in the global context.",

            "comment_content": "The course offers an interesting and valuable insight into topics that non-Chinese background students may not come across that easily. It also serves as an introduction to film studies and is generally quite comprehensive. It covers the basics about how documentary as a genre evolved globally and then shows certain features using Chinese (Taiwanese, HK and Mainland) independent documentaries.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is effective and the professor introduces the topics very well. The discussions are relevant and informative. Every lecture consists of an introduction by the professor, one full documentary, discussion of this and perhaps other clips and a quick tutorial with group discussions.",
            "comment_grading": "Provided one pays attention in class and reads the required readings, getting an A shouldn't be difficult. Without attending the lectures however, this is nearly impossible.",
            "comment_workload": "One group presentation and one essay as well as in-class quizzes and a final. Again, if one does all the readings, attends lectures and puts an effort into it, it is certainly a rewarding course. The essay was shorter than 1500 words, so the difficulty was not to find content, but to sort out all that is not necessary.",
