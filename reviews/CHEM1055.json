The exam is not hard at all, going through the lab manual and your reports once before the exam is enough.<br />For me, I got full mark for performance, of course. And I managed to get full mark in final as well(mean:30.3/40). In the first eight experiment, I had two lower than means and six higher than means. However, I forgot to submit my last report and get 0 for that one (I even finished my electronic report but forgot to submit on canvas, partly because of the fucking study break which is right after my last session).

In Expt. 4's lab report, you need to do some really lousy calculations on the solutions' buffering capacities &amp; something relevant to the Henderson-Hasselbach Equation. This is the most troublesome one of all reports of this course.<br /><br />In the Final Exam, there was at least one question about calculating the buffering capacity. Pay attention to this during revision.<br /><br />Since I took this course in Year 4 &amp; had already done with the more crazily complicated Syn Lab &amp; MC Lab in previous years, this lab course isn't hard for me. <br /><br />Many people completed almost every experiment in an hour.

Remember to jot down any notes that are in the PowerPoints but not in the lab manual such as some chemicals which are not stated. Listen carefully to the instructions of TAs when they are teaching about the skills of handling glass wares like the proper way to hold a dropper. Many of the above will be examined. Besides, it is better to do pre-lab preparation thoroughly since some TAs may ask you questions suddenly and monitor if you make mistakes through out the experiment.",

It is very easy to get high marks in every lab report if you have carefully thought about the answers before entering the lab. Read through the lab manual again and that's all for final exam. The final exam consists of about 55 MC questions in 1 hour. It was not too rush because the questions were not so difficult. I got about 18/20 in every lab report and about 6 answers wrong in exam, contributing to A+.",
