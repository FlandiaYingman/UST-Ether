        "description": "Sustainability -- or the principles, strategies, and practices that enable organizations to thrive and endure while contributing to g economic growth, social progress, and environmental resilience -- is a megatrend that is transforming companies, markets and societies. As awareness of sustainability rises amongst consumers and across society, the dynamics of industry competition also change. Companies that use the lens of sustainability to drive innovation, create new business models, and shape future markets establish new sources of competitive advantage that could be both financially profitable and socially and environmentally rewarding. This course will provide an understanding of the fundamental aspects of sustainability, both environmentally and socially, as a business issue and how these affect corporate strategy, operations, culture and competitiveness. In particular, the course will examine how these might have shifted, or accelerated, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and how business is responding.",
