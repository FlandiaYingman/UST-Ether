            "comment_teaching": "Prof teaches quite well, illustrates concepts with bunch of examples. After all he really do teaching for 20-30 years...<br /><br />But one thing i dont really like abt him, is that he kind of gives a hard time students when taking attendance. Attendance counts for 20%, 2% for each lessons (initially). Most of them being dome in iPRS. Sometimes before playing some relevant videos, he would distribute worksheets in advance for us to drop down something to ans some Qs. But one time he caught us unprepared; playing several videos, with some explanations by him in btw. Then guess wht, after playing all, he suddenly distributed sheets, told us to ans LQs in only 10-20 min. That's really not a good way to treat students I would say.<br /><br />And becoz of freq iPRS malfunctioning, in the last few lessons we are forced to ans make-up Qs abt the previous lectures. Those iPRS, for start, are scheduled at the beginning of a lesson, which make some students (not including me) unavoidably suffer. What make it more worse, is that those make-up Qs are abt some random videos he played. Some even req us to count the occurence of sth in the video. I believe everyone would agree it is not possible for a student to study &quot;extra materials&quot; in such a detailed way, at least for me it is the case. You may even here people's complains in a quite XXX way during the iPRS session. <br /><br />From thz u can see how he treat students, considering that all of us are being serious to take thz cc at winter term. <br /><br />Overall, he is a good teacher, but definitely not the king u would like to meet for cc.",

You would expect to write one 2-paged essay each week and keep reading in all 3 weeks. <br /><br />One thing worth to mention is that, he allowed open-book, but only his textbook is allowed. You cannot bring out all ur ppt slides into exam venue. You must be careful enough to spot out the diff in textbook and slides then drop down key pts in textbook. <br /><br />Nut besides that, u hv nothing to do, even for the iPRS, u can just look for some others' ans, sometimes it is even faster than blindly search for ur notes and internet.

Start doing your case study earlier to get yourself enough time to digest the cases.<br /><br />You have a quiz every day. The quizzes are usually about the things taught the day before or on that day. Make sure you watch every video that the professor requested you to watch because the questions from the quizzes are usually about the videos.<br /><br />There are a lot of supplementary readings that are not necessary to read.

I guess I was tricked by some questions (probably 3-4) because I didn’t think carefully enough (I just relied on what are presented in the textbook). Though, B+ is acceptable for me. At least my disastrous Fall GPA got some improvement because of this extra B+. <br /><br />I think TAs graded the assignments leniently. With the same quality of work, I could only receive 5/6/6/6 in lang assignments (5/7 in content). But in this course, they gave me nearly full score. I guess they give you credits as long as you write something make sense based on the concepts taught and clearly present your logic. 1000 words should be good enough for a thorough discussion.",
            "comment_workload": "Make sure you read through (or at least glance through) the slides and textbook before lecture lest you will be like a fool sitting at the lecture theatre. Also, be on time every lecture because some important information (like tips for assignments) will be announced at the beginning of lecture. Some prs questions are also done right after the lecture begins. I remember once some students were 5-10 mins late &amp; they already lose all the credits for that prs session. <br /><br />For the case study assignments, as long as you understand the questions well and spot out the key points in the reading materials, you will be fine. Don’t be deadline fighter if you want your life easier. If you start early, you still have chance to discuss the questions with Ronald or your classmates to clarify your confusion, producing higher quality of work. <br /><br />For the final exam, some of my classmates thought it should be easy (the exam is open book &amp; all questions are MCQs), so they didn’t devote much effort studying the textbook. You will definitely run out of time (you only have 2 mins per question) if you struggle to flip over the textbook for every question. Also, in order to differentiate between A/A- &amp; B+ students, Ronald includes plenty of tricky questions (around 6-8). You can’t even search for answers from the textbook as they are like “common sense” (although some are counter-intuitive). But as long as you understand every single word in the textbook and jot down some supplementary notes from the slides, you are guaranteed &gt;80% of correctness. To get an A/A-, it depends on your level of understanding and some luck.<br /><br />After all, this is a worth taking cc for students wanting to avoid group project and get their GPA pulled up within two-week time.",

You would definitely be amazed by the innovative green technology. The&nbsp;&nbsp;profit-making and the green element can be actually mutaully inclusive (win-win!). It is also interesting to know the outsourcing strategy and the difference between ODM OEM and OBM. You can apply this concept when analysing in the stock market (eg AMD QCOM TSM INTC).",

You would definitely not get bored durinng the lecture( though I usually adjust the video speed to 2.5x). During the In-class exercises, he would explain the misconception/mistakes we made for each option. I could say he is very patient and responsable.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I found that the teaching sometimes could be biased. For example, professor would tell you the greatness of Chinese innovation, One Belt One Road, and Greater Bays Area. But he would never tell you the counterarguments and the potential crisis/concerns regarding those topics. From my overall impression, professor delivered in this way because of the restrictions from the department and HKUST. So I believe he could not say much about them. But please always bear in mind to have a critical thinking. Otherwise, it can be very dangerous. But anyway, I believe it is sometimes beneficial to hear opinions from different perspectives.",

I personally wrote around 2.5~3 pages for each one, which includes the content from the material given on Canvas AND some online content(your own research).<br /><br />My tip for the in-class exercise is to discuss with your friends and make sure you understand everything in the last lecture. Some students may suffer from careless mistakes. But since only 8 out of 10 are counted, I think getting 19 20 shouldn’t be difficult as the question is bery straight-forward.<br /><br />Overall grading: <br />(From Canvas)<br />* 85+ for A-, A, A+ grades (~23%)<br />* 75-84.9 for B-, B, B+ grades (~38%)<br />* 65-74.9 for C-, C, C+ grades (~27%)<br />* 55-64.9 for  D grade<br />* Less than 55 for F grade<br /><br />I would say the grading is very generous especially in class with 1000- level and 200 students.",
