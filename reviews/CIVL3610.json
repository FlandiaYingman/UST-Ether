Out of the 10 tutorials given, only 5 were marked (only revealed upon release). Out of those marked, the best 3 were chosen to compute the grade. Considering the amount of leniency given, the professor made it clear that students normally would get full marks in this section.<br /><br />[Midterm Exam (40%)]<br />An open-book exam held during lecture time, consisting of calculation questions that cover Chapters 1-3. The questions were quite in-depth and aim to test your understanding rather than memory. If you are familiar with the concepts, you could easily finish this paper with time to spare.<br /><br />[Final Exam (40%)]<br />A 2.5-hr open-book exam with True/False questions covering all of the course content and calculation questions (similar in design to the midterm) covering only Chapter 4.

            "comment_content": "This is the first review for this course and I better give you all the details of the course content. <br /><br />This course has a co-requisite CIVL 2170 but indeed it only covers very minimal topics, so Year 2 students can actually take this course earlier if they wish, this course is comparatively easier than those 2000-level courses. <br /><br />1. Introduction to traffic and transportation engineering<br /><br />An introductory chapter not tested in exams, but it helps us know different sub-topics of traffic and transportation engineering, the relevant technologies and methodologies evolved in solving transport problems. <br /><br />2. Traffic Flow Fundamentals <br /><br />Start with all different basic terminologies of traffic flow, like speed, density, capacity, gap, spacing, headway, occupancy. Then apply the linear and non-linear flow model to identify the changes between capacity, speed and density. Shock waves are then introduced to see the effects when traffic is slowed down due to low speed of front car in a single-lane road/ red-light, identify the relevant rate of growth of platoon and dissipation time etc. <br />Then a major topic is the Level of Service to identify the necessary design of a road to accommodate the traffic in peak hour and off-peak hour with the consideration of several factors(terrain, vehicle type etc), make suitable design and analysis. <br /><br />3. Geometric Design of Highways<br />The vertical and horizontal alignment of highway to determine the stationing, elevation, grades, obstruction, curvature etc with introduction of the alignment model, determine the shortest sight distance for sag and crest vertical curve, horizontal curve identify the design speed etc. <br /><br />4. Transportation Planning<br />A typical 4-steps modelling approach is introduced.<br />Trip Generation (how trips are generated from one zone due to several socio-economic factors)<br />apply linear regression to find the respective target year demand, conduct t-test to identify the goodness of fit. (Recall knowledge from CIVL 2160)<br />Cross-categories analysis<br /><br />Trip Distribution (how trips are produced and attracted to different zones with consideration of the distribution due to social-economic factors, impedence etc), <br />construction a origin-destination matrix, conduct calibration work. <br /><br />Model Choice <br />(how people choose the way of transportation, like transit or automobile, probability calculation)<br />Use Logit model,utility function(represent the benefits with consideration of different factors and present as a linear regression equation) to identify the model choice(probability) <br />Limitation of the model(IIA property)<br /><br />Trip Assignment (how trips are assigned onto roads with demand and supply principles, all-or-nothing assignment, shortest path problem, BLT functions) <br />Shortest Path Problem please refer to CIVL 2170. <br />User-equilibrium and system-optimum principles are addressed to identify the cost and demand of each path.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is responsible teaching the course given he understands students doubts in some of the sub-topics, he tries to demonstrate the concepts with clear and detailed examples apart from just presenting the equations. He also pays attention on addressing the qualitative concepts and understanding of some topics even they are not tested in exams. <br /><br />The only thing bad is Prof' accent, which can be hard to understand in the first few lectures, he may suddenly speak too fast and too loud with exaggeration sometimes. Once you get used to it, then that's not a big issue since he explains quite well with some hand-written notes on his slides. <br /><br />The topics overall are interesting and not hard, just in case if you want to learn deeper in this field, take CIVL 4620, PG Transportation courses or take some relevant elective courses during exchange after taking this course.",
            "comment_grading": "The exams are almost based on your efforts in understanding the lecture content and easy to handle if you revise, the grading should not be bad if you pay some efforts.<br /><br />Indeed the professor holds revision class before exams and even provides some tips for the final exam to save revision time, a really nice guy and nice topic.<br /><br />Grading: <br />HW 10% <br />Tutorial Quiz 10%<br />Midterm(ch 2, ch 3) 30%<br />Final (non-linear flow model, ch 4) 50% <br /><br />For Homework and Quizzes, most students get full mark, quizzes are graded base on efforts. HW just refer to sources (same as previous years), but still probably handle easily without sources.<br /><br />Personal Grading:<br />Quiz 10/10<br />HW 10/10<br />Midterm 82/100 (Mean 67)<br />Final 81/100 (Mean 73)<br />Overall: 85.1% <br />Grade: A-<br />To get A or above, I think you need to get higher score in final ~90 marks due to higher mean and higher proportion. The course is relatively competitive, a slight difference of the exam marks may cause you a sub-grade down.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is reasonable. <br /><br />Weekly tutorial quizzes with some review of the lecture topics covered and work on some simple problems, which is good for understanding the essential applications. <br /><br />6 HWs are assigned this semester, some of them are similar to the lecture notes problems, and some may need the aid of Excel for linear regression, plotting etc. Actually not difficult. <br /><br />Do some regular review of the content and work on the self-practice given by the professor then you will be fine with the exams. Just be careful with the equations and terminologies since they may be too much at first glance, but indeed they are not difficult to apply, just some simple maths and differentiation, and play with plugging numbers and equations. <br /><br />The lecture and tutorial notes are sufficiently enough for learning, the homework, quiz and self practice problems help effective understanding. In case you want to know more, refer to some reference textbooks.",

            "comment_teaching": "Hong Lo really has passion on transport engineering and also on his teaching. However, his tone was quite plain and the lectures were boring. <br /><br />For tutorial classes, nothing new had been taught. TAs were just repeating the content which is distributed during lectures, but if you skipped the lectures (which is normal as it is real boring and less than half of the class had really attended), be sure to attend the tutorial class on time as it will really save your quizzes.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is fair I would say even though I received an A in this course. The weighing is as shown:<br /><br />Tutorial Assignments (mini quizzes) (best 3) : 20%<br />Midterm Exam: 40%<br />Final Exam: 40%<br />(Exams were open-book so no memorizing)<br /><br />I was getting 9/10 on average in the 'tutorial assignments' part, 76/90 on Midterm exam, 111/120 on Final exam, and resulted in getting A (overall 88.8). <br /><br />If the exams will still be holding online next year, print out all the notes, highlight all the equation, and memorize where the equations are located, and it will do. <br /><br />But still, this course is compulsory, so don't think too much, you have to take this course anyway even if it is poorly graded.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is the least among all compulsory CIVL courses you have to take in year 3 spring. No HW, no project, no in-class question for checking your attendance during lectures. So technically you have to only attend 3 tutorials, midterm and final exam to get an A+.",
