        "description": "Coxeter systems and their associated lwahori-Hecke algebras are central to a lot active research at the intersection of combinatorics, geometry and representation theory. The goal of this course is to introduce the basic theory of these objects, highlight some interesting applications, and discuss current open problems. The prerequisites for the course are some familiarity with abstract algebra (specifically, representations of finite groups) and basic combinatorics. The first part of the course will focus on the preliminary theory, starting with root systems and finite Coxeter groups, working towards the classification of finite reflection groups, and then discussing the construction of the lwahori-Hecke algebra. The second part will survey applications and open problems, as time permits. Students without course prerequisite should seek approval from the instructor to take the course.",
