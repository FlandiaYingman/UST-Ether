Specific topics include advanced linear algebra such as orthogonal projections and vector and matrix norms; the theories and computations of matrix factorizations such as QR decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Schur decomposition; and applications to data analysis problems such as principle component analysis via SVD and collaborative filtering via matrix completion.",

            "comment_teaching": "I did not find Professor Cai's teaching very intuitive. It was not my cup of tea. I usually have the plain Tea or a HK-style milk tea from McDonald's. But this cup of tea was perhaps hand-made by crushing the dead tree leaves found near the campus. <br /><br />My main confusions lied in algorithms. Every single topic has an algorithm with it. I had not taken any courses on algorithms. <br /><br />One of the assignment questions was to evaluate time complexity or whatever, but we didn't learn anything related to that very thoroughly! (What we had to do is use the T(n) recurrence thing and solve it which I know now after taking COMP3711) I thought it was a bit ridiculous that an algorithms course was not a pre-requisite to this course because so many instances, it was just about algorithms. <br /><br />I do appreciate the professor's willingness to answer questions during lecture though and he seemed like an smiley dude. He would also draw diagrams at certain points which increased my intuition. <br /><br />I think teaching needs to be dumbed down further because not everybody has a solid foundation of linear algebra or algorithms. At least, I feel like he should tell us which knowledge is new and which is already learnt before. Intentional and clear transitions between topics did not exist.

He will give you some tricks on remembering the algorithms, and mainly focus on the contents that would be tested in final.<br /><br />I remember there existed one algorithm involving Givens matrix in final exam, which was easy to be confused with a normal algorithm.

Trying to find a classmate doing HW with you is really helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In each assignment, he asked you to finish lots of MATH problems such as SPD, block matrix.

I mean, as a 3000-level math course, the content doesn't ask you to think in yourself but keeps memorizing things. <br /><br />Also, the algorithm is not that useful as well, since there have already been a lot of easy-to-use toolkits and resources for matrix computation like numpy in python. However, there would be 1 question for matlab in each assignment, which was dumb too. (The algorithm is stated in the course material, you just need to copy and paste...)

Professor would not explain those algorithm preliminaries in details as he might think that we have already known them. It is easier for you to finish the homework with those knowledge as some homeworks require you to give out algorithms in specific time complexity (e.g. O(n^2) ).",
            "comment_teaching": "I personally think that Professor CAI has delivered a good teaching pace and style throughout this virtual semester. Some students may not like his relatively stronger accent, but I can really tell that he has a lot to teach us and he is working hard to do so (unfortunately he cannot cover the algorithm of SVD and its case study). <br /><br />For case studies, I actually like them very much since they are all about the practical application of these not-good-looking algorithms. You would not feel that what you learned in this course are just textbook knowledge irrelevant to real life.<br /><br />Conclusion: Never judge a professor by his/her accent first.",

TA would give out a MATLAB manual on Canvas without explicitly teaching it. One may say the heaviest workload lies in understanding the MATLAB syntax (then you will know how light the workload is).<br /><br />For final preparation, professor gave out a sample final before real final this semester. They are very similar and you can assure around 60-70 points if you completely understand the sample final.",
