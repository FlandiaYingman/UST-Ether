It is unnecessary but good for your understanding because sometimes he didn't clearly explain terms on the slides. <br /><br />1. Introduction of B2B Markets &amp; Marketing<br />2. Buyer Behavior<br />3. Inter-Firm Relationships &amp; Networks<br />4. Responsible B2B Strategy<br />5. Researching B2B Markets<br />6. Business Market Segmentation<br />7. Market Communication<br />8. Relationship Communication<br />9. Relationship Portfolios &amp; Key Acct. Mgmt.<br />10. Pricing for B2B Markets<br /><br />- There were two guest speakers who were industry professionals. <br />- Gene told about MikesBikes strategies but I think it is more useful to read through the whole student manual by yourself.",

Still only got B+ for the final grade.",

My group spent a lot of time for meetings (2-3 hours per time, 3 times a week), which was no efficient and spent a lot of time arguing. I heard some groups spent 30 min to 1 hour on average and still achieve great results.<br />The final report will be based on your thought and learning of the stimulation. It wouldn't take much time. <br /><br />Quizzes were easy. You just have to focus on what he said (examples and videos during the lectures) instead of the slides and textbooks.",

He makes jokes and gives good examples-- in my opinion, one of the better profs in SBM, but depends on your style. Not all explanations are super clear.",

The thing that takes the most time would be the game, since your group has to meet pretty often to discuss actions for the next round. Other than that, you only need 2-3 days before midterm/final to study, and there's no presentation so pretty chill. However, since Gene cares about participation, you gotta attend lectures (I skipped maybe 5 in the semester and got full marks for participation, so on the ones you do attend make sure to speak up once and he'll remember you).",
