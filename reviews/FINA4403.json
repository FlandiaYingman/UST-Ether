            "comment_content": "Started with the basics of international finance: exchange rate quotations, spot market vs forward market, various international parity relationships, etc. Midterm exam focuses more on these theories.<br /><br />After midterm, more applications will be covered: balance of payment analysis, currency derivatives and related risk management strategies, as well as international portfolio evaluation.<br /><br />The professor analysed the international investment strategies from the viewpoints of a hedger and a speculator. I think the professor strikes a balance between theory and practice quite well.",
            "comment_teaching": "The best FINA professor I have met. A lot of interactions with the class, stimulating our interests on the topics. He also had a clear logic flow guiding us through the course, emphasizing on intuition rather than mathematics. Very often he urged the class to apply the intuition in everyday investment scenarios, and he provided a lot of real life cases for illustration. Sometimes he might dismiss the class a bit early, but he always stayed behind for questions, sometimes for 15+ minutes.<br /><br />Lecture slides are also very detailed, though a bit wordy. The professor provided a lot of background information about various investment strategies, but they are not tested in assessments. Although attendance is not counted for most lessons (except presentation days), attending lessons will definitely help you to understand course materials thoroughly. It saves a lot of time for revision.",

Also got an average of 85.5/100 in group assignments and 100/100 for case study, and final course grade is B+. The grading is fair - at least not as harsh as typical FINA courses. I believe the professor gives a lot of B+ and not too many A range grades though.",
            "comment_workload": "Definitely heavier than most of the other FINA courses, but still manageable. Assignments are very long and sometimes involve Excel (e.g. some regression analyses), but they are done in groups of 3 to 4. <br /><br />Case study is done after midterm, combining 2 assignment groups. Although topics for each group varies, all of them require thorough understanding and application of different concepts covered in the course. Some topics even require complicated statistical analyses, but guidance from the professor is sufficient. Having good group mates is very important in these two grading elements.<br /><br />For this semester, only 2 optional exercises were provided right before final exam. They are very useful for revision and some final exam questions are just copied from OE. Make sure you complete them.<br /><br />Going through lecture slides is actually not a heavy workload should you attend classes and understand the professor's logic flow. However, each exam consists of one question requiring you to prove some simple investment theories. Don't omit them in revision.",

International Parity Relationships, Exchange Rate Determination and Forecasting<br />4. Balance of Payments<br />5. Currency Derivatives<br />6. Managing Foreign Exchange Risks<br />7. International Investment<br />Topics before mid-term are quite easy. Only involves currency conversion, parity relation, such as IRP, PPP, Fisher effect, balance of payment and how to use these relations to forecast future spot rate. For this semester, Prof. Li added a new special topic called currency investment strategies. I personally think this is the most difficult topic among other topics. <br />After mid-term, we then jumped to currency derivative instruments and used them to hedge different foreign exchange rate risks. These involve some simple calculation but I don't think it is that difficult compared with other FINA courses. There is another special topic after mid-term called speculation with currency derivative, just a simple short call/put option strategy to enhance company revenue.<br /><br />Generally, I think this is a must-take course for FINA student, especially if you want to work in FX and rate desks.
