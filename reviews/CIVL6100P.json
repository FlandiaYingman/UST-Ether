        "description": "This course offers a general overview of the structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies. The course structure contains three parts: the first part presents various non-destructive evaluation (NDT) technologies for detecting damage at material (local structural) level, including wave-based methods, thermographic inspection, etc; the second part introduces vibration based SHM and system identification, which uses acceleration to access the structural condition; the third part introduces the fundamentals and applications of fiber optic sensing technologies in infrastructure sensing and SHM. This course equips the students with both the fundamental knowledge and the cutting-edge applications of structural sensing and health monitoring technologies. Instructor's approval is required.",
