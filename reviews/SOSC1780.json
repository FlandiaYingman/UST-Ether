There are a lot of numbers/ figures in his notes and he would explain the meaning behind, be sure to mark them down.

I attend every class when many students actually not, but I get below mean two times as my format of assignment do not meet his demand. BUT the problem is only the format!!!!! I actually already tried to make my assignment meet his demand very hard. I tried my best to do them but get these results!!!!!! I cannot believe that. And my final grade is also bad as I didn't review who creates those theories.<br />And you should not missed any class or you should have a friend in the class if you don't want to come. That's because he will take quiz randomly and the quiz need assess code to unlock it.<br />I finally got C- .",

But it's difficult to get good grade in assignments as the main part of assignments is easy to finish but once you make some mistakes in details, you might lose the chance to get a good grade. For these assignments, you just need to review the slides and do some easy counts.",

If you listen carefully, you will be able to answer them.<br />The two assignments consist of calculation questions and short answer questions, and you need to use Word to create statistical charts, which are similar to the problem sets in the Business School (I am from the School of Engineering).<br /><br />During the last class, Professor Ma will discuss the exam points for the final exam, so it is important to take notes and review them.<br />However, I memorized all of the lecture notes, including the various charts and data, and did well on the final exam. Therefore, memorizing more will earn you more points, and if you memorize enough, you will get a good grade.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, the content of the lecture notes was covered in the final exam, and the short essay questions were quite objective. Simply reiterating the theoretical content from the PPT is enough, and there is no need to write a lot of your own thoughts.<br /><br />I did not feel that there was any fierce competition with students from SHSS, it's not that hard :)<br /><br />====================================<br /><br />还是很轻松的，上课需要参与课堂讨论，zoom时期就是统计发言次数，跟着其他同学一起复读答案就可以。<br /><br />Quiz是单选题，上课看视频，回答几个视频中提到答案的问题，基本上听了就会做。<br /><br />两个assignment都是计算题和简答题，需要拿word做统计图，和商院那些problem set有点像（我本人是工院的）。<br /><br />最后一节课马老师会讲期末考试的考点，都记下来复习就行。<br /><br />但我背下了所有的lecture notes，包括里面的各种图表和数据，期末考试直接嘎嘎乱杀。所以背多分、背背佳，背了分就多，背了成绩就好。<br /><br />我个人感觉期末考试lecture notes上的内容都被考到了，Short Essay问题其实挺客观的，复述一下PPT里讲得理论就行，不需要写很多自己的想法。<br /><br />也没觉得有什么文院大佬竞争内卷难，或者说他们也没能竞争过我:)",

Only the class with quiz counts attendance. The quizs are very easy with only 3 questions. Assignments are also easy with some calculations and explanation, mean was around 90. <br />Final was divided in 3 parts:<br />Calculation ----20 mins (one question)<br />MCs----40 mins (30 questions)<br />5-min Break <br />Short Essay ----- 75 mins&nbsp;&nbsp;(two questions)<br />I got 92 and 91 for the assignments, full mark in quizs, final was not shown. <br />Final grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "Very light workload with only some easy quizs and assignments. Final was easier than expected just MCs were tricky, requiring students to be very familiar with every points or data as those options. Final essay questions were just memorizing and applying those theories is ok to deal with. <br />As the topic is related to society, I don't think we need to memorize much things, using common sense to understand the materials is enough. <br />Overall it is not a hard course to study, I didn't study during the semester, pay attention on class and understand every points is enough. Final was like memorizing and reviewing. The most satisfying course ever !!!",
