In the first part, the fundamental of geotechnics will be introduced to students, including geotechnics and environment, physico-chemical soil behavior, and engineering considerations of geomaterials. The second part will focus on the engineering applications and considerations of environmental geotechnics, including ground rehabilitation and improvement, natural hazards due to earthquake, climate-changes induced slope instability issues, green slope technology, sustainable and environmental friendly underground infrastructures, and instrumentation, physical modeling, and advanced testing in environmental geotechnics.",
