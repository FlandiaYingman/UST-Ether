            "comment_teaching": "Nice overall. Content is not easy but his teaching is clear, largely following his notes and the textbook. I have some prior experience in Lie algebra but still found lectures worth going to, to clear up concepts.<br /><br />Might be good to spend less time reviewing things sometimes (as mentioned by pp), especially because the lecture itself is not very long.<br /><br />Towards the end of the term he is rushing through a lot of content in order to finish all topics, so I often had to go home and read the textbook afterwards in order to do the homework.",
            "comment_grading": "Don't know since grades are not out yet. But grades are 100% based on assignments. He can be pretty strict with grading homework (i.e. will catch all careless mistakes or occasional slips).",
            "comment_workload": "Quite heavy, assignments were weekly in the beginning but became biweekly later. 7 homework assignments in total, typically 10 questions per assignment. Some are not straightforward so it takes time to think.<br /><br />Deadlines are very flexible, which is good and bad- useful when you are busy, but also led to many people (myself included) putting off homework until the last day humanly possible. Most people email him for a deadline extension. (I don't think anyone submitted the last assignment on time at the first due date, and not all submitted at the extended deadline.)",

            "comment_content": "Official textbook: Introduction to Lie Algebra and Representation Theory, Humphreys. This is a short, concise but meanwhile old, unfriendly textbook for me (Perhaps this is due to my lack of experience in learning algebra). <br /><br />Some comments:<br /><br />-&gt; I am learning (instead of learnt) MATH3131 in the same semester, so I sometimes feel confused mainly in the first half of the course. Some basic terms like centralizer, ideal, module are core concepts. If you have similar background like me when taking this course, do review frequently when encountering unfamiliar concepts. <br />-&gt; Try to find some connection between Lie algebra theory and other fields, like geometry (tangent space of Lie group at identity) and quantum mechanics (Angular momentum/spin operator). For me, finding relation between various field is quite enjoyable. Some related textbook are as follows:<br /><br />1. An introduction to Manifolds, Loring Tu<br />2. Quantum theory for Mathematicians, B.C. Hall<br /><br />-&gt; I guess the main purposes of this course are as follows:<br /><br />1. Study semisimple Lie algebra by various kinds of decomposition (Jordan decomposition/root space decomposition/weight space decomposition). <br />2. Study the classical types of Lie algebras A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n",
            "comment_teaching": "Some good points:<br /><br />1. The instructor always do review of previous material at the beginning of each lecture. This is good for getting on the right track.<br /><br />2. Fast teaching: The teaching pace is so fast that almost every topics in the main textbook are covered. <br /><br />Points for improvement:<br /><br />1. Too much time for reviewing: The instructor usually spends 15-30 minutes to review material, so the real teaching time for new material may be around an hour only. <br /><br />2. The cost of doing review and fast-paced teaching is to sacrifice the detail of important proofs. This happens frequently near the end of semester.",
            "comment_grading": "Purely from homework. I guess for algebra topics, examination is not suitable as a part of grading.",
            "comment_workload": "Seven homework in this semester, 2 homework sets fewer than the last year. Comparing with this semester's MATH3131 (same number of problem sets, slightly more questions), the homework difficulty for this course is much higher since they are much more complicated. <br /><br />One inhumane thing is the on-paper submission policy of homework - Even Yan Min does not do this in his topology course this semester.",
