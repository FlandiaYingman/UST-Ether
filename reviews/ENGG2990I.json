        "description": "This course is designed to give 1st year engineering students exposure to different engineering disciplines through designing and building a remote controlled airship. Specifically, they will build an airship that uses helium balloons for lift, has motors and propellers for propulsion and control, and is controlled remotely using an Android device. Students will first acquire the basic knowledge and skills through online learning in the first part of the course. In the second part of the course, students will meet face-to-face and be divided into design teams with a common goal: construct an airship and participate in a competition at the end of the term. For Year 1 Engineering students only.",
