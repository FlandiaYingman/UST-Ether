        "name": "The Economic and Political Development of Modern Japan, 1603-1905",
        "description": "The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). It emphasizes the contribution of Japan's indigenous market economy and state-building efforts to Japan's transformation. We will cover topics such as rural commercialization and the rise of entrepreneurship; the business ethics of Tokugawa merchants and its contribution to a market economy; the spread of mass education and its significance to political participation; and the mercantile economic policies of major domain governments as well as the shogunate's economic policy-making. We will also underscore the role of politics, examining how domestic politics impacted the process of learning from the west and how the struggle for a political system with more representation shaped the process of modernization. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan. It provides a more nuanced picture of its modernization, as well as highlight the multiple trajectories of development that were possible in Japan. Moreover, it will help them better understand the relationship between economic development and political participation through a concrete case-study, and allow us to rethink critically existing models of development.",
