        "description": "This course examines the development of capitalism in post-Mao China through the lens of comparisons with capitalist practices in pre-1949 China and non-PRC Chinese economies and with select capitalist systems elsewhere. Through reading and discussing scholarly works focusing on contractual governance, students will be guided to explore the forces that shape the evolution of internal organization, inter-firm interactions, and business-government relations in different historical and social contexts. The objective is to help students deepen their understanding of China's economic transformation and broaden their perspectives on capitalist economic organizations and institutions.",
