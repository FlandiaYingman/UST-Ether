            "comment_teaching": "I got a lot to say about his teaching, but if I have to make it short, - He is the worst lecturer that I have encountered throughout my 4 years life here in HKUST. <br />照PowerPoint讀都算，讀到佢咁真係Speechless – 所以自己睇都快過佢讀<br /><br />It is very common for some lecturers repeating the words on the PowerPoint, but he even got difficulties just to repeat the words. He would have a lot of fillers within one sentence. In other words, he includes meaningless words and phrases like eh, um, uh, ok, u know, alright, and much more in just one simple sentence. You have to make extra effort to filter what he has been saying while receiving a very low level of information, this makes me so frustrated every lesson. Not to mention, he stutters between words as well. Reading the PowerPoint and textbook on your own would even have a smoother and effective learning process. <br /><br />When he prepared some textbook's questions and discussed in class, he would display the official answer, not allowing any photo-takings (which is still acceptable) and reminding us that he did not like the answer as it was not specific enough to score full marks in his exams. But he never explains clearly how specific he wanted, he should try demonstrating or typing out his ideal answer on his PowerPoint if he has difficulty to explain verbally. <br /><br /><br />When he was trying to explain a particular slide, he would say a lot “this this that that” with his fingers pointing to the slides, you have to pay attention to what “this” and “that” refer to. And when revealing the answer of true or false questions, he would just “explain” it by saying “it’s true as it’s just the same as what I have just said.” Or “ it’s false as it’s opposed to what I have just said.” At the end he would say “I hope you gain more understanding by this.” How funny.",
            "comment_grading": "The arrangement for the final is world-class. Complicated, troublesome and meaningless. The time given for each part was very insufficient. And we still have to manage to scan and upload the doc to canvas and email 3 times for a final. I'm sorry but I have been cursing throughout the whole final. Not looking forward for my final grading.",
            "comment_workload": "And never reg his 0900 lesson if you are not confident enough to sit in the classroom and be ready at 9am sharp. He does not allow attending other sessions. He would start the lesson and most importantly the iPRS right away. While best 5 out of 6 iPRS are calculated towards your final grade, being late and missing out any questions do you no good. While people were still rushing into the classroom, he would just say “Ok, all ready, let’s start!”. God apparently a lot of us were not! (What makes you think we’re all ready?! Ok, just remember good students should arrive punctually.) We are required to answer the 5-6 questions a time with ard 1-2min per question. Those questions are from Ppt/textbooks. <br /><br />Oh and on the day we got an online quiz at night, many of us did not expect a 0900 iPrs, but yes he still had an iPRS for us 0900 sharp. How exciting. Btw he asked if the iPRS was fun after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thinks he is funny and humorous, but NOT. AT. ALL. <br /><br />What makes me so confusing and speechless is about the assignment. We had to hand in a mini case assignment. Hand-written (understandable), but the reason why he required us to do a hand-written one was that he nearly forgot how to write, so he had to train us.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we had to hand in a digital copy. He asked us to write it out, scan and submit back to canvas. To be honest, there’s nothing wrong and it’s workable, but it’s just that what’s the point of doing so?<br /><br />When he was explaining a mcq in class, he would say answer B and C is wrong, then the answer would be A. But he did not explain why not answer D. He is so weird, and I don’t get his logic at most times. <br />It’s so sad that all the sessions are taught by him in this semester, and this is a compulsory course. So, just grin and bear it. But if a 4% iPRS (scoring full mark) does not convince you to be in class, it’s alright to run away from the lecture. <br /><br />We got iPRS, quiz, case assignments, midterms, projects and presentations, but final still accounts for 50%(before the rearrangement).

David will assign a specific scenario for each same numbered group from different sections and then we present the topic during class time. So Group 1 from L1, 2, 3 will present the same topic. David will record the presentations and then chooses the best presentation from the 3 and put the video of those presentations on YouTube for us to watch. Afterwards, we are to complete MCQs designed by the featured presentation groups, which accounts for another 5%; however, David found that many of the MCQs designed were problematic, so he abandoned the MCQs. That 5% is accounted for somewhere else (I'm not sure where...)<br />10% is for in-class video quiz. Basically, we watch 2 videos in class, and answer MCQs based on the videos; very easy and straightforward. But due to some reason, David cannot finish the lectures on time, so 1 video was cancelled, so that 5% is gone somewhere as well...<br />20% for closed book midterm. Just memorize as much as you can.<br />55% for open book final. Non-cumulative, and the format is like the discussion questions and QP in class. So print out notes and label them carefully. A lot of writing is needed and time is tight.",

Just need to be creative and have a sense of humor to make the presentation less boring, and you will be fine.<br />A lot of memorizing for the midterm though, so that could be quite exhausting, but final is open book.
