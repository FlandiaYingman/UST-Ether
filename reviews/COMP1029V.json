        "description": "This course introduces the VBA programming language, in the context of Microsoft Excel. It is intended for students who already have some experience in computer programming but wish to learn how to apply those programming skills to VBA, within Excel. The course covers basic programming topics, such as variables, functions and loops, to more advanced topics. Appropriate features of the Excel program are also covered. Students explore these by self-learning of course materials together with guided programming exercises. Students without the prerequisites but possess relevant programming knowledge may seek instructor's approval for enrolling in the course. Graded P or F.",

There are 20 exercises in total in the paper, with lots of small blanks. It's extremely difficult for you to finish them within one hour. Therefore, you should get good scores in the straight forward questions or you will possibly fail the course. <br />I didn't learn those basic knowledge about VBA well, so I got great panic during the exam .Even though I got A in COMP1021, due to the great panic, I almost finished nothing about the logic-required part of the exam. And due to my weak master of the basic knowledge, I almost fail the course.<br />My advice is: don't be fooled by ustspace, you need to learn that seriously or you will fail!!",
