            "comment_content": "It teaches about different topics under services marketing and there is a strong emphasis on the GAPS model, i.e gaps from the provider while providing a service and customer gap. It's pretty bullshit in my opinion.<br /><br />IF you see this professor next semester, I'd advice you not to take it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This course despite what the prof conveys, is all about memorization. <br /><br />The components are: <br />2 midterm exams<br />Participation/ Attendance<br />Presentation <br />Report<br />Marketing Experiments",
            "comment_teaching": "The prof name is Qiang Zhang and he is a new professor, fresh out of PhD and has limited teaching experience in NTU, if I am not wrong. <br /><br />His teaching is quite mediocre, speaks with a thick Mainland accent and delivery poor. His voice may make you feel disinterested and use your phone or laptop to pass time. I would say he is quite committed in the sense that he would send regular mails on what would be covered in the next class and immediately reply to mails regarding any questions about the course. <br /><br />The regular mails started to get annoying tho after sometime. The analogies he comes up with while teaching are quite senseless and irritating at worst.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading fucking sucks. The exams are a mix of short answers and MCQs, so the short answers can be answered in a variety of ways, yet the professor grades according to what he thinks is 'right' and claims that it follows the service marketing principles. <br /><br />A lot of people had issues with how he graded it and were trying to get extra points by justifying their answers. <br /><br />The other components such as the presentation, report and participation, I am not too sure as he didn't release the grades for those, but I think most people may have got similar scores.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is OK. Not high, but not low. You are expected to read a case every week as he would go through the case in class and you'll need to answer questions on a worksheet which will be distributed in class. <br /><br />It's good to read the cases in advance and pay attention to them so that you can answer some of the questions in the exam as they are tested. <br /><br />The project will take some to complete and better to start early before you get busy with other courses. It is a service audit where you select a company and investigate the services they are providing and try to find out what gaps exist in their service. <br /><br />This project will involve primary and secondary research, finding information online about the company, conducting interviews with customers, focus groups, interviewing the staff/ managers, and observing the place where the service takes place. You'll need to apply the concepts learnt in class to support research and finally present your findings in a in class presentation and a report.",
