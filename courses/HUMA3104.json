New chords are introduced each week and at the end of the course modulation is also introduced. This is the first time this course has been taught at UST so there was definitely an experimental element in terms of what to cover.<br /><br />You need HUMA2104/equivalent background (ie G5 theory) to take the course (you have to pass a placement exam in the first class), and it's vvv useful to know how to play the piano, since you will be writing music in some form for the next 13 weeks.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Kaila is a great teacher. He really tries to engage everyone despite the time of day, and his explanations are very clear- the class is definitely enjoyable. Galison, who is also a composer, takes the tutorials and he does mainly ear training- he's good fun as well<br /><br />There is always a lot of feedback on all your homework, so you always know where you went wrong and how you can improve. Both of them were also happy to answer questions, whether in person or through email.",

            "comment_content": "This course mainly focuses on two main parts: renaissance species counterpoints and voice leading (SATB harmonize). The species counterpoints will be introduced in the first few weeks after the introduction of the cantus firmus. Students should be able to follow the melodic rules in writing species counterpoints. In the middle of the course, new tonal functional chords will be introduced to students in every lecture, and voice leading should be based on some rules in species counterpoints.<br /><br />It is strongly recommended NOT to enroll in this course unless you have an equivalent background of HUMA2104 or Grade 8 Music Theory. You will find this course very difficult to follow if you are not proficient in cadences, chord notations and key signatures. However, you should pass the placement test before entering the first lecture (simple Grade 5 Music Theory stuff). Knowing how to play the piano is a benefit for composing music.",
            "comment_teaching": "Both prof Kaila and Galison are good teachers, who put passionate in teaching. Prof Kaila is a well-known composer who always interacts with students during the lectures, ensuring everyone can follow his teaching pace. Galison is also a great composer who does ear training during the tutorial sections. During tutorial sections, he sometimes tells us to sing Palestrina's Sicut Cervus and plays Kahoot, which is really fun.<br /><br />Both of them are very happy to answer your questions, best teachers I've met so far in UST.",

There's no right or wrong in the assignment, if you finish on time, you'll receive detailed feedback and a &quot;complete&quot; grade. However, they always upload the homework on the day straight you have to hand in (i.e less than 12hrs to do), which is a bit weary.",
