        "description": "The course focuses on developing students' ability to communicate mathematical knowledge to the general public through effective writing and speaking skills. In writing, students learn the specific skills to produce genres of both expository and persuasive nature, and reflect on how to explain mathematics concepts in an accessible manner without losing the scientific complexity. In speaking, students learn how to communicate mathematics notions and implications to nonexpert audiences using short videos and oral presentations with appropriate rhetorical and stylistic devices. For MATH and DSCT students only.",

            "comment_content": "This is a new course replacing LANG 3011, however this is just another LANG course that has no particular purpose to the Mathematics students despite their best claim.<br /><br />This course is intended to teach us &quot;effective science communication&quot;, in which means &quot;don't talk any math that the audience don't know because they won't bother understand you anyway and getting your message through is more important than facts and science&quot;-kind of way.<br /><br />In general I think the ILOs is unclear and create confusion among students and instructors, as often the instructor gets frustrated for the confusing chapters that this course offers which provides definitive answers to general questions to public speech like what to act when the audience is not listening to you. I believe there are no definitive answer to such questions as there are no absolute and best answer for everyone. <br /><br />Such content, I believe won't enhance the generally unsatisfactory language performance in math students and this course just serves a 3 credit grade reaping course for me.<br /><br />There are 5 assignments.<br />1. 60-90 seconds short speaking task (compulsory, not graded) <br />It asks us to film ourselves about how and why we choose math, or why the world need more mathematicians.<br />But since it's not graded, so you got what I mean.<br /><br />2. SA1 2.5-3.5 mins video<br />Uses story-telling to introduce 4 chosen topics:<br />a. Inspire the viewer about the benefits of having an academic background in mathematics.<br />b. Inspire the viewer about the impact of mathematics in society.<br />c. Persuade the viewer that a certain area of mathematics is its most worthwhile sub-discipline.<br />d. Persuade the viewer that public understanding of mathematics benefits society (or culture or well-being).<br /><br />3. WA1 500-700 words pop science article<br />It is about how an idea is formed from a wide chosen range of topics by math profs<br /><br />4. SA2 in class 5-7mins Ted Talk<br />Give a controversy math idea to the public in Ted Talk style, with 3 mins of Q&amp;A session in addition.<br /><br />5. WA2 1000-1200 words Op-ed article on math controversy you covered in SA2.",
            "comment_teaching": "Carmel is awesome. She is talkative, and she brought the language class filled with all mathematics students with our noise. Cannot express how much energy you could feel she had in her mind, even when she is sick. She had the magical ability to make this math lang class the most talkative class in this semester for her.<br /><br />She also gave 2 personal evaluations for WA1, SA2+WA2 to each students. Although it's conducting in a group meeting, but she will ask every student individually and you may as well pick up ideas from others as well. Her hard-work to make our work more pleasant to her will not be forgotten as this greatly boost my confidence level in doing those 3 assignments.<br /><br />Lastly, let's talk about other instructor, in which I had swapped to Carmel class by luck from another tutor called Chong Siu Chung. His class is so boring and clearly unprepared that most of the time the class ends up in dead air. He just go through the textbook and read while Carmel has her own pptx which makes me admire her even more for her profession and shame to those who teach for their duties only. I am so lucky that I swapped from Chong's class to her class.<br /><br />If you are in Chong's class, please highly consider swapping if you can't endure dead-air happening 20+ times every lesson.<br />If you are in Carmel's class, please stay for all causes and let her help your GPA.",

(In class)<br />2nd Written Assessment (25%): An op-ed article on a Mathematics controversy, of length 1000-1200 words.<br />The remaining 10% is the participation marks.<br /><br />I personally got all scores above 5 with an average of 5.3, got a B.<br />The average mark should be around 4 or 4.5.<br />But knowing that students in other sessions mostly got an average of 6 or above and eventually got an A, Chung is not as lenient in giving grades as the other tutors. Since it's a level 3000 class, the grading should've been more lenient than the LANG 1002/1003 as Chung apparently follows the grading mechanics for those 1000 level courses.",
            "comment_workload": "It's quite tough to go to the lesson, especially it's a 9 am class and I live quite far away.<br />There are some assignments for us to top-up the participation mark, including a 1.5 minutes vlog about &quot;Why you choose Math as your major?&quot; or &quot;Does the world need more Mathematicians?&quot;, and also some discussions on Canvas, the workload for those was not too much.<br />To complete those assessments, one has to do a lot of researches well advance so that you are familiar with the topic if you are not very interested in Mathematics (I think most of the Math students are). One has to spend much more time on the researching than actually completing the assessments. If you're not quite familiar with the topics in your track, then you might be in trouble as those assessments require your in-depth understandings and your ability to re-phrase them into layman terms.",

But I have screwed up the second one because of writing something with the Axiom of Choice... <br /><br />Heard that he was a killer in terms of grading, let's see how my grade will go.<br /><br />Update: End up with B+, given I got 4-range in 2nd assignment, and 6 range for others.

But, maybe since this is related to what I am interested in (mathematics, obviously), I find it slightly more useful than others, still C is probably the best I can give for this category",

            "comment_workload": "The main workload is just to decide the topic, just try to work on something you already know what it is about and you should be good, as I said in the grading section, I spent less than a day on each of them",

You can watch youtube videos regarding your chosen topic to see how they explain the concepts to people without maths background :)",

            "comment_content": "As per the official description on Canvas: <br /><br />The course focuses on two overarching themes:<br /><br />1. Science communication and story-telling<br />You will gain an understanding of the importance of science communication and the role of story-telling therein, developing the skills to effectively analyze popular science articles and presentations aimed at the general public, as well as to use appropriate strategies to make your own science communication – writing and speaking – accessible and interesting to lay audiences.<br /><br />2. Communicating controversy in mathematics<br />You will gain an understanding of public attitudes to and controversies in mathematics and how such controversies are presented in speech and in writing, developing the skills to critically read and write about – as well as present – scientific controversies in an accessible and interesting way to lay audiences.<br /><br />The other two reviews are pretty critical of the course content but in my opinion, this course provides a decent opportunity to improve our written and spoken English. This course isn't gonna make you some Math communication prodigy but frankly, that's not the purpose. I believe it simply teaches us how to express Mathematics in a more accessible language. FYI you're not employing an academic style on this course. If you're gonna work in math-related fields, you'll need the skill to be able to explain complex math stuff properly to the lay audience. And the skill is obviously transferable so you can make use of it later on for other stuff. Being a good communicator takes a lot of work so this course is all about trying to improve yourself in that regard.",
            "comment_teaching": "There's not really much to say here. Because there isn't any of the typical teaching in LANG. The instructor does provide us with units and/or reference articles/videos but it's heavily based on discussions among your peers in breakout rooms. While this can be an excellent method to exchange opinions and improve your own speaking skills, you occasionally get those silent partners and it's basically you giving a monologue by yourself.<br /><br />Regardless, Miss. Clayton does provide us with some direction and you can consult her if you're stuck in your assignments. However, you're mostly responsible for the work so all she can help with are the minor details.<br /><br />FYI, there aren't any participation marks like in LANG2010 but any more than 3 absences will automatically lead to a fail.",
            "comment_grading": "We had 3 assessment tasks (all individual): (I've included descriptors as attachment for each of them)<br /><br />Written Assessment 1 : (25%)<br />Telling the Story of the Development of a Mathematics Idea.<br />A 600-700 words pop-sci style article intended for the educated general public. We can select topics like the Monty Hall problem, history of pi/e, prime numbers, etc. Our article must be framed after one of the story types:<br />-The story of how scientists’ understanding of a particular mathematics idea has developed.<br />-The story of how a mathematics breakthrough came about.<br />-The story of how a mathematics prize was won (e.g. Fields Medal).<br />-The story of how a mathematician got something wrong, and how they found a solution to this or moved forwards over time.<br />-The story of how society’s perception of or belief in a particular mathematics idea has changed over time.<br />-The story of how a breakthrough in mathematics has led to change or had impact in wider society.<br />-The story of how a finding in mathematics has led to progress in another science discipline.<br />-The story of how a particular sub-discipline of mathematics came about.<br />-The story of how a particular mathematics study or research project has influenced our understanding.<br /><br />The whole idea to be able to tell an interesting story that you believe is interesting to the general audience. See the attached file on descriptors for what the instructor expects out of you.<br /><br />Written Assessment 2: Op-ed Article on a Mathematics Controversy&nbsp;&nbsp;(40%)<br /><br />1000 to 1200 words op-ed article to persuade the audience&nbsp;&nbsp;(educated general public) of your opinion on a controversial mathematics issue or idea. Our article must be informative, engaging, and most importantly, persuasive. The controversy part can be somewhat confusing. To put it simply, it's referring to any idea/topic in mathematics is up for debate among mathematicians in terms of its interpretation, understanding and impacts. While there are many math-heavy topics like Has Mochizuki solved the ABC conjecture but it's probably a better idea to go with more 'socially controversial' topics like math education. My topic was whether we should make the math electives in high school mandatory.<br /><br /><br />Speaking Assessment 3: TED- style talk on a mathematics topic/idea (35%)<br /><br />A 5-7 min pre-recorded video submission of a TED-style presentation talk with slides on any general math topic to interest, engage and inform the educated general public.<br />Again, it's comparatively easier iThe format is more or less similar to any TED-talk you find on YouTube and you're expected to provide proper organized content while being engaging and persuasive with appropriate delivery. My topic was on&nbsp;&nbsp;' The Misuse of statistics' and I focused on how misrepresenting data/graphs can mislead an audience, what sort of implications they can have and what we can do to be a safe consumer of information..<br /><br /><br />Each assessment has 3 grading areas with a maximum score of 7 on each category. My scores are as follows:<br /><br />Writing Assessment 1 (25%)<br />Content and Organization-&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br />Style&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 6<br />Language&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 7<br /><br />Writing Assessment 2 (40%)<br />Content and Organization-&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br />Style&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 7<br />Language&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 7<br /><br />Speaking Assessment 3 (35%)<br />Content and Organization-&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br />Language and Style&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 5.5<br />Delivery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 7<br /><br />My weighted average in a single category is 6.34<br /><br />My grade was A+<br /><br />From my understanding, most students are in and around the&nbsp;&nbsp;5 range, but your class average is highly dependent on how many internationals/native speakers you land. However, I believe this course employs some form of absolute grading so don't be discouraged just because all your classmates are really fluent!",
            "comment_workload": "There are only 3 assignments in total. Deadlines are in week 6, week 10 and week 13. However, you need to spend a considerable amount of time to properly develop an idea and research the topic adequately so this might take more time than you think. Of course, you're free to do a deadline rush but that'll most likely end in failure. I spent lots of my free time thinking about what I could write/speak about and I set aside a&nbsp;&nbsp;couple of days to solely work on the LANG assignment. <br />You need some proper time-management skills otherwise the deadline days will be rather stressful.",
