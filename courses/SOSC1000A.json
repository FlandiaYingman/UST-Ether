Most of them are about economics, so you will feel familiar with those concepts if you have studied economics in high school or uni. <br />The first chapter is about demand and supply curve, which is exactly the same as high school curricular, but sadly she didn't put that into midterm:(<br />There are also many in class activities, most of them are interesting coz they make the lessons less boring.",

However, she does show all the steps of in class exercises clearly, so you just have to jot them down and study them, because they are included in the exams. The exam questions (long questions) are exactly the same as the in class exercise, so you don't have to worry about the calculation or plotting graphs. I strongly suggest you to pay attention when she is explaining the in class exercises, but other than that, you can just take a nap or watch youtube because you can still understand the lectures by going through the ppt for around 15mins after lessons lol.<br />The prof is also very nice, she answered all of my questions clearly and patiently, so don't be afraid to ask.
