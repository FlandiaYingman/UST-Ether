            "comment_content": "Very Good.<br /><br />The course is basically about structural modeling approach. A wide range of topics are covered: production &amp; cost function estimation, demand function estimation, merger analysis, entry &amp; exit, dynamic decision model, dynamic game with multiple agents, auction. <br /><br />You can find latest syllabus and course materials here: <br />https://kohei-kawaguchi.github.io/EmpiricalIO/",
            "comment_teaching": "Good.<br /><br />The professor is very passionate when teaching this course, much more energetic than when he is teaching Micro Theory. He is very responsive to questions and encourages in-class interactions.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is very generous. As long as you finished the assignments, A is ensured.<br /><br />The grading of each assignment is careful, as a minor bug in one of my assignments was pointed out by the professor in feedback.",
            "comment_workload": "Middle to Heavy.<br />If you are not familiar with R, the workload will be extremely heavy.<br /><br />Cited from the syllabus:<br />* Assignments (80): In total 8 homework are assigned. Each homework involves the implementation of the methods covered in the class. Each homework has 10 points. The working hour for each homework will be around 10-20 hours.<br />* Participation (10): Every time a participant asks a question in the class, a�er the class, during the o�ice hour, or in the canvas. the participant gets one point, up to 10 points. The participant who asked the question writes the name, ID number, his/her question, and my answer in a discussion board on the course website to claim a point.<br />* Referee report (10): Toward the end of the semester, a paper in industrial organization is randomly assigned to each participant. Each participant writes a critical referee report of the assigned paper in A4 2 pages that consists of the summary, contribution, strong and weak points of the paper.<br />* Grading is based on the absolute scores: A+ with more than 80 points, A with more than 70 points, A- with more than 60 points, B+ with more than 50 points, B with more than 40 points, B- with more than 30 points and C otherwise.",
