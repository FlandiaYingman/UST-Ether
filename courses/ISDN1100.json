        "description": "This course aims to cultivate students’ appreciation of design and sense of aesthetic sensibility. This raises students’ awareness of design to the visuals and beauty of surroundings and equally important, solving everyday problems in an aesthetic way.  Furthermore, the course familiarizes students with design language, which enables them to discuss design and exchange their viewpoints. The course covers design fields from city planning, architecture, lighting, cars, consumer products, to information, services and interaction design. Different design stories from different parts of the world are unfolded wherein the need, cultural and environmental specificity of the design in different societies and at different times are explained. Each week, a special topic is addressed, for example, form follows function, design and technology, color theory and so on.",

You'll get a 3D-printed model once you complete your design. There' will be also an exhibition for the project.",
            "comment_teaching": "Luisa is very friendly and is willing to guide us through the design concepts and projects. She always provides a lot of example in the classes and makes sure the class has great dynamics. She also encourages students to provide any comments in the class. Moreover, she always provides comments for every assignment, which is very helpful. <br /><br />As this is a new course, the professor slightly adjusted her teaching from time to time, but it should be okay afterwards. <br /><br />TAs are very helpful and responsive as well. If you're interested in 3D modelling, you can ask them during the final project.",
            "comment_grading": "1. Participation: 5%. <br />2. A Design Journal HW1-5 and mid-term presentation: 30%<br />3. A Design Journal, completed: 25%. <br />4. Final Design Project and presentation: 40%. <br /><br />Attendance is critical. As it is a pretty small class, Luisa and TAs recognize every student. 85% attendance (present for 11 classes) is required. Those who cannot achieve 85% attendance are marked one grade down. Those who are absent for 6 classes cannot pass this course.<br /><br />There are clear instructions and rubrics for every assignment and projects, so you don't have to worry that the grading will be subjective. You always got chances to improve your assignments before midterm and final reviews. <br /><br />- Midterm design journal review: 29/30, mean: 22.12<br />- Final design journal review and complete design journal: above average (didn't reveal the grade) <br />- Final grade: A+",
