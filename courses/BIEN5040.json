        "description": "This course will provide a survey of Neuroscience and Neuroengineering research areas to provide our research postgraduate students a broad appreciation of interdisciplinary research in context. The course aims to help student recognize and understand how knowledge from science and engineering interface in this interdisciplinary application. Concepts such as neural interfacing and neural prosthesis will be introduced so that students can understand the impact of the latest technologies. The course will enhance the vision of the students and encourage them to work in future inter-disciplinary research fields.",

But the cooperation of second project was not good. Prof. Wang was very unhappy with that. Although she said my part is fair enough, I got A- eventually.",
