        "description": "This course is about transients in pressurized water conveyance and distribution systems. It has four objectives: (1) gain an understanding of the phenomenon, (2) be able to model transients in systems, (3) know how to avoid harmful transients in system design and operation, and (4) use transient model(s) to detect anomalies. Instructor's consent is needed.",
