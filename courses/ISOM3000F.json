        "description": "A clear and concise communication of results is essential to a successful business analytics endeavor. In the context of business communication, data visualization could help deliver analytics results or tell stories by curating data into a form easy to understand and navigate, with the valuable information and insights explicitly highlighted. Furthermore, interactive visualization could also be combined with automated analysis to provide business decision makers an effective way to explore a large data set, make interpretation, drill down to uncover hidden patterns and deeper insights, so as to leverage their domain knowledge to guide the data analytics process. This course is intended to train students to understand and learn the human-centered approach in designing static or interactive visual presentation materials. Students will learn basic design principles to produce their own visual stories that address the business need of reporting and performance monitoring. Students will also be introduced with basic visual analytics techniques that employs computational media to reveal insights from large datasets. By completing the weekly hands-on exercises, students will also gain some practical experience of using modern Business Intelligence tools for data visualization and visual analytics.
