        "description": "This course provides fundamental understanding of material science, technology and manufacturing techniques of composite materials for high performance structures. Mechanical behaviour of composite materials will be reviewed in detail. Laboratory demonstration of one or two commonly used composite manufacturing techniques will be performed to provide more insight into the manufacture of composite structures. Applications of manufacturing of composite aerospace components will be discussed. Mechanical behaviours and failure of a typical composite material structures will be studied.",
