Thus, it is recommended to review what you have learnt in LIFS1902.<br /><br />Although LIFS1902 is not a prerequisite for this course, you would be a fool to believe HKUST on this. This course is very content-heavy and relies both on understanding and memorization in order to get a good grade.<br /><br />You can see that the topics covered in Finals is much greater than that of Midterms, so it is highly recommended to make your own notes as early as possible, or you would be overwhelmed by the shear amount of content.",

Banfield really likes to go off on tangents which you actually need to take note of, as everything he says would be included in the midterm.<br /><br />Guo is a lot more direct with his wording, being clear and concise. He makes great use of his powerpoint slides, and rarely says anything beyond it. This makes his lecture notes much more valuable during revision.",

I learned a lot from the professors in this course.<br /><br />Banfield: There is a lot of extra information that he likes to include in his lectures (as he tends to go off topic occasionally). He does manage to get the point across though. His English is quite proficient and so it does take a while to get used to his teaching style, nothing too difficult though. His powerpoints are quite useless on their own, so it's definitely recommended to take notes on whatever he says in class.<br /><br />Guo: Very straightforward and goes straight to the point. His powerpoints are extremely organized with objectives and summaries at the beginning &amp; the end. It was very easy to follow because he used a lot of amazing diagrams from the textbook, and if there was a difficult concept, he would go over it two or three times. The powerpoint was quite detailed on its own, but there were occasions where he would say something important that wouldn't be mentioned in the powerpoint, so it is still important to take notes (especially when the slide only shows a diagram and he explains the process in class).",

The course is mainly lectures with little Q&amp;A sections for any related questions. The two professors are both opened to any questions and try their best in answering all of them. Somtimes when the question are out of their profession, they would seek for help after class or organise meeting with students to discuss on it. <br />Banfield: <br />He teaches the first part of the course and spend more time on introducing the field of cell biology. His english is easy to listen but sometimes sounds too boring in an 1.5 hr lecture (especially when the lectures starts at 9 in the morning). His ppt is not the best illustration of the content but it is as best you could ask for from a lifs professor. I would prefer reading reference books recommanded, such as Essential Cell Biology or The Cell A Molecular Approach, to strengthen your understanding on each topic.<br /><br />Guo: <br />He teached more content and weights higher in the course grading. It is beacuse he teaches more in depth on the nucleus, vesicular tranport, cytoskeleton etc. with sophisticated examples. He provides vivid diagram and figures to help student understand the formation, structure and movement within cells. Video demonstration of the stuctures and mechanisms are also used to help students understanding.",

            "comment_teaching": "Professor Banfield is terrible. He has no accent and his English is good, which should be a good thing. But as he keeps saying unnecessary parenthesis and keep speaking superfast, it seems as if he is showing off his English. He is also good at making simple things more difficult to understand and make you more confused than not asking. He pauses in the middle of the class to answer some questions asked by some students, which is quite disturbing sometimes. His slildes are also in a mess, with few knowledge and mostly pictures displayed in a very inorganized way. I saw some previous students saying that it is because his lectures are organized to demonstrate processes of solving questions, which is important scientific training for students aiming for research. I really can't agree. I strongly recommend you&nbsp;&nbsp;read corresponding chapters in the textbook if you want to get good grade in the midterm, which is designed by Banfield. He already taught in a very chaotic way and still he tested quite a number of things not covered in his lectures.<br />On the contrary, although professor GUO has some accent, he explained things clearly and in detail. He asked some questions to guide students along each topic and cover related experimental methods adopted by scientists under each topic. His ppt is also clear and organized in a logical way. He finishes one powerpoint each lecture, divide each lecture into several parts and gives a few minutes's break during the class. He is very willing to answer students' questions after the lecture and gives one or two polling questions each class. However, I still recommend you read the textbook after the lecture to have a better understanding of the topic. (Textbooks always display the knowledge in a more organized way, and this may help you better clarify?) I prefer Prof.GUO's teaching style.",

I once did not believe his course reviews but ended up finding out 'His train of thought is like five trains coming at the same time' is the most accurate description I can possibly find. He always explains simple stuff in complicated manners, confusing us and also sometimes himself. Plus his slides are predominantly diagrams, making understanding even harder.<br /><br />On the contrary, Prof. Guo is a decent lecturer. Though with accents, he is able to organize &amp; deliver his content in a very structured and interconnected manner. Intuitive explanations such as 'any cell response that involves gene expression and or duplication will be a slower response' are also provided. He also asks many questions during lessons and points out many significant details that really allow the incorporation of concepts.",

I simply had no idea why some of you can get 70+ under Prof. Banfield's teaching and his confusing questions (Probably by studying the textbook or taking other courses?) My estimation is I was in the top 12% of the class.<br /><br />Final (65%)<br /><br />The total score was 85, with (if I recall correctly) 70 single-choice MCQs and 5 short questions. Originally there was an essay question, but Prof Guo kindly offered to remove it.<br /><br />The final exam score was not disclosed. My estimation of my score is about 80+ (Since it is an online semester so I marked all the questions I am uncertain about on my draft papers and confirmed the answers after the exam)<br /><br />Eventually got an A+. Prof Guo's final really saved my grade.<br /><br />One tip for preparing for the final is to interconnect everything you have learned. For instance, compare treadmilling of actin filaments with the dynamic instability of microtubules. Or extract and summarize all cell processes that either (1) Involve GTP (2) Involve ATP (3) Involve phosphorylation (kinase) (4) Involve ubiquitin etc. <br /><br />This is because the questions spanned through multiple chapters and often dig into seemingly unimportant details. I'll say that even if you cheat and have all PPT slides beside you, it is not likely that you can retrieve all these information accurately from the sea of content. Hence: Understand, memorize and connect!!",
            "comment_workload": "No assignment so the work schedule is quite flexible. But if you want good grades then you definitely need to invest your time &amp; effort.<br /><br />For Prof. Banfield's part, I attended every single lecture and revise once per week. Not very helpful I'll say. Textbooks serve you better than his lectures.<br /><br />For Prof Guo's part, I skipped almost all lectures and only hopped in last minute to screenshot his end-of-lecture quiz questions (not graded and not counted for participation, but will likely appear in the final exam). I would stock his lecture videos on the same topic and finish them in a marathon. <br /><br />I think this approach was more helpful since I could pause whenever I feel confused, take notes, google, summarize and then proceed with a solid grasp of previous content. Takes about 2-3 hours per week in going through lecture videos, and I will take an extra 2-3 hours in revising the content.",
