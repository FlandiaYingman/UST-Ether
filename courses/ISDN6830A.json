Here, we call this â€œDeThink: We will go through the concept of Design Thinking in a practical, fun and interactive manner. We will use a variety of tools to practice design thinking. We will also use some easy to use, yet power software tools to launch prototypes. Areas we will touch upon ranges from using artificial intelligence for brainstorming and even building business plan to connecting different technology eco-systems with ease. Yet, all these are done within the DeThink framework. In the first part of the course, we will focus on the DeThink process. In the later part of the course, we will focus on entrepreneurship. Finally, we will create a project to tie all the concepts together. At various sections of the course, we will invite seasoned speaker to share with you their views and experiences on relevant topics.
