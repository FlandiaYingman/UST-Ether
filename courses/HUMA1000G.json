        "name": "Cultures and Values: Love, Death and Human Nature",
        "description": "Three basic values will be explored in this course: Love, death and human nature. Lectures and readings will be built upon selected texts of Chinese philosophy and religion. For the concept of love, love as benevolence in Confucius’ and Mencius’ thoughts and love as universal love in Mohism will be compared and explored. For the concept of death, a naturalistic view of death in contrast to death viewed by Chinese Buddhism and religious Taoism will be introduced. A Confucian view of death will be put forward as a dialectical unity of the previous two seemingly contradictory views of death. As for the concept of human nature, various traditional views of human nature will be discussed and a suggestion is given to explain why Mencius’ idea that human nature is good triumphs over other views and becomes the orthodox view of human nature in the Chinese tradition.",

The reading material come from many famous ancient Chinese philosophers, so it’s quite difficult for non-Chinese to understand the full meaning due to translation issue. <br /><br />All reading PDFs are well prepared and the key points are well delivered. Each topic follows corresponding discussion, where students need to share their views and counterarguments timely and frequently to get a high grade.<br /><br />There is a essay workshop attached to this class. Basically it teaches you to write each paragraph professionally. Very helpful. Each workshop session teaches you to write one paragraph, so you don’t need to work hard to finish your final essay before deadline.<br /><br />Finally, the final essay provides you 3 topics concerning each topic that the course has discussed. You can choose your favorite topic to complete your essay.<br />**<br />Topic 1: Love<br />Mozi - On Universal Love<br />The Analects - On Love As Humanity<br />Mencius - On Love<br />Topic 2: Death <br />**The material under this topic is way too difficult to understand :( **<br />Wang Chung - A Treatise on Death<br />Fung Yu-lan - Contemporary Debate on the Immortality of the Soul<br />Pao-pu Tzu - The belief in Immortals<br />Zhuangzi - The Secret of Caring for Life<br />Liu Zhongzhou - Teaching on Life and Death<br />Topic 3: Human Nature<br />Xunzi&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Man’s Nature is Evil<br />Han Yu - An Inquiry on Human Nature<br />Mencius - Human Nature is Good",
