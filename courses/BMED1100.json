        "description": "The course provides an overview about the health problems facing the world today, and the current situations of developed and developing regions are compared and contrasted. The contribution of modern technologies, and frugal technologies in particular, to improve human health will be described. The elements of successful innovation will be explored in a broader context, such that in addition to technology product itself, the process of technology development, diffusion and implementation will be discussed. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the barriers for translating health care technology to application, including scientific, economic and cultural factors, and especially their impact in resource‐poor settings. Throughout the course, the concept of global village and global citizenship will be emphasized.",
