        "description": "Through real-time videoconferencing with participants from different countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, and Philippines, this ONLINE course aims at helping students learn the definitions of global health ethics and bioethics, the different protocol and systems in place to ensure adherence to ethical principles, and how different stakeholders and cultures may interpret ethics differently. Through case studies on ethical challenges from real-world situations, students will analyze and discuss the complexities of global health practice and research ethics in a global context. This course is co-offered with the University of Southern California. Besides the joint LIVE sessions, face-to-face sessions and group projects are also arranged for the introduction of background knowledge, case studies, group project discussion, and technical support.",
