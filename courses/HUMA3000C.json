        "description": "This course introduces three different film genres: art films, independent films, and documentary films. It aims to usher students into the creative world of film appreciation and filmmaking. By introducing selective masterpieces of art films, independent films, and documentary films, this course explores various aesthetics, narratives, styles, and techniques of Western and Chinese films. Based on the forms of film screening, seminar discussion, practical film making, students will not only learn how to appreciate different genres of films, but also get the opportunity to produce a short film of their own. Since this course will invite several documentary film directors and independent film directors as guest speakers from time to time, they will also join the instructor to teach how to make a real film and allow students to have the first-hand experience of film making. Unlike traditional courses that are based on lectures, readings, exams, and papers in a fixed classroom, this experimental course encourages students to express themselves through a hands-on independent film making or documentary film making.",
