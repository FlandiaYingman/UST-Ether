It can serve as a standalone introduction to physics or as a preparatory course for students who intend to take PHYS 1112. It is not a preparatory course for PHYS 1111; students with no calculus background who plan to take General Physics should take calculus concurrently with PHYS 1101 so that they meet the prerequisites for PHYS 1112. Topics covered include heat and gases, force and motion, waves, and electricity and magnetism.",

            "comment_workload": "Light workload despite assignments every week<br /><br />You do have to do 2 assignments per week, but they are literally just 2-3 questions per assignment(just allocate 20 minutes to do the assignments a day after the lecture and you'll be fine there)<br /><br />Whether or not you buy the textbook is completely your choice. <br />I must say however, that just doing assignments and worked examples would not be sufficient in this course to do well in exams. The content they give you apart from the textbook is simply not enough. Furthermore, like 70% of the questions from the finals were the medium difficulty questions in the chapter review sections of the textbook<br /><br />You're allowed to write your own &quot;data sheets&quot; so no need to memorize formulas for this course; one A4 sized sheet for midterms, two for finals.",
