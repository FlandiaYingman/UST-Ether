My plan worked. <br /><br />Yet be mindful that this course does not count towards anything (not SSC, not CC)<br /><br />The content is pretty elementary, very basic. You will be taught verbs etre and avoir, how to conjugate them in the present tense. <br /><br />Apart from vocab, verbs, grammar, you will also be taught about the French culture. I found this portion of the classes quite interesting, and wished there was more in-depth discussion about French culture, way of life, politics, etc.<br /><br />Attendance is compulsory and there is no leeway to miss any classes. <br /><br />It is required to buy the textbook, but a pdf version is available online.",
            "comment_teaching": "Mark is a nice, cheerful guy. He is very travelled, very cultured, very mature, and very worldly. <br /><br />He is understanding if you have to miss a class, and makes exceptions. Rules don't have to be carved in stone. <br /><br />He creates a positive learning environment and is cheerful. His classes were a break from the other hectic courses I had.",

            "comment_content": "The course is an introduction to French and the French culture. Mark did not teach us the phonetics intentionally in a systematic way, but rather taught it in an integrated way when we encounter a particular word. Grammar-wise, the present tense and a little bit of the future tense were covered. The mandatory textbook is Panorama (only the first unit is covered), and Mark will also give handouts for some lessons in Bienvenue en France, plus some extra materials which are generally quite useful. Quite an amount of vocab will be encountered in class and if you work hard enough, you will definite learn a lot.",
            "comment_teaching": "Mark is definitely an excellent teacher and I would give out A+ if there is an option for that. He is a language master, I would say, being able to speak multiple languages and still learning Russian. He really knows a lot about the things (historical/cultural/geographical) behind some linguistic manifestations. In terms of French culture, he is very knowledgeable and passionate, he would be able to comment on almost every subject that we talked about in the cultural presentations. And at the end of semester, he brought us French wine, cheese and bread for tasting.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is absolutely fair and transparent. Mark gives back our work (quizzes, writings even where we lost our marks in the oral task) for each assessment with detailed grading. The class is quite competitive though, there are quite a few GBUS students who have learned some basic French and some of them will get really high marks in the quizzes. I personally do not have any prior learning experience of French but I consider myself as having the talent for learning languages and worked reasonably hard and got a satisfactory grade. The exams are not too hard in general, given that you pay attention in class, finish the assignments and review accordingly.",
            "comment_workload": "Tbh, the workload is heavier than average UST courses, but it's definitely worth it. Presentations every 2 weeks, although it's not-graded, I felt a need to do the presentations well because Mark is such a passionate teacher otherwise I feel guilty for disappointing him. There was 1 reading and writing final, 1 oral final, and 1 listening final. Throughout the semester, there were about 4 assignments which we needed to submit but not counted towards our final grade and also about 4 assessments on speaking, listening, reading, writing.",

Quite interesting if you love france because it also introduce a lot of culture stuffs. The class requires the textbook which i think is quite expensive, but if you want to continue the french study then i suggest you to buy coz the fee charging french course supported by the language center use the same book. Also, Mark would give out a lot of handouts to us for teaching. For a begin of learning french, the content is not that difficult and suitable for beginners.",
            "comment_teaching": "Mark is a very nice guy and a good french teacher. He taught us a lot of vocabs which related to the topics and provide a lot of information about France as a local. Also, he is a talkative person, he can chat with the student even out of the class. Compare with other french teachers, he is funny and hilarious so that the class would not be boring at all. At the end of the semester he would bring a lot of wine and cheese to the class and let us try. Very happy and good experience for summing up the course.",
            "comment_grading": "Good grade. I think i am the average one in the class but still got B. Note that there are many exchanges and people who have learnt french in the class, but i still got B so I think it is very good grade.",
            "comment_workload": "A little bit heavy workload. We have to do group presentation about the culture in France biweekly. No marks for those presentations but still learn a lot of stuffs in throughout the presentations. Many small quizzes and homework need to finish, but i think it's appropriate because it can make sure the students are catching up to the classes. All of them are not difficult, you can just spent half an hour to revise before the quizzes. Homework are quite easy if you go to class. One more essay need to be submitted at the end of the course. It is related to the culture but the specific topics are decided by ourselves. It has written final exam and listening and oral exam in class. Not that difficult as Mark give us the topics and all of them are the content we have learnt.",
