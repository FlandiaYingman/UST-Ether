These fucking damn 1402 and 1403 courses are the only courses in my entire year 1 that were below A. Even though all my other courses are A+ or A, the two lang courses just took me back to pre-liberation. Fuck you, CLE! Fuck you, 1402 and 1403S!!!",

Elza will involve many random presentations and group work in class, where you discuss with your group mates and choose one person to present in front of the class. Doing this kind of presentation can boost your oral English.<br />I really make some friends in this course.<br />She is very kind and willing to help you with your essay after class.&nbsp;&nbsp;She provides detailed materials to improve our writing skills, but these exercises are completely voluntary. The teaching method is a bit like high school English class.",
