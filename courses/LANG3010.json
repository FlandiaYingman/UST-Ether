            "comment_content": "No textbook, instructor will make the notes based on students' preferences on what skills they want to focus on. Although the notes seem to be brief, it does help us to understand the direct way to improve the skills. All in all, language skills are immersed through time (you are god if you can master in 3 months), so I am quite satisfied with the materials.",
            "comment_teaching": "At the beginning instructor will ask students to talk about what kind of skills they want to improve (writing skills, presentation skills) , and then instructor will tailor-make the notes. Topics are interesting to induce the skills.<br /><br />P.s. There is one lecture instructor started with &quot;job interview&quot; and see if students can demonstrate good speaking skills (also give you precious opinion on future job interview!), so not just language skills but also skills outside academics.",

Nearly impossible to get A+. But if you get really good score in Project 2, you still have the chance to get an A (thats me).<br /><br />What she discussed about the grading:<br />Average 5 -&gt; B-<br />Average 6 -&gt; A-",

If you are smart enough, you will take this course at Final Year so that you can use you capstone project to complete Project 2~",
