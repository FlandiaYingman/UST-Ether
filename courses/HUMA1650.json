One challenge would be that you will have to memorise name of artists and artwork, which many of them are in Italian. Easy to get A range if you're interested in history of art or good at memorising . There are quite a few field trips to galleries. Last semester, we went to K11 atelier to watch the Glow like that exhibition. For group project, you are allowed to form your own group and will have to pick a modern artwork to research on and present. The artwork has to be exhibited in HK during the time period she has set, hence you will have to go to different exhibitions with your group mates.",

Midterm only includes MC <br />*Final is non-cumulative<br />*Grade distribution for final: 30% for MC and 10% for short essay. There will be three questions you can choose from for the short essay and you only have to answer one of them.

However, since the questions in the exams are very straight-forward and doesn't required critical thinking, it means that you would be able to get the answers right if you have study, read through the powerpoint thoroughly, and really memorize all the materials in the ppt then you would be good to go. All in all, I think this is a good course for you to gain adequate and introductory knowledge on western art, but only take it if you are willing to spend LOTS of time to memorize the factual materials.",

(on the other note, there are lots of technicals terms that are not only in English, but other languages, so it requires you to look up those words in order to have a great understanding of the content) But overall, the distribution of grade is quite good, I think if you get a slightly above mean in general, you would get B range but not C, so it's better than the normal courses in UST.",

            "comment_teaching": "She teaches very well but many contents are listed on PPT, so what you 've heard is basically somehow the same as the words on ppt.",
            "comment_grading": "well I am quite satisfied cuz I didn't go through reading materials at all. I only spared 3 days to memorize all the points and prepared the essay the professor needed. Answer to many questions can be find on ppt so all you need to do is to go through ppt carefully with patience.",
            "comment_workload": "What's more can I say? If you wanna learn something, HUMA1650 is a very good class but speaking of workload, it's a totally different situation. If you wanna get good grades, there are soooooo many things you need to memorize just like typical kinda of humanities class. But if you choose to escape from the diligent hard work like me, you can be quite relaxed. So what i can say is it depends on you.",
