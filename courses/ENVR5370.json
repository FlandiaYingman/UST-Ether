        "description": "This course provides postgraduate students the opportunity to enhance their multidisciplinary understanding of sustainable energy systems, transitions, and policy, with regards to the need to deliver sustainable development for all and accelerating climate action. With climate change accelerating, the ways we generate, distribute and use energy has been duly challenged, opening up new opportunities to rethink a rapid shift from fossil fuel-based generation to the deployment of sustainable energy systems. This course offers students a wide range of topics from conventional to renewable energy generation to electric mobility and transport to transmission and storage to markets and multi-level policy approaches to effect sustainable energy transitions. The course exposes the students to the sociotechnical nature of energy systemsâ€”in Hong Kong, China, and internationally, and an understanding that energy systems are not purely technological systems but are also embedded within politics and social dynamics.",
