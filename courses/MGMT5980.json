        "description": "Successful organizations excel by the quality of their offerings and services in the market place. Internally, leaders and managers distinguish themselves by the quality of their decisions. As leaders and managers, you will find that your decision making ability is tested and challenged at work every day. Your ability to make quality decisions will determine your long term professional success and the success of your organization. Quality management decisions do not need to be hit and miss, nor should they be based on titles and ranks. Quality decision making is a competence that can be acquired and a discipline that should be practiced.",
