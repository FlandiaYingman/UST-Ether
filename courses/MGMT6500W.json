        "description": "The course will introduce students to one of the most original ways of developing strategy to appear in business thinking in recent years known as Blue Ocean Strategy. Blue Ocean Strategy was developed by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, both professors of strategy and management at the INSEAD business school. Their approach to strategy innovation is widely recognized as a significant step forward in strategic thinking and has been adopted by many companies to help them develop innovative strategy. In this course we will use a series of Harvard case studies to understand and apply Blue Ocean strategy. The case studies will be included in the reading for the course. Students will work in teams to apply the learning and practical tools they acquire in the course.",
