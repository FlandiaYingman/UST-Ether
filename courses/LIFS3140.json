She is probably the worse professor I have ever met, there is no doubt that her power point is detailed.

He teaches with heart and&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;nice&quot; is an understatement for him; however, he is not helped by his slow and accented speech. <br /><br />Anyway, this is the part where you should grab as much points as possible to secure a good grade as everyone does well here.<br /><br />King Chow<br />Attending a lecture by Prof Chow is like watching an episode of Sherlock; it is an exhilarating ride that's truly thrilling and enthralling - but that is if you could understand the convoluted plot. For others who, unfortunately, could not decipher his lectures, it is the most confusing thing in the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the &quot;others&quot; include the majority of the class: the average score for his section is 6.20/20, which KC already considers &quot;quite high&quot; (last year it's 3.78/20)<br /><br />Danny Leung<br />Quite the eloquent speaker. Native accent, appropriate speed and clear delivery in a somewhat comfortable traditional style of teaching. Uses lively examples to demonstrate his concepts.<br /><br />His lectures were kind of straight forward and not too difficult, so most students wouldn't encounter problems here.<br /><br />Xue Hong<br />Absolute waste of time. Horrendous accent and sluggish teaching pace, not to mention the fact that she reads directly from her powerpoint slides. I finished all her lectures and tutorials (I skipped them) in maybe 3 or 4 hours.",

In reality, Eugene just sets the grade thresholds according to the distribution so it's not really that different from grading on a pro-rata basis/拉curve.<br />Overall grading (%):<br />A+ (&gt;= 80), A (75-79.99), A- (70-74.99)<br />B+ (65-69.99), B (59-64.99), B- (53-58.99)<br />C+ (47-52.99), C (41-46.99), C- (35-40.99)<br />D (25-34.99), F (&lt; 25)<br />Mean = 53.13; SD = 16.8 <br />I got lucky and snatched an A+ with 80.13% (yay).",
            "comment_workload": "Some people call genetics a &quot;killer course&quot; as its style differs from traditional life science courses quite a lot (well at least for KC's part and arguably Eugene's) as there wasn't much rote memorisation and require a great deal of logical deductions and reasoning, as well as a clear grasp of the underlying concepts. Therefore, one is expected to devote more effort and time towards this course. <br /><br />There are weekly assignments which would be discussed during a tutorial session. They are not graded though, so you're not obliged to work on them. However, I would strongly recommend everyone to at least finish Eugene's and KC's assignments, the former being essential to familiarise yourself with the calculations (it gets mechanical as you work on more problems); and the latter being a fun thought exercise.",

            "comment_teaching": "This course is taught by 4 professors this year<br />Eugene taught the first month or so, then King Chow until midterm, and then Danny and Hannah after midterm.<br /><br />Eugene<br />He's a pretty clear in teaching the concepts, and really makes sure you understand (if he doesn't get good responses he'll literally put together another powerpoint to reexplain the problem the next lecture)<br />He repeats the key concepts 3 times though, so it's okay to zone out a bit in class<br />What I don't like is he doesn't do enough practice questions with us in class, so I don't know how to do like half of the tutorial questions<br />If he taught faster and did a bit more practice with us that would be great.<br /><br />King Chow<br />KC doesn't really teach according to his powerpoint<br />His classes are more discussion sessions on key concepts and then 5 minutes later he'll be like, &quot;okay so we covered this, this, and this&quot; -skips a bunch of slides-<br />It's okay though, because his exam isn't according to his powerpoint anyway. Just treat his powerpoint as some key concepts (which he will stress over and over again in class) + other interesting information you may want to know (which he will skip in class)<br />His exam questions are more experimental design and big picture stuff, and the tutorial questions should give you a good idea what they will be like.<br />Oh, and don't sit in the front if you're scared of being asked questions; he points to people sometimes.<br />But if you're into scientific discussions, KC's classes will be very interesting and fun.<br /><br />Danny<br />A new professor in LIFS (and a very cute one indeed)<br />I have a feeling he's going the KC route, but he's less intimidating I guess?<br />He teaches clearly but very quickly, perhaps even faster than KC (because he's covering things on the powerpoint, unlike KC's discussion style)<br />His exam is very much based on the powerpoint, but there is one long question that was like an experimental design problem (like what KC would give, really)<br />So if you have no problems with KC's style you'll probably enjoy Danny just as much (or even a bit more)<br />Oh, and study the tutorial questions (at least memorize the answers). Some of the MCs may appear in the final ;)<br /><br />Hannah<br />She basically reads off her very word-full powerpoint, and you may feel slightly... drowsy during class. Be sure to read the textbook chapters she posts too though, because they will appear in the exam.<br />I'm not a fan of her posting tutorial questions like 3 hours before the tutorial, because neither we nor the tutor have enough time to look at them, so we're all just thinking about the questions for the first time in class. As a result, our tutor's teaching quality greatly dropped during those two classes.<br />She taught 2 chapters this year, Chapter 19 and 23 (see attached course outline for details)<br />The exam questions for chapter 23 were okay, if you understand the powerpoint and the textbook you should be able to get them right (they're pretty much just calculations and basic concepts on population genetics)<br />However, the questions on chapter 19 (genomics) were... I have no idea where they came from. They were very paper/research-based, asking you to make inferences from some random conclusion. I wasn't even sure I was in the right exam room when I did them.<br />Just give it up to luck. Chances are, others will do just as poorly.",

The final exam composed of around 30 MCs, 10 or so short questions and a few long questions.

He is a good teacher, only if you are smart enough to follow his mind. He speaks at normal speed, but you will feel headache after every class. You can skip his lecture, but you need to watch lecture videos, make sure you understand everything he says. His midterm, you don't even need to practice the exercise from tutorials or from the book, because basically his exam is WAY harder than that. <br />2. Eugene: nice, willing to explain everything. But probably too nice and will not stop until he explained everything. His part is easier in understanding wise, but still quite complicated, which you need to grasp by doing all the exercises that he told you to do, then you definitely do well in his exams as he will put similar questions in it..<br />3. Xue Hong: basically don't go to her class, unless your hobby is wasting your life. She won't explain anything, and her notes are literally just copied from the text book directly. So she sucks, period. And her part was all MCs, super amazingly hard(even though everyone in previous years said they were easy)",
