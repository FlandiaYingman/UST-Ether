Instead it is more of a &quot;creativity&quot; class than &quot;ar`t&quot;. However the course really doesn't really teach you to be creative, so its better if you are already kind of creative or passionate about arts. <br /><br />Despite the mediocre content, I had alot of fun in this course, perhaps the most fun I've had in UST. The weekly assignments were really interesting and original, they feel like a breath of fresh air. The project was also really fun, Benny gives alot of supportive input and is encouraging, although I spent a really long time on the artwork, it felt really rewarding to complete.<br /><br /><br /><br />Course content:<br />(1) Arts and creativity<br />(2) Convergent and divergent thinking<br />(3) Free association and forced association<br />(4) Ways of seeing<br />(5) Medium<br />(6) Synesthesia<br />(7) Collection<br />(8) Design thinking<br />(9) Critical thinking<br />(10) Fictioning",
            "comment_teaching": "Benny's teaching kind of sucks. <br />The course actually contains many interesting concepts in its curriculum / learning objectives, but the content Benny teaches is really brief and minimal.<br /><br />In the first three tutorials, we would have some practical exercises like some paper origami, paper cutting and tissue paper sculptures. They were really fun and I actually was looking forward for the next sessions. <br />But it seems that after the three tutorials, Benny just gave up, and after that we just spent all the tutorial discussing each other's homework assignments, which was stupidly boring and waste of time.<br /><br />Attendance is taken for both tutorial and lecture. So you cant even skip them.",
            "comment_grading": "Honestly the grading was kind of BS - I legit nearly got full marks for all grading criteria and still only got an A&nbsp;&nbsp;(no one got A+ in class btw). I know I sound really ungrateful, but holy shit I actually went super tryhard for assignments, project, essay and class participation. Even after few months I am still really butthurt about this. sorry :(<br /><br />I guess everything is subjective. So just hope Benny likes you and your artwork, or kiss his ass more to get a better grade. :)<br /><br />Grading:<br />Individual Artwork (50%)<br />Learning Portfolio (10%) - (Weekly homework)<br />Written Essay (20%)<br />Critique (20%)",
            "comment_workload": "There assignments every week. The assignments were pretty simple, they take like 1-2 hours to complete.<br /><br />But you'll have to prepare a final artwork to present to your class. The theme for the project was &quot;Machines&quot;, you'll have to interpret the theme in your own way and provoke ideas / statements through your work. You will have to present your work to your class at the end, and there will be a Q&amp;A session afterwards for each students.<br />The project is definitely be what spent most of my time on. You have to plan your ideas and present it to the class for discussion and input, and that will guide the scope / idea of your project. Make sure to email or talk to Benny (or your instructor) about your main idea for their input since they are the one marking.<br />** Don't be too constricted by the theme, since you are apparently supposed to &quot;think outside the box&quot; or be creative. Benny actually encouraged us to be more metaphorical. (Basically just BS your way through lol) <br /><br />There is a 500-800 word essay about anything you've experienced throughout the course (artist, style, medium, artworks, concepts etc) that influenced your artwork. This part is pretty simple. Personally I chose to just write about an artist + concept which influenced my work. <br /><br />And finally there is the critique. It is just a 200-300 word long response to any 2 artwork by your peers. Probably the simplest part of the course lol. We write this after the presentations / Q&amp;A, so its really easy :P<br /><br /><br />There is actually a fair amount of work, but most of it is really chill and relaxing imo. <br />Assignments + project were kind of fun and there wasn't too much written work, so I didn't really feel burdened by this course.",
