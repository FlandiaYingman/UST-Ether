            "comment_content": "This course covers 2 parts in this semester:<br />Matrix Analysis<br />Linear System Theory<br /><br />Matrix analysis part talks about all matrix stuff, it expands (nearly every question) into multi-dimensional sense.<br />Linear system theory uses the knowledge from matrix analysis, and talks more about control, but again in matrices.<br /><br />At the beginning, Prof Qiu set up a questionnaire to ask students' preference so that he can adapt the teaching content accordingly. It is very considerable, although the teaching proportion of these 2 parts are still 50%-50%, as before.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is great. I had very few prerequisite knowledge for this course, but can still catch up most of the points.<br /><br />In some weeks, the course was run in a face-to-face mode. Prof Qiu wrote things on board precisely and he would like to have some interactions with students.<br />The most challenging part of his teaching is the proofs. Sometimes he assumed most students knew the prerequisite knowledge and asked us to go through after class. But unfortunately I was not one of those students so it could cause me a big headache.<br /><br />Anyway, it is still a good course, and I learned a lot of useful knowledge.",
            "comment_grading": "Due to COVID-19, there is no exams. Instead, we have assignments and a final project:<br /><br />6 assignments (released per fortnight): 50%<br />Final project: 50%<br /><br />Assignments are just questions randomly picked from lecture notes, and the project requires extra reading materials so that we can explain the new ideas based on the knowledge we had both from this course and the materials.<br /><br />Finally, got A+. The grading is really nice.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload of assignment is high.<br />At the beginning, I can finish only one question within a whole night, but there were 5-6 questions in each assignment. That was really a suffering time and I started to doubt my IQ.<br />But almost every question is doable. Sometimes the questions cannot be worked out directly from seeing lecture notes, and these certainly require extra research on the internet.<br /><br />The project took 2-3 days to prepare and record. It is fine after a whole semester's studying.",
