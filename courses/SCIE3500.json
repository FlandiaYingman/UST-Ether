Together with SCIE 4500, these two courses comprise of two terms of research experience on a non-textbook specialized topic under the supervision of a faculty member, aiming to equip students with hands-on laboratory experience or independent studies and doing research reports. The course also aims at training  students’  research  communication  and collaboration skills through discussion on their research topics and presentation of findings to peers and faculty members in different disciplines / areas of research. For IRE students only.",

Informal meeting notes should be kept in a bound (or electronic) notebook.)<br /><br />Week 7<br />: Submit progress report (≤ 5 pages excluding figures and tables) <br /><br />Week 8~12<br />: Meet with supervisor/research group<br /><br />Week 13<br />: Submit final report (≤ 20 pages) by Nov 30<br /><br />Study Break<br />: Student’s Presentations <br /><br />Basically attending the lab every week to design the experiments and learn experimental skills. The project can be your own idea or most of the time, participating in the lab's ongoing project.",
            "comment_teaching": "You need to find a good supervisor (Professor) and even more importantly a good PG student who will teach and interact with you through this course. <br /><br />I was lucky enough to get both a good professor and a PG but from what others say if your supervisor is harsh and PG students have some personality issues you might have a really hard time in the lab.<br /><br />Whoever you choose, he or she might write you a reference letter for the upcoming SCIE3900 so work hard and try to impress them as much as you can.",

But to be honest, they might not read your reports because professors are always super busy. So, try to perform well and impress the professor in the final presentation, and answer their questions if they ask you something.<br /><br />Overall: A",
            "comment_workload": "It really varies from person to person. But even though I've got a very hearty professor and PG student who respects my own time, I was quite busy. <br /><br />The submission of reports and final presentation are overlapping with the exam schedule so you should be diligent to handle both your academics and lab life. <br /><br />Every experiment takes up quite a lot of time so I suggest you spare a block of time (4~6hrs), 2~4 days in a week, and devote yourself to the research in the assigned time.",
