        "description": "The course will be offered as an 2-credit course in the Spring semester. Students who have passed COMP4901N and have gotten the instructor consent can join COMP4901O in a subsequent Spring semester, they will be working together based on the knowledge they have learned from COMP4901O, forming teams to further investigate various advanced topics related to the more practical side of cybersecurity. They will then join the various cybersecurity contests. The students will get 2 credits for successfully completing COMP4901O. Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving. Instructor's approval is required.",

This year, our entire class of 15 participated as one team (Firebird) across four CTFs. I'd say we did fairly well.<br /><br />Onto presentations. In the first half of the course, expect lectures from seniors/experts which cover more advanced topics of cybersecurity and mindset. In the second half, expect classmates to wow you with their quickly-gained expertise or incompetence regarding one cybersecurity topic (which you get to choose, first-come first-serve).<br /><br />The topics we covered were:<br /> - Advanced Pwn <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Linux Kernel Pwn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ret2dl_resolve<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- House of Force<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- FSOP<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- DNS Rebinding<br /> - Advanced Reverse<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Advanced Angr<br /> - Advanced Web <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Expression Language Injection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- GraphQL<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Request Smuggling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- JS Prototype Pollution<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- NoSQL Injection<br /> - Advanced Crypto<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lattice-based Attacks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Post-quantum Crypto<br /> - Misc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Windows/Azure AD Attack<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Advanced OSINT<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sandbox Escape",

(35%)<br />Did you submit your peer reviews? (15%)<br />Did you present coherently and was your presentation well-received (by peers and instructors)? (50%)<br /><br />Then congrats, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. In fact, you're well on your way to an A+.<br /><br />Bonus:<br />Did you submit writeups?<br /><br />Unlike COMP4901N (now COMP2633), COMP4901O gives 2 credits, so there is stuff at stake.",
            "comment_workload": "Personally this course was more taxing than COMP4901N (COMP2633), but that was simply because I threw a lot of (too much?) time into the CTFs and presentation. Most CTFs start in a Western timezone, so if you want to be the first to find a flag, you'll need to scramble against your peers... in the ungodly hour of 2am HKT.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's pretty fun as well. I found it enjoyable to hunt with others for flags. There'll be multiple CTFs to participate in as well, so don't panic if you can't join all.<br /><br />Presenting was annoying but turned out to also be fun and chill once I decided to place a meme on every other slide.",
