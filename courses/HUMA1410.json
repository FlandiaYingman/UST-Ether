But what made it worse was that he always repeated what he said just now in Cantonese, which means international students could do nothing but wait for him speaking English again.<br /><br />And this course should have been taught by English only.",

            "comment_workload": "The workload is quite light. There were some readings, interesting but actually quite useless for exams. <br /><br />Four tutorials were done in tutorial classes, and no need to pay more attention after classes.<br /><br />However, both midterm and final were close-book exams, making us to recite tons of things.",
