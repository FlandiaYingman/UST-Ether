It tests on how the computer does the calculation. For example: You cant use the traditional way to solve for eigenvalues and eigenvectors during the exam, you have to use the QR algorithm, which is the method that is used by the computer to solve it.<br /><br />Also, be careful if the angles of sin and cosine functions are in radian, you have to switch the mode in your calculator when doing the calculations. Otherwise, you would get everything wrong. <br /><br />In my opinion, it would be very helpful if you can use the scientific calculator well (How to store answers and keep on doing further calculations). As there is limited time to do the calculations. <br /><br />The exam would not be very difficult if you attend all the lectures and pay attention in class.",
