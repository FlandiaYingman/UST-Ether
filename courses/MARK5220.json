        "description": "This course aims to explore and integrate the ancient Eastern wisdom into modern Western management science and apply to modern business competition. To achieve this goal, this course will use Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" as a vehicle to introduce the foundation of Eastern wisdom (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism) to management executives.

This course is to crystallize some concepts and ideas put forth in \"The Art of War\" into a few business strategic principles and an innovative framework of 4Stop so that these can be more easily understood and applied.",
