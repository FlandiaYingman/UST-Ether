        "description": "A project-based, experiential course that exposes students to practice the five modules in design thinking - “Empathize”, “Define”, “Ideate”, “Prototype” and ‘Test”. The unmet needs will be identified by observing the daily routine of real services and people. Research on existing solutions and how to conduct the stakeholder and market analyses will be taught for designing the needs screening matrix in needs selection. Students are going to unlock their creativity potentials through the in-class activities.The new ideas of addressing the unmet needs are generated in which the ideas are grouped ad organized into a concept map. To translate a promising concept from an idea into a rudimentary design, the concept exploration is facilitated by prototyping. The prototypes are tested by the potential users. This course aims to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, analytical, design and project management skills.",

The course lasts for 3 hours and around 2.5 hours are your individual presentations and he would give you some &quot;useful&quot; feedback... Most of the time you are just doing your own thing...<br /><br />TAs are very nice and helpful. They give you good advice and suggestions in tutorials. TBH I learnt most of the thing from TAs instead of the lecturer",
