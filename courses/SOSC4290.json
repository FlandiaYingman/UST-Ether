This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the concepts, principles, and evaluation methodologies of sustainable development. The course will introduce students to multidisciplinary approaches to apply these principles and methods to analyse sustainable development issues in China, such as energy resources and water pollution, transportation and urbanization, and climate change; and to explore solutions for China's future development. Governance and policy, technology, organizational and individual behavior are important elements affecting sustainable development and will be examined at international, national, and local levels.",
