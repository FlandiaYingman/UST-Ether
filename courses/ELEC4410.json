Plus since there is only one lecture per week, there is not much to study for midterm and final. Plus it is easy to catch up.<br /><br />The course contents are quite interesting if you are willing to learn this technology. <br /><br />Plus it is very easy. Just listen to what the professor says.",

You just need to understand the lecture notes. The mean is lower than expected.<br />Mean: 55 and SD: 19<br /><br />Group project marks are not shown.",
