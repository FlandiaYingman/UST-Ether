        "name": "The New Silk Route: Social Science Perspectives",
        "description": "Since its operationalization in 2015, the New Silk Route (also known as the Belt and Road ; 一 帶 一 路) has raised China's profile globally, especially in developing countries. Chinese investment and infrastructure building, as well as enhanced political and people-to-people ties, have been common features of the New Silk Route, which had continued to proliferate even during the pandemic. This course uses lectures and student presentations to examine the political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of the change resulting from the New Silk Route - for China, for host countries, and for third parties. The instructor and several lecturer scholars from institutions in Asia will present relevant areas of their own research. Students, working in teams, will lead one class discussion of a reading and will research and write a paper on a topic of their own choosing.",
