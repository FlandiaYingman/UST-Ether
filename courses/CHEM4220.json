But unfortunate as a year 4 student, I reg this class as it was told the workload is low and only mcs finals and midterms are included which was so different from the previous professor.",

Still, I am happy to learn from Stefan’s lecture and solve some calculation problems.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, part of the content of my course project is inspired by Stefan’s presentation. His presentation might seem unappealing at first glance because of messy slides and calm voice. But his elaboration does help you understand things broader, at least better than reading the slides alone.<br /><br />One thing problematic, however, is that he is unable to manage the time well.
