        "description": "Big History as an emerging interdisciplinary framework, provides a long term perspective to see the world through reconstructing the history from the big bang all the way to the present. In such a longer time scale, overview of stars, planetary and species evolution, as well as concepts in climate change and how it is related to sustainability of the planet's environment for its current inhabitants, including humanity, will be discussed. The physical science basis, impacts, risk, mitigation and adaptation measures of climate change will also be investigated (including technical and social solutions). For local and regional vulnerabilities, such as extreme weather events, sea-levels rise, storm surge and coastal flooding, will be covered. The significance of collective learning under the big history framework, both as a driver for our exponentially growing impacts, as well as for better solutions, will be highlighted.",

Although the number of words were not specified, it is recommended to have sufficient elaboration and explore in details to get a good score. I wrote more than 4000 words for each essay. Moreover, there was poster making for a group. Formerly in typical face-to-face lectures, there will be a poster display in Atrium. As it switched to the online course, I thought making a poster is unnecessary. I would say the workload is substantial in addition to midterm and IPRS.",

It covers major changing events since big bang till now like star formation, solar system formation, first life on Earth, etc...<br />With so much in the past, the course aims at allowing students to see the bigger picture of an issue (climate change) using the big history perspective.<br />Some of the course content is to some extent interesting to know about, for example, Alexis mentioned 99.9% of the species had gone extinct in the course of history and normally a specie live for around a million years.

It asks about something like what's the CO2 level before the industrial period so remembering every content in the notes will get you high marks.<br />Poster comes with a video presentation of 3-5 minutes, the link of the video should be placed on the poster.

            "comment_content": "This course mainly divides into two parts, Big History and climate change. <br /><br />When you look at course title you thought it is about climate change, however, half of the course is about big history which is the formation and evolution of earth.<br /><br />Then it covers IPCC report. More on the figures of the effects on climate change. And not too much on the solutions. There is only like two to three lectures on that.<br /><br />Alexis also invited some guest speaker for the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Alexis played so many videos in the lectures and the video are indeed so boring. Half of the class fall asleep and do other stuffs.<br /><br />Some lectures you can jot down lots of things but some you cannot jot any.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is not too bad, but don't expect that much.<br />There is no final exam. How you perform in the midterm really affects your grade a lot.",
            "comment_workload": "Since there is only a mid-term and no final exam, you do not need to pay a lot of attention after mid-term. <br /><br />In the Big History part, we needed to do a quiz after every chapter he taught, there is about 10 quizzes. But you can resubmit it as long as before the deadline. You just need to remember to do it and that's enough.<br /><br />There is a group project which is a debate. Alexis will assign the group for you. Two groups will do a debate which is taped as a video for submission. Individual report is needed. <br /><br />During the course, we need to write 2-3 short essays when Alexis wanted. Usually it is about one particular lecture or a topic he raised in class.",
