Comparative studies on non-human animals and the issue of genetic inheritance of behavior will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on key principles of human nervous system function and how they are reflected in human thoughts and behavior. Key topics covered include the organization of the brain, the visual system, how learning and memory occur in the brain, and the cognitive and behavioral consequences of brain injury and disease.",

            "comment_teaching": "first of all, it is important to note that Maria's accent is really really difficult to understand ðŸ˜‚ So it is lucky that I take this course during the &quot;zoom period&quot;. With the help of zoom subtitle, it is a little bit easier for me to understand what she is saying as you can reloop and slow down the lecture video. So if you need to take this lecture during the face-to-face mode, pls think twiceðŸ˜‰. As her lecture content is not perfectly equal to the textbook content, you must attend her lecture to learn.<br /><br />Back to the main point, I think Maria's teaching is good and fine?! Apart from her accent issue, she is very willing to answer students' questions and listen to our opinion. For instance, right after the midterm, some students stated that she is teaching too fast and she immediately slow down the teaching speed after the midterm. For me, as a student without any biological background really can feel the difference.<br />Also, she is willing to answer questions either in person or through email. ps. i normally email her at the end of every topic (I summarize questions that I hv for every topic), she answers my email quite fast and with proper explanation.<br /><br />However, it is important to note that you only register this course if you are really interested in biological psychology and do not hate biology thing. As this course is really really about biology. If you hate it, it would definitely be torture studying this course. If you are not very interested in biological psychology, pls make sure that you have a biology background, so that you can study this course easily.",
