            "comment_content": "There are 2 mid-term exams and also one final exam.<br /><br />For the first mid-term exam, it is relatively easy. It only concludes the part taught by Prof. Tsim.<br />He highly recommended us to buy the textbook, however, even a year 1 student could find out some misconcepts in the books. I read the whole book seriously and found out that it is time-consuming and also wasting my time, as I have to find the wrong parts in the book and search for the correct stuff. Also, the chapters did tell the students something, but it is incomplete and not really useful, many of the stuff is incomplete. Thus, I really do not recommend any one to buy the textbook and read it. I think search the related topic would be easier to understand. And wikipedia helps a lot.<br /><br />For the second mid-term, it is basically based on the part of Prof. Raymond Wong. The contents are mainly about the history and policy of the patent. There are a lot of terms, definitions and DATES to remember. Remembering all stuff he said in the lecture and also in the notes would be good for exam. So if you really want to choose this course, make sure that you really have a good memory of it.<br /><br />For the final exam, it contains 3 parts. 2 for Prof. Raymond Wong's part and 1 for Prof, Joseph Wong's part. For the first 2 parts, it consists of a lot of T/F questions and LQ. Many part of the T/F question is tricky and many of them involves NUMBERS and DATES. So it was really difficult. And Prof. Joseph Wong's part, the first part of the paper is fill in the blanks, and the second part is MCQs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fill in the blanks part, some of them are not mentioned in the lessons nor on the student's version ppt. So, I have no idea what was happening in some of the question. And as I recalled, one of the fill-in-the-blank question is asking the name of the bacteria, which is Bt bacteria. Although he did mention the Bt bacteria and its full name in his lectures, however, I have no idea that the long scientific name would be in one of the spelling question, so I did not get the mark. Although some parts of the MCQs were not mentioned in the lectures, but it is relatively easy if you have do some research on the topics in your spare time.<br /><br />This is so far the worst course I have ever enrolled in.",
            "comment_teaching": "For Prof. Tsim's part, he teaches with the ppt and sometimes, he wrote something on the whiteboard and asked the students sitting in the front row to answer his questions. His teaching is clear and easy to understand. However, if you don't think to be asked to answer questions or you found that you might sleep in the middle of the lecture, do not sit on the first row.<br /><br />For Prof. Raymond Wong's part, he doesn't use any powerpoint, all he shown is the pdf he distributed in the beginning of the lesson and the notes he wrote on the whiteboard. He used the whole whiteboard to write the stuff, so if you want to take notes, find a seat that could see the whole whiteboard. Also, his handwriting is not really good, so, it is somehow difficult for me to see what he was writing. His teaching is clear, so I think his teaching is okay.<br /><br />For Prof. Joseph Wong's part, I have no idea what he is doing actually. Sometimes, he was late for the lectures, and in most of the time, he was not teaching anything at all. As I recalled, many time he stopped in the middle of his lecture he stopped and told us that it is the wrong powerpoint and he would like to find the newest version. And this takes lots of time, and sometimes, he cannot find the correct powerpoint and seemed not willing to continue the lecture. Also, the powerpoint that is uploaded on Canvas is known as the &quot;Old version&quot;, the powerpoint slide is totally a mess, the situation is like this: Prof. Wong shows the powerpoint with the projector, on slide 12, you find out that the one he is showing is totally different from yours. Thus, you try to find the that powerpoint slide in your version, and it is slide 34 in the student version powerpoint. And two slides later, all of this happens again. And at the moment that you eventually find that powerpoint slide, he finished his elaboration and explanation. And sometimes, you could not find the powerpoint slide that he is showing at all. And when you want to take a picture of it, he stops you and told you not to. As he is going through the powerpoint too fast, for some slides, he skipped or go to the next slide before you could finish reading all of the words or diagram there. Furthermore, you could find most of the slide that should have diagrams or flowchart on it remains empty, there is only the title. Some happens as he claimed that using the pictures online would not be legit, but he could actually post the website link there so that we could reach it. It would be so much easier for us. <br />Furthermore, sometimes he told us he actually had no idea what that is and how does it works in the middle of the lecture, and he asked us not to ask questions. Even if you do, he would tell you that you don't need to know the answer, it is just a introductory course.<br />To conclude, it is like 80% of the lesson time you are not learning, as you are too busy to find the correct powerpoint slide and listening to something not-related. <br /><br />Actually there is also a doctor for teaching support, Doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;Leung. The powerpoint she made for the lesson of Prof. Joseph Wong is wonderful. It is a pity that he only showed it for at most 2 minutes (the powerpoint actually has many slide). I wished that we actually could have a chance to read that.",

His teaching pace was so slow at first, and right before the midterm he immediately rushed all the way to finish 2 whole chapters in merely 2 lessons. And attending his lectures is useless - better rely on self-study to survive in the first midterm. However, one thing he isn't that bad is that he conducts the lectures in a more interactive way than the other 2 professors. He might sometimes ask students sitting in the front rows questions, so get prepared if you sit in the front rows.<br /><br />Prof Joseph Wong - E<br />Rubbish. Nobody knows what7 he says. PowerPoints are messy. Nobody knows what the heck he's doing. Refuses to reply emails of inquiry from students cuz he's &quot;busy&quot;.<br /><br />Prof Raymond WK Wong - B<br />Quite a lot of students dislike his teaching style - he writes lots and lots of things on the blackboard and you've to write you notes fast enough so that you can catch up on his teaching. However, if you're hard-working and if you can follow his pace, you'll be fine on the final exam.",

But for those who have good memory should think this midterm was easy. He asked questions like the pros and cons of using E. coli for protein expression, different protein purification techniques, applications of PCR, what makes a good vector in recombinant DNA, etc. Make sure you master these topics well or you'll end up in a disaster like me.<br /><br />The second midterm is just multiple choices. Easy for those who can still pay attention in the professor's cr*ppy lectures. Try to identify the important concepts in the lectures.<br /><br />The final exam is a mind blower. If you've skipped all the lectures of WK Wong you'll surely be fucked up. But if you've revised thoroughly what he's taught in the lectures, you'll find the final exam is basically just a recap of what he's mentioned. He's asked questions such as the components of fermentor that improve aeration, the calculation of specific growth rate in time course study, the difference between gram +ve bacteria and gram -ve bacteria, advantages of using E. coli for secretion, etc. There is A LOT to revise, and make sure you leave enough time to revise for WK Wong's part.<br /><br />Grading is not that bad. I screwed up the first midterm (scoring merely 0.46SD above mean, scored 1.1SD above mean in the second midterm, and I haven't received my marks for the final exam.<br /><br />💯 Final grade: A-.",

Don't know why.<br /><br />Karl Tsim: some basics, you may already have learnt them before. You may treat this part as an outline of the course. For DSErs, biology E4 biotech overlaps with half of this part. One of the lectures invited guest Rocky Law, who talked about the biotech industry and current investors. Quite interesting part overall.<br /><br />J Wong: Nothing to say<br /><br />W.K. Wong: He will teach the parts taught by KT and J Wong again but in details. Main topics listed below.<br />- Plasmids &amp; Transformations<br />- ELISA<br />- Polyclonal &amp; Monoclonal Antibodies<br />- DNA sequencing (Gilbert's method, Sangar's method and modern machine sequencing)<br />- Southern blotting<br />- Shotgun cloning<br />- Oligonucleotide site-specific mutagenesis<br />- PCR and mutagenesis within PCR<br />- Gene therapy, ECS<br />- Hourglass model<br />- Time-course studies and how to get to commertial scales<br />- IP protection",
            "comment_teaching": "KT: He is not only a scientist but also an entrepreneur. He teaches in an entrepreneur way. Perhaps he knew that everyone should be 70% familiar with the content of his part before he taught (you should be in biotech major or related if you are reading this), he switches to teaching you how to earn money from people with the examples coming from the textbook. The slides are from Pearson btw.<br /><br />J Wong: Does he know what he is talking about in class? He is even worse than Avery Ching. His ppt is the worst I have ever seen. Some slides are blank. He seems to have more slides than us. He broke up the lecture slides to parts, then in order to search for the correct ppt, he wastes time in class. He keeps talking the same thing, then switches to another suddenly with no transition or explanation. He would stop talking to find some pen from his bag, then write some meaningless terms on the whiteboard that are shown on his slides. I first saw his face at the midterm exam when he took off his mask for a second to use the walkie talkie, he was always wearing a mask. In fact, I couldn't even concentrate in class because of his style of teaching and I decided to study myself.<br /><br />W.K Wong: The best lecturer in the course, he is really teaching something useful. Explains things clearly and also listens to questions. Topics are clearly mentioned so there is no problem following. Every single thing he said is concise and to the point. It is an amazing experience to learn not only very theoretical stuff like the biotech in high school and KT's part, but practical procedures, result interpretation and how to start a biotech career. He uses whiteboard though, no notes. Try copying everything he said and wrote and do sit in the front row (unless your eyesight is good). His words aren't beautiful anyways.<br />PS WK Wong is very rich. He is one of the pioneers in the world to mass produce authentic bFGF, put those in cosmetic products and has his own company.",

The question will ask, for example, list 5 applications of PCR. Then there is a slide in the notes about the applications of PCR. Or, match the fields of biotechnology with what they do. There is a slide listing those relationships. There are a total of around 300 slides. Try memorize all the key terms. PS me=97%<br /><br />J Wong's: 30 MCQ, rubbish content. Asking where the GM tomato was harvested? Which animal is the first GM animal? And those 30 MCQs carry 33% of your grade...<br /><br />WK Wong: Real knowledge test. The majority tests the concepts so obviously given that you have prepared but the remaining really requires you to think. Just don't miss anything in your notes and don't skip any lectures. You do need to spell out the terms.",

At least his ppt are more readable and he is more engaged in teaching.",

Personally, I don't find knowing the number of genes in the human genome and the sales of salmons especially useful.<br /><br />Hirano's assessment is more normal and requires certain level of understanding. Apart from the assessment, he has created a spreadsheet for students to raise and answer questions (2 at maximum). Depending on the quality, he will award you with 5% - 20% bonus, which will be DIRECTLY added to your 3rd assessment score, e.g 70/100 with a 30% bonus = 100/100.<br /><br />My score fyi:<br />1st - 64% (Mean: 59.9%, SD: 18.0%)<br />2nd - 68% (Mean: 66.5%, SD: 12%)<br />3rd - 90% + 30% bonus = 100% (Stats not issued, but many got 100% due to bonus)<br />Final grade: B+",
            "comment_workload": "No workload. <br />If you want to score high, my advice is to revise every small details in Tsim's ppt carefully and grab an online E-book for Wong's part. Otherwise, you can't even do revision with Wong's fragmented ppt. For Hirano's, having the bonuses is a must to secure your score. <br /><br />Good luck to BIOT students who are required to take this course.",

He sometimes included Cantonese, which makes it rather difficult for non-locals to understand. However, it was interesting to hear about his experience with cooking salmon in the UK.

            "comment_content": "General:<br />All 3 instructors covered different topics. However, some of the topics were the same. So sometimes you had to listen to the same thing 3 times, which was kind of useless. <br /><br />Tsim:<br />His part covered many techniques of biotechnology. Content-wise, I think this part was the most useful. However, since those were just techniques it could be very boring. Tsim also had the largest amount of content among all 3 instructors. This made his part very tedious. <br /><br />Joseph Wong:<br />His part was the most bizarre thing I have encountered in UST. His content was so unorganized. Sometimes he talked about viruses, and then he talked about genetics. The next day he could be talking about aquatic biotechnology and plant technology. While it seemed to be more interesting than Karl's part, the things Joseph Wong talked about were so strange that you won't even understand why they were there. For example, he talked about different kinds of fish in aquatic biotechnology. But he did not talk about them because there are different properties when using different fishes. He talked about them because of whatever reasons. He did not talk about the properties of different fishes. He only talked about their names. Then what could you learn from this apart from some scientific names of some fishes you see on your dining table? Stuff like this happened all the time throughout his part. So, yeah. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Hirano:<br />His part was way more interesting than the other two. Maybe because he is in the neuroscience field, the things he talked about were more intriguing. The things he talked about made sense. You get to know the why and what and the connection between different topics.",
            "comment_teaching": "General: <br />All of them read from their PowerPoint most of the time. So in my humble opinion, there is no reason to attend the lectures if you read through the PowerPoint. If the teaching made me think of this, that means the teaching quality was bad. There was simply no incentive for you to attend the lectures. <br /><br />Tsim:<br />He usually taught by reading the PowerPoint from the publisher. However, given the enormous amount of content he had to teach, he skipped so many things that were supposedly included in the exam. However, he liked asking questions to students. So there were some kind of interactions if that's what you care about. <br /><br />Joseph Wong:<br />How do I begin? He got dyslexia or something like that. So he has to be very good at researching to get to this position. Although he may be very good at researching, his teaching ability is in Bikini Bottom and you can even see Spongebob and Patrick there. What a mess. He made his slides. However, I don't know whether it was because he had dyslexia or he was so bad at teaching, his slides demonstrated some of the worse possible uses of presentation tools I have seen in my entire life. He put so many graphs and photos in the slides without illustrations. He shared his slides in a strange way that somehow 2 slides made up one page of the document, which made it difficult to revise.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about things not included in his slides and those things may be tested as well. The worse part was he talked about his stuff that was unrelated to the exam. And he did that a lot. Therefore he fell behind the schedule and guess what? He skipped the important things that would be in the exam and continued his adventure with salmon. If you care about your GPA, this would be one of the biggest hurdles you have to overcome. <br /><br />Hirano:<br />He was enthusiastic about the things he taught. His slides were clear and organized. He enjoyed interacting with students as well. He organized a workshop to share his journey of becoming a scientist. The point is he did it after the final. So it would not affect students when they were studying for the exams. He is the best among the 3 in terms of teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "General: The grading was between ok and good. The grading is possibly the best part of this course. Be aware that the official name of the exams is &quot;assignment&quot;. There were 3 exams, one for each instructor.<br /><br />First Learning Assessment:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26%<br />Second Learning Assessment:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30%<br />Third Learning Assessment:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44%<br /><br />Tsim (first):<br />His part was fairly easy when compared to the things he taught in class. His exam mainly asked about the names of different techniques instead of the process or rationale. Therefore, as long as you have studied, his part would not be that difficult. <br /><br />Joseph Wong (second):<br />His part was the most difficult. Apart from the terrible teaching quality, his part covered things that were not taught in lectures. Moreover, some of the questions were so strange. Therefore, it is very hard to prepare for his part. Also, his exam only had 25 questions. Therefore, each question was very &quot;valuable&quot; in terms of your score. So it is important to revise earlier for his part. <br /><br />Hirano (third):<br />His part was a bit different than the other two instructors. His grading scheme consisted of 3 parts: asking questions, answering questions, and final exam. For the first two parts, all you have to do is type 2 questions in a shared excel file and answer 1 question raised by others by making a 6-7 pages PowerPoint (including cover page and references). So basically everyone got full marks for the first 2 parts. The last part would be a normal exam. However, the maximum attainable score of all 3 parts exceeds 44%. Therefore, as long as you do the first two parts and do not mess up the final exam, you are almost guaranteed to get full marks in Hirano's part.<br /><br />My score:<br />Tsim: 91/100<br />Joseph Wong: 23/25<br />Hirano: full mark (44%)<br />Grade: A+",

It's really chaotic for many students since not everyone can get used to this way of delivery. Maybe watching the recordings and skipping the lectures is a better choice since you can immediately replay for what you dont understand. <br /><br />For Yuki, the teaching was pretty good.

            "comment_teaching": "Karl Tsim's teaching was acceptable and what he taught wasn't hard at all. The downside was he went through 90+ slides every single lesson, so don't expect him to go in depth into any topics.<br /><br />Joseph Wong is terrible at teaching. He was always late to class. The lecture notes he referred to in class were messy, making everything he said hard, if not impossible to follow. Most of the time he stuttered very badly and had completely no idea what he was teaching. I bet a kindergarten teacher can teach way better than him. <br /><br />WWK was ok but the fact that he still uses solely the whiteboard to teach just pisses me off, you have sit on the front few rows every lesson to be able to see whatever he writes on the whiteboard. That said, you can see him put in quite a lot of efforts into explaining the theories behind the groundbreaking discoveries.",
            "comment_grading": "Karl Tsim's exam: MCQs + Short questions<br />Memorise key terms, people who scored badly didn't bother to memorise key terms. Also, forget about revising the lecture notes delivered by the guest lectures, they won't be tested.<br /><br />Joseph Wong's exam: MCQs<br />His lecture notes are an utter mess. Get them organised and you'll score above average.<br /><br />WWK's exam: Matching + MCQs + Short questions + 1-2 calculation question/s<br />He tricked everyone by asking things like which year were some discoveries discovered and who discovered this and that. Don't forget to revise the details of the discoveries.",

            "comment_teaching": "The teachers were terrible, the first lecturer literally used someone else's slides and just read off them. He tried to be funny but he really wasn't. Using some one else's slides was good for us because that meant that the content was understandable and well put. <br /><br />The second lecturer had the worst slides I have ever seen, they were just blank slides with a few words and images. You had to research topics on your own to understand the topics.<br /><br />The last lecturer was the prof in charge of this course, WONG, Wan Keung. I actually enjoyed his lectures more than the others, I felt like i actually learnt something.This guy pulled no punches. You have to attend every lecture because this guy write on the board. To keep up you have to constantly jot down what he writes on the board and what he says. This guy was the toughest because he went into a lot of detail. His slides were just topic names and pictures and dates, nothing he said was actually on the slides. Which means in order to pass his test you have to attend lectures.",

I havent done fill in the blanks since primary school. It was so vague, the answer is so relative. I cant use the word ridiculous enough to describe this course. <br /><br />But that all being said, the tests were relatively easy if you knew your content, which means the mean was usually around 50-70. I just went through the slides and attended the lectures here and there and it was enough to get me an -A.",

The questions in midterm is not deep at all, very straight forward, just memorization is needed.<br /><br />For Prof Joseph Wong part, I could hardly understand what he said and was very difficult to catch up. His ppt is extremely simple, sometimes just few words and pictures. Attending the lectures doesn’t really help your understanding, but I would recommend you to attend the lectures. You often need to find cohesion between his ppt slides yourselves. His delivery was not clear and sometimes discussed thing out of the ppt. However, his mid-term is quite straight forward if you really get familiar with his ppt content. Most of them were included in the lectures. It consists of MCQs only but memorizing all the details in his ppt is not an easy job. <br /><br />For Prof Raymond Wong’s part, you have to pay attention throughout his lectures and if you want to have good marks, sit in the front few rows and never skip lessons!!! He wrote contents in the whiteboard. I would suggest you write as much as you can in the notes as sometimes, you don’t know what is happening if you just mark down words on the board. His part is quite clear and detailed which you can learn many. And his final consists of MC, TF, matching and short question, basically all content in lectures. Short question is quite hard to do.

You have to copy them all if you want to get good grade. However, in my opinion, after copying all the things on whiteboard, when you just do revision and look at them, it is not very organized.<br /><br />BTW, the course outline sates that Prof W.K. Wong will teach &quot;Healthcare application&quot;, &quot;Legal and policy issue in biotechnology&quot;, &quot;Ethical issues in biotechnology&quot;. However, in the end, he did teach them, but maybe only account for 10% of his lectures, he just taught other Biotech terms and technique for the remaining 90%. I think the stuffs are quite random for the 90% one. My point is, if you are not teaching the things that stated in the course outline, then what's the point of writing them down?

Honestly, I cannot believe how bad he was teaching. His teaching is very unclear. You may feel hard to listen to him in lessons. His PowerPoint is awful, like he is showing a 90 pages PowerPoint in lesson but you can only obtain a 40 pages PowerPoint on Canvas, those missing slides will make you have a hard time to follow his teaching. Sometimes, in the lesson, he will say he got a wrong version of the PowerPoint, it makes me feel that he is so unprepared for the lessons. Plus, student version of the PowerPoint notes is strange, he will delete some of the pictures, you may even find a slide with one word or a blank slide. BTW, he said he keeps &quot;edit&quot; the notes each year. In the lessons, he always mentions he is unable to answer so many questions from students via email because he is teaching multiple courses, actually, I have never heard about this problem from other professors, or because of your unclear teaching that causes so many students ask you questions?<br /><br />WK Wong: He wrote notes on the whiteboard, just copy them all if you want to have something for revision.

            "comment_teaching": "WORST TEACHING IS UST AS COMPARED TO Avery Ching!!!!!!!<br /><br />Prof. Tsim is better than the other two, he taught the content of midterm 1, the content was focused on the business side in biot. He sometimes made jokes and his voice was strong. At least you won't fall asleep during the lessons. But he often shows off his company and how biot can bring you a bucket of coins. <br /><br />Prof. WK Wong is better than Prof Joseph Wong, his teaching was bad though. His notes just contained the years and the famous scientists' names, and the important discoveries related to those years. You have to sit close to the whiteboard because he would write the extra contents on the board. His handwriting was awful and unclear. The extra contents were messy and disorganized. Sometimes he even drew on the whiteboard which was hard to understand. <br /><br />Finally come to an end, the worst of the worst--------------<br />Prof Joseph Wong. What the f**K was he doing? I don't know! His voice was weak and his English was terrible, he always repeated the same words! He often watched the clock as if he had nothing to teach or had other business that he didn't want to stay with his students which was not respectful. And his notes? (Open the attachment below and you will know deeper.) Rubbish. You will not have any idea what he was trying to express. <br />Sometimes you just got a link in 1 page of ppt, sometimes you got only one word on a page. His ppt will always surprise you, I guarantee. <br /><br />I need to admit that they must be a successful researcher/ entrepreneur but they must be the worst teacher in the education field!",

Although his teaching was worse like hell, his exam was the easiest. All MC, not tricky questions.<br /><br />For final, it was the hardest. It's like what he wrote on the whiteboard were not correlated to the exam. There will be MC, matching, fill in the blanks and long questions. I just used my 9up ability and my short memory to answer the long questions. Trust me, 90% of the students were scratching their head during the exam. Sigh.",
