        "description": "This innovative course explores the music creative process from the perspective of both the composer and performer and seeks to answer the following questions: When we compose, are we composing only or are we also thinking of performance practice? When we perform, either new or old works, are we only performing or are we composing? Course topics include understanding analysis of classical and contemporary music, instruction of the basic craft of composition, and critique of performance practice in relation to music compositional skills. Students should have some background in music with experience performing an instrument and/or experience with music composition. Basic knowledge of music theory, notation, and composition experience is a plus.",
