It's highly recommended to attend her lectures. You'll probably appreciate biological science!<br /><br />Prof. Miller's ppt are chaotic, but he teaches very well and repeats the key points many many many many times. I especially like his part about psychology. It's FANTASTIC. It's better to attend his lectures since you definitely can't catch up if you read ppt only.",

Professor Melody's part is about evolution, classification and the ecosystem.<br />Professor Miller's part is about human physiology.<br />I have studied Edexcel IGCSE biology and some content of the course is actually harder. Though the overall difficulty is still quite low, considering it's just a introductory course.",

All 3 profs have good accent and can explain things in a clear and concise way.<br /><br />Prof Wu just repeat the content of the ppts and can be quite boring for some people. It's fine for me though. I can understand what he taught during lectures and that's the most important thing. He is quite friendly so if you have any questions feel free to ask him.<br /> <br />Prof melody explains things in a more interesting and funny ways and it is quite fun to attend her lecture. Her ppts are well organised and is easy to read. She's more like a high school teacher than a professor to me, which is very nice.<br /><br />Prof Miller is very passionate in teaching. The part he teaches is the hardest among the 3 parts but he explains it really well. You may not understand it very well the first time but after reviewing the lecture recording, you should be able to understand it perfectly. However, his ppt is chaotic. No jokes. My brain hurts from reading the ppt. He's still a great prof though.",

Prof Wu's part and the first ppt of Prof Melody will be tested in the first midterm. The midterm is actually quite hard. Pay attention to EVERY DETAIL in Wu's ppt. For example, what is mol, how do amino acid form bonding with each others. EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE AND PICTURE IS IMPORTANT. Melody's part is easier and is more straightforward, just revise it normally and you'll be ok.<br />2. The final exam is a cakewalk. Prof miller and Melody's part is in the final exam. The questions are easy and not tricky at all, unlike the midterm. Remember to memorise the name of the important scientists mentioned in miller's ppt. At least 2 to 3 questions will be related to this. You don't wanna lose these valuable marks. For melody's parts, do not need to memorise the details of the pictures. Just study what she mentioned in lecture and it should be fine.<br />3. Use a at least 3 days to studied for both the midterm and final. Even though the content is not hard there are lots of stuff to memorise. You DO NOT want to finish studying it within a day. I drank 4 cans of red bull and pull an all-nighter studying. Trust me, you do not want to experience this feeling.<br />4. Make sure you review the lecture recording when studying. They're super helpful!<br /><br />If you are willing to put in effort and study for a long enough time, you'll get an A+. 100%. Just memorise everything on the ppt and you can get good grade.",
            "comment_workload": "Other than test and exam, there is zero workload.<br />It seems very good, isn't it? No, hell no!<br />There is just so much stuff to study and memorise and it's really painful to do so. If you hate memorising stuff, do not reg this course. You'll die. literally.<br />However, if you're good at memorising things and is hard-working, this course is designed for you. Go reg it, you'll not regret studying this course.",

            "comment_teaching": "Melody surely deserve a A in teaching!<br />She teaches the second part of the course. She tries to interact with students and think about different methods for us to memorise and understand the content easier. And she understand that this course is just a cc course so she clearly tell us that which of those content and concept we should understand and memorise and which of those doesnt need to. She tries to keep things simple and interesting so that we could follow her easily. She even specially organized a summary lesson at the last lesson of her session to prepare us for the part during final exam.<br />But i am not giving a A to the overall teaching since Prof. Wu is too boring in his lecturers by just reading his ppt out during classes.<br />While the third lecturer, Prof Miller, is nice and interesting but his teaching is not that on point.",

His teaching is really boring and he only reads the power-points. In addition, he was behind his teaching schedule and had to cut down the syllabus, where those being cut down (e.g. meiosis) are foundational knowledge for chapters afterwards. I had to research the topic myself to fully grasp the concepts. One good thing about Prof. Wu is that his power-points are very clear and I can do revision easily.<br /><br />Prof. Melody and Prof. Miller are in charge for the second half.<br /><br />Prof. Melody is in charge for ecology and biodiversity. Her teaching is very easily understood and are interesting. She often teaches us tricks on how to remember certain terms and shares with us a lot of her appreciation to biology. She also incorporates some games into the lectures. She also often tells us which parts are being tested and which parts aren't. Her teaching is overall very good and she made me become more interested in biological sciences.<br /><br />Prof. Miller's lectures are so-so. His lectures are less organised but kind of intriguing - feels more like a talk than a lecture. One point to note is that you have to review his lecture videos for some main points as some pages in the power-point will only be shown in his lectures. Also remember to memorise the names of some of the major scientists he mentioned.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is fine. This course seems less competitive compared to other courses in UST. Prof. Melody has said that she will not be too harsh on grades as she stresses on the appreciation of biological sciences but not the knowledge of them.<br /><br />Exams are non-cumulative, meaning materials tested in midterm will not be tested in finals.<br /><br />Midterm: 38/45 Mean: 31.9<br />Final: 43/50 Mean: 36.9<br />Final grade: A-<br /><br />No attendance.",

The best thing about this course is that all three professor understand that this is a common core, and will try their best to include hints on which parts are important and which parts are not for the examination. <br /><br />Professor WU's style of teaching is slightly monotonic and arguably boring. However, I enjoy parts covered by him as I find them quite interesting. It is important to pay attention to every single piece of detail for his part, both in the lecture notes, and in his lectures if you are aiming for an A+(yes, even the most ridiculous parts).<br /><br />I especially enjoy Mrs. LEUNG's grace in teaching. She is compassionate in explaining key concepts as she understands that her part requires deep understanding and not just memorization. The questions she prepared for the exams are relatively straightforward and simple.<br /><br />Professor Miller is a very interesting person with an equally interesting british accent. He includes thoughtworthy researchers and their research both in the field of science and psychology in his parts. Professor Miller will often dictate what will appear in the exams and what will not.",

However, it is important not to underestimate his part as it is the most difficult in the mid term.

Professor Wu most of the time read from the PPTs, but he explained concepts very well, both in class and after class. <br /><br />Dr. Leung was a kind of exam-oriented person. She usually said, &quot;It doesn't matter as it won't appear in exams&quot;. She did revision with us before the exams but that's the trick. Actually, I found that most of the stuff she said is important did not appear on exams. She sometimes asked some minor questions from her notes. <br /><br />Professor Miller is a very cheerful man and he explained every concept very well. He repeated one concept for more than ten times in one lecture and tried to impress us. The questions asked by him in the exam are quite straightforward and those questions are concepts that he emphasized in class.",

How tf r we suppose to know the answer 0-0}<br /><br />-Dr melody's lectures are pretty fun. She tries to make the lectures more interactive (e.g: uses hand gestures, let us play a game to guess what animal the other team is describing, putting a pinecone in water and later show us the state of it again {experiment :D} etc ) Imo its much less stressful than Prof Wu's lectures and is easy to get what she's saying. Her powerpoints are pretty organized and it makes revision easier so &lt;3 thanks Dr melody <br /><br />-Prof Miller teaches passionately. He likes to repeat key concepts many times (not just by speaking out loud, but also in ppt which is one of the reasons why his ppts has many many pages, and speaking of ppt, he does excludes certain pages of the ppt he uploads to canvas, so remember to attend his lectures/ watch the lecture videos).
