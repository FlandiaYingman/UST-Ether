        "description": "Environmental politics is a distinctive field of study within social science. This course critically examines the many environmental ideas, actors and institutions, as well as their dynamics in shaping collective decisions at national and global levels. The first part of the course presents the competing theoretical frameworks for thinking about the environment. The second part discusses the major forms of collective action in environmental decision-making. The third part analyses governments' policy responses to environmental issues under the context of capitalist economy and liberal democracy. Students benefit from the perspectives into managing environmental sustainability through democratic politics and reflecting on the relationship between nature and society.",
