        "description": "This course aims to cultivate students’ systematic and critical thinking about science, technology, innovation, and society, especially in light of the transition from traditional China to contemporary China. Differing from the usual courses focusing on this subject, this course will take a social and critical approach, enabling students to understand and analyze the social, political, and cultural preconditions and impacts of scientific and technological development. By the end of the course, students should understand the significance of the social, cultural, and political preconditions underlying scientific and technological innovations and be able to gauge the impact of those innovations. They should also be able to systematically analyze the factors that make innovation significant and use this analysis to critically examine the development of science and technology over the course of China’s history.",

            "comment_content": "The course consisted of 4 online modules which included lecture videos, slides and quizzes. After the completion of these 4 modules, the professor gave in-person lectures to wrap up the course. When the online modules are ongoing, one class per week is dedicated as a 'tutorial', wherein you are expected to apply what you have learnt from the modules to case studies that the TAs will introduce and discuss.",
            "comment_teaching": "For most of the course, the professor was not in lessons and we would only see him in the online modules. During that time, TAs Cassy and Elizabeth would conduct our tutorials. They were exceptional; they conducted the classes with a certain level of enthusiasm that rubbed off on the students. I would say that one of the plus points of the course was the TAs. <br /><br />Towards the end of the course, Professor Sharif conducted in-person lectures. I can confidently say he is one of the best educators I have ever encountered. His way of teaching and presenting ensures you're always attentive and intrigued, and you definitely will not get bored in his lessons.",

Every person in your group will receive the same grade.<br /><br />Grading (in my view) was completely fair and as long as you put in an appropriate amount of effort you will get an A-range.",
            "comment_workload": "Given that there are no exams for this course, grading falls entirely on the work you do throughout the semester, so you will tend to be a little more thorough with your work during the semester. <br /><br />While overall the workload was quite manageable, there may be times when there is a lot to do because of the number of online lectures to watch, and the fact that an essay is due every 2 weeks.",
