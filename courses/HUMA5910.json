        "description": "In this course, we will explore classic questions in the philosophy of religion from a comparative and intercultural perspective. We will examine topics such as the scope and limits of religious experience and argumentation, the relationship between ethics and religion, the existence and nature of God and the soul, the problem of evil and suffering, and conceptions of salvation and existence of after death. This course will involve a comparative and intercultural approach to Eurasian traditions, drawing on atheistic, Buddhist, Christian, Confucian, Daoist, Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish philosophical sources.",
