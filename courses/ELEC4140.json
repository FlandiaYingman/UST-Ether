        "description": "This course begins with an overview of some fundamental information theory related to data compression. Lossless techniques, including Huffman/arithmetic coding, LZ coding, and their applications; and lossy techniques, including quantization (both scalar and vector), transform coding, predictive coding and their applications will be discussed. Several international standards (such as GIF, and JPEG for image coding, and LPC vocoder and its variants) will be discussed.  Programming exercises on various image and speech codes will be an integral part of this course.",
