Which means you have to be really precise. <br /><br />During the online class, there would have in-class polling for extra bonus. It is random, and max. 2 marks. Each polling would get 0.5 marks. <br /><br />Really, everything is sooooooooo easyy, just attend all the classes is okay for u to get at least b range.
