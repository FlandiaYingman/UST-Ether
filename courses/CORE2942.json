        "description": "We start with one simple question: is there something special or unique about a sustainability mindset that provides us better insights and tools for solving long-term or systemic problems? In this hands-on class we first start by challenging the traditional methods for making decisions, recognizing some typical thinking “blunders” that result in non-sustainable outcomes. We then explore several conceptual tools and skills that can help us overcome these mistakes like systems thinking, future thinking, strategic thinking, values thinking, and complex problem solving. We then test out these mental tools by working together to develop a range of potential solutions to some of Hong Kong’s most difficult sustainability challenges. This is a flipped classroom – using online learning modules in place of lectures – with class time dedicated to theme based discussions and group exercises.",
