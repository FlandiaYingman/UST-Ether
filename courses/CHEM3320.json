I am confident that if he takes his ppt to Lang 3022, he will get a D range or even F. The only good(?) thing is that he can explain something well(?). (Unfortunately, he seldom releases his recording and forces us to choose either attend his lecture or learn by ourselves)<br /><br />To survive, you MUST JOT NOTES in his ppt, as the material he covered but not in the lecture notes WILL APPEAR IN THE EXAM (e.g. how to calculate the ratio of the peak height of MS, how to work out the molecular formula from peaks of ESI, etc).<br /><br />If you still find it confusing, you can borrow the textbook to have a look. The textbook explanation is much better than Prof. Wu's. However, you will find that Prof. Wu does cut a lot of content from the very wordy textbook. You had better find an online version.

Very easy to fall asleep, make sure you keep yourself busy to stay awake. <br /><br />I adopted the suggestions by other contributor's @USTSPACE saying that it will be better to write your own notes, which I think was REALLY helpful. Given that the PPT Prof. Wu provided was lack of word/descriptions/titles etc. My practices was to type down his descriptions/remarks/notes next to the PPT slides for my revision. DON'T just rely on his PPT notes, its messy and full with pictures that have no explanations. <br /><br />I also tried reading the textbook, but the e-version textbook I got has low resolutions. And Prof.Wu's PPT uses diagrams that cannot be found on the textbook, I found this method not effective for me and started to listen to his lessons carefully and make my own notes. <br /><br />He sometimes uses the whiteboard to explain things, which can be hardly seen via zoom recordings. And the curser DISAPPEARED in the zoom recordings, so all I can hear was &quot;use this to do this&quot; with a bunch of ??? in my head. Was grateful that I attendant most of the lectures.",
