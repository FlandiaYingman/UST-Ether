            "comment_teaching": "A for amazing my friends. Professor Lin teaches chemistry in the most intuitive way possible; this man literally compared molecules to people with different personalities. It was one of the very few courses that I was genuinely excited about in my first semester at HKUST. His teaching style is basically showing his PPT slides and making notes on them using his mouse, which is a very good way to teach chemistry in my opinion, because it actually allows students to understand step by step - instead of just memorizing some reactions or molecules. The only negative is his accent - it can take a while to understand his accent, but once you get used to it, you'd be fine. Also, just a note, while some people prefer asking questions during lecture time, I suggest that you don't, because sometimes he wants to finish a certain section in time and doesn't answer your questions in full details, so it would be better to save them for another time (ex. the weekly Q&amp;A session).",
            "comment_grading": "I remember how I almost cried after seeing my 56% on mid-term - his exams are certainly not easy and require a real understanding of the material, not just pure memorization. With the two assignments averaging at 80% and the final at 70%, I managed to scratch an A-. This man cares more about students learning than their grades so the curve is pretty nice. Just ask him after lectures if you do have questions and you will do just fine.",
            "comment_workload": "Almost no workload apart from the two assignments. But please take my advice to study at least an hour each week so that you know what is going on. If you choose to ignore any of the lectures, you will most likely suffer when you listen to the next one, because many things are built on each other.",

When you go into the classroom, you will realise that only ~50-60% of students attend his lecture. I attended his lecture mostly just because I don't want to have attendance points deducted!!!

I studied both exams the night right before. Such preparations were merely enough for me to pass the exams -- lots of misconceptions were still not clarified.

            "comment_content": "The first half of the semester (Sept + Oct) covered molecular orbitals and solid-state chemistry while the second half (Nov) covered Lewis acid &amp; bases and also stereochemistry.<br /><br />For the MOs, of course you need to learn how to draw them. <br />The most important new thing is the ligand group orbitals, which describe groups of surrounding atoms by 'in phase' and 'out of phase' combinations. The key to master LGOs in this course is to know how to project the LGO to a single orbital (knowing the shape). The number of LGOs is exactly the number of surrounding atoms.<br />The second would be hybridization, introduced in 1030. Just knowing that if the energies of the s and p are close enough and they have the same geometry they would hybridize will be more than enough.<br /><br />Solid state chemistry is rather easy in this course, there are several common structures (like ccp bcc hcp sc) in the course, make sure you understand them. If you don't, memorize them. Count and draw the ions and holes several times while studying, try to think about why there is a hole instead of memorizing the position of the hole. <br /><br />For Lewis acid and base, you need to know several things, including what is meant by Lewis AB, factors affecting solubility and stability of AB adducts. You may also want to know how to illustrate AB adducts properly. Bronsted-lowry AB are also tested so be prepared.<br />For your reference, Bronsted-lowry acid refers to proton donor while Lewis acid refers to electron acceptor.<br /><br />Stereochemistry is the most challenging. This course includes point groups in symmetry and coordinations.<br />Point groups may seem difficult, because you cannot memorize all of them. There are several 'bigger' classification, namely linear, low symmetry, C, D and TOI. Classifying molecules to these groups may help assign point groups.<br />Normal modes are more difficult but may be easier as long as you recognize that the number of stretching nodes are the same as the number of sigma bonds. The rest is like LGO projections.<br />Isomerism: high school stuff. They ask to list out all geometrical isomers and enantiomers, very easy anyways.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Lin teaches well, I guess?<br /><br />He teaches in an interactive way, I never feel bored in his class. However for some difficult or abstract stuff he can't explain them well. I guess it's a kind of sense? Example: What are hard acid --&gt; You touch the atom its so hard. <br /><br />Well indeed, metal ions on the lefter side of the periodic table are harder as they have high charge density. You think of a soft acid of having a 'bouncy electron cloud'.<br /><br />The point is if you think like what he does then it is great, but if you cannot follow him then you probably need to revise or seek help from the ta. Try your best to think like Lin.<br /><br />Nicest TA i've ever seen (ZhangZ). I sent him an email the evening asking for some help, he replied me the night at 10pm with all those software drawn pictures and paragraph long USEFUL replies. Really nice.<br /><br />Lin will sometimes do questions wrongly, tell him if he did.",

Just chill.<br /><br />If you did NOT attend the lecture, the powerpoint will suck and you cannot revise anything but to watch the videos. Only by listening to what Lin says will the ppt be useful.<br /><br />Past paper provided, but as ppt slide format discussed in class. No service to those who don't come to class or watch videos.",

If you were absent without sickness, he refused to let you know your mark. <br /><br />I was absent for the lesson when he displayed our marks. I asked my classmate on the following day whether he saw my mark, he said he could not see it. I got to email Dr. Lin and lied to him I was sick that day, after which he was barely willing to let me know my mark.<br /><br />For the Final's, we were not even allowed to know. I was below mean (fairly low) by 10.5 marks in the Mid-Term Exam and did not know my mark of the Final Exam. <br /><br />I was eventually given a generous C+ .",

It often just assumes students to follow certain rules, for example, when drawing a MO diagram, they expect you to always put Antibonding at a higher energy level than non-bonding, which is not always true. But they won’t let you explain that you’ve considered other factors and that you’re wrong for this question, and the subsequent question, and the subsequent question too -they just all agree to one convention for the ease of teaching and grading and just stick to that. <br />——<br />Totally not recommended, if you do have to take this for requirements, don’t take it with hope and expectations.<br />After all, this course is not a for-learning course, it’s more a grade-getting course. Or else the prof should have made the exams open book just like ANY other good universities do (literally just name any, I can do that right off my mind rn: Imperial, MIT, Oxford…) oh, and also, it tests factual recall to a certain degree, get ready to brute memorise the coordination number of crystal structure of some salts",
