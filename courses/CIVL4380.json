But it is still a good course to learn the basic concepts about wind induced loadings.<br /><br />By the way, course description mentions wind tunnel test but it was not taught in this semester.",
            "comment_teaching": "Quite good. Prof. Tse explained the concepts clearly, with extra examples and equation deductions not included in lecture slides. He also drew diagrams on whiteboard to better illustrate the concepts.<br /><br />At the beginning of almost all lectures, there was a recap on the content introduced in the previous lecture, so as to keep students on track.<br /><br />RVC recordings were uploaded to Canvas for revision purpose, however, the audio quality was not that good. Sometimes the video and audio were even out of sync. Therefore, attending lectures f2f is recommended.",
