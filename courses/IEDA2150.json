Some of the questions may be a little tricky.<br /><br />Sketchbook: you'll be asked to get a sketchbook, some pencils and a thin pen. You'll be given several sketchbook exercises throughout the semester, which you have to finish in class or at home. Sketchbooks will be collected at the end of the semester (and also once at the start).<br /><br />Labs and presentations<br />For a few consecutive weeks, you'll be given a 3D design 'project' where you'll design a balloon car, a drone and a bicycle/dicycle. You'll be given 1-2 weeks to finish each design, which you'll submit through canvas for the TAs to 3D print. The 3D printed product will be handed to you in a week for you to clean and assemble as you wish before you hand in the final product.<br />Product evaluation presentation: compare and contrast products made for the same purpose (ex: graters, spoons).<br /><br />Project<br />The project is about creating/modifying a new/existing product (your product should not already exist). You'll write a proposal for your product after the professor approved the product. You'll then have to create the product using whatever material you want (you will be reimbursed a certain amount, mine was up to 500HKD). You'll then present your product to the rest of the class on 'product exhibition day' (last day of class), where everyone will grade your product and try them. Afterwards, you'll be asked to write a project report.<br /><br />My PRS were around mean or only slightly above mean on average. My product evaluation presentation was below mean (don't try to do it the night before when you have 2 consecutive morning classes before the presentation day (: ).
