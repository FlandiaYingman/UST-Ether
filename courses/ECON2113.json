Be sure to self-learn the new concepts e.g. oligopoly, monopoly, monopolistic competition... otherwise you'll be miserable in your finals because he doesn't really have time to cover all contents in class.<br /><br />btw, the thing that struggles the most is everything related to margins, e.g. MSC, MSB, MC, MB... he told us that MSB of producing at x+1 unit is = MSB at producing IN x unit, and that MC cannot be used when the table does not tell us is linear. That makes just us soooo confused",
            "comment_teaching": "To do Robin some justice, he is a good person: He is willing to answer your questions by person and via mail (usually within a day, very efficient), and is also glad to take in opinions. <br /><br />However, his teaching is subpar. What he does in lectures is basically reading out the slides. (Robin, if you're seeing this review, please do try to explain more about the fundamental concepts given in the slides first, but not reading out the slides directly...). What is more important is that he should cover more exam-related contents in class because he can't just ask something alien all of a sudden in exams!<br /><br />The tutor, Astor, is very, very, very disastrous. She's even worse than the professor...<br />Maybe she's nice in person, I'll never know because of the online mode, but she's horrible when it comes to teaching: she goes through over-simplistic question types from her so-called 'notes' which even high school students could accomplish and is not useful to us (her notes are all DIRECT copy and pastes from lecture notes, which are of no use at all. Why don't I read the lecture slides then?). <br />Worse still, I can't stand the fact that she spent so much time on unnecessary contents, e.g. how to use camscanner, over-elaborating midterm guidelines page by page... Yes, these information are important, but she needs to know how precious tutorial periods are as there are only less than one hour each week for her to finish a chapter.",

You need at least 70% to get a B and 85% to get an A! I don't know why i could even be in A range, perhaps I was too angry him and revised everything in contents for finals lmao<br /><br />problem sets 20% -&gt;19/20<br />midterm exam 35% -&gt;23/35<br />final exam 45% -&gt;45/45<br /><br />Midterm is still difficult, perhaps Robin thinks that we are capable of it, but as a result, the mean is 60. I got 64, which is still far away from the highest score 8X.<br /><br />I think Robin knows what's going on and decided to grace us with a final of lower difficulty (still hard, but you will know how to do each question if you revise). Otherwise, I'm sure all of my classmates will fuck up and get at most a C.<br /><br />Tips for you if you got enrolled in his course:<br />Read every page of lecture slides and revise all of them EVEN IF HE DIDN'T MENTION IT. For instance, he asked about a unitary elastic curve that passes through origin in 2020 midterm. Actually, supply that passes through origin has Es of 1, and this is quite tricky because it appears in lecture slides and many people neglect it, thinking that they already know all about elasticity from DSE.",

I thought the midterm would be manageable, but then the time is quite tight and u have to do q very fast. Also, one question was like &quot;According to professor yu...&quot; and you have to answer the exact phrase she mentioned in class (5 marks!!). Lesson learnt from this midterm is that you should copy her lecture slides into your cheatsheet using the exact wording. After the midterm, we have more new stuff, and you may want to spend some time to understand the materials. Make sure u attend her classes (or skip the class and watch the video) and listen to her in-class examples. Her final exam question was exactly the same with what she said in class!! In the final exam, many answers were 爛數 :00 (non integer numbers) and you may want to double check to avoid minor calculation mistakes. <br /><br />Even if you didn't get a good score in the midterm, you still can get a good grade by doing well in the final! (in my opinion final is much easier than midterm. Many people left the exam hall early) <br />Add oil and good luck :DD!!!",

            "comment_teaching": "He is a chill and funny person because he always cracks some jokes during his lectures which I enjoy a lot. Also, he often relates economic concepts to his own experiences like he relates the diminishing marginal utility to his experience in being a soldier in South Korea which makes it more understandable. Moreover, he is willing to stay behind to answer questions for one hour because simply it's his office hour and he also encourages interactions on zoom which often encourages to just shout out to answer questions. I think it will be better to attend his lessons face to face. However, at the second half of the lectures, he had missed around&nbsp;&nbsp;three lectures due to his stomach problem and he was in hospital then. So later on he spoke a little but fast on the concepts. But it is manageable because he is very responsible that he uploads extra three zoom recording for us to watch so I can rewatch it many times. Moreover, he skipped teaching monopolistic competition but added some new things that other professors may not teach. For example, the Groves-Clarke Mechanism which is very special and interesting. Also, he teaches game theory the best because he is a game theorist and it is good for someone who wants to know more about game theory. So reg his course if you want to know more about game theory and he can definitely tell you more about that.",
            "comment_grading": "Attendance: 10%(this is a zoom-class and he requires all of us to open our cameras so as long as you attend all lessons, you will get that 10%) <br />Assignments: 15%(1st assignment: 138/140, mean: 131.3, high: 140 <br />2nd assignment: 236/245, mean:230.8, high:245<br />3rd assignment: 120/120, mean:111.1, high:120) <br />Midterm: 30%(100 minutes, me:153/200, mean: 124.7, high: 174)<br />Final: 45%(2 hours, all marks are unknown) <br />Final grade: A+ <br />I think the grading is lenient because he said he would give 25% top an A which it is unusual in ust. For the midterm, it is quite difficult because we are allowed to open book due to having some online exam for some not-in-hk people. It is about the taxi market in Hong Kong with some background information provided so it really tests your understanding. For the final exam, it is also open book because there are still some not-in-hk people. But I would say the final exam is testing your writing speed more than economic thinking because one long question is exactly the same with previous past paper question and the ta has talked about that question during tutorial. Another two long questions are true or false questions with 50 marks each and basically you have to write an essay explaining whether you agree with that statement or not and simply you can just copy the graphs and explanations from the book. The last long question is the standard hw problem question so it is not difficult at all. One reminder for you all is that he won't have MC in his exams because he said that he hates MC and all are long questions. So some who are good at MC should go to other classes.",

He is a nice person that will answer any question that you raise and he is happy to stay behind class to accommodate you . He is also friendly and will chat with students a bit before class. Be prepare for interactions during class.<br /><br />His teaching materials are okay. Just the teaching slides are a bit long and the info are scattered, but does not affect much. He teaches according to the slides so skipping lessons won't affect much. You can always revise by the slides. The assignments are basically practice for mid-term and exam. Overall speaking, he is a very good professor and so far my favourite one.",

Usually 1 assignment per 3 weeks/month. <br /><br />There is only one mid-term and one final. The questions are very similar and sometimes identical to the assignments. So if you know how to nail the assignments you will nail the exams. <br /><br /><br />Prof. Lim Woo Young is a rather casual professor, attendance accounts for only 5%, does not matter much. Just make the professor remember you by asking questions and you will get the 5%.<br /><br />I got 5* in DSE, studied around 6 hours for mid-term and 10 hours for final, finished all assignments. Got an A at last.",

You may read through other comments and find others saying this course is just like a review of what they have learnt and have a minimal workload, but I better recommend you to put very high effort and time in reviewing the notes before lesson and revise it, otherwise you will definitely gonna fail the course! Frankly speaking, for those without DSE and IB Econ background,&nbsp;&nbsp;just like those who didn’t take DSE BAFS to study Acct2010, BE PREPARED AND SUFFER!",

If you ask him questions after the lecture, he is more than willing to answer them for you with the most detailed explanation.

Sometimes if there are some concepts need to be clarify, he will spend more time elaborating them, such as the intuition of P&gt;MR in monopoly. However, he may get overzealous in doing that and start talking the maths behind the intuition. As someone who like Econ, it’s ok but I think others will be confused by that.<br /><br />One big props for Robin is that he is always willing to answer your question whether it’s in person after class or through emails. He also answers question that related to economics but not within the syllabus. So I think he is a very passionate economics teacher.<br /><br />Be aware that the way he speaks in monotonic tone will drive you asleep, and sometimes his pronunciation of some wordings is hard to understand.",

At the end of the semester, I think there're only 20 ppl left in the lecture. The good thing is when she starts teaching non-DSE stuff, she spends more time on explanation and graph sketching, which is quite useful. Compare to lectures, I think tutorials and the TA's notes are much more useful, which summarize the whole chapter in an hour. Also, no attendance is taken for both lectures and tutorials.",

Honestly, it was a little hard to understand his Korean accent in the start, but you usually get used to it. He's an amazing professor and knows how to keep the class engaging and interesting. I usually had to take classes at 6:30am in the morning (time zone difference) but I never felt sleepy during his lectures! <br /><br />The TA was also really nice (Liu Ying). She clarified doubts and concepts very well during her tutorials. She discusses the assignment solutions before the deadline, and that is of great help!",

Professor Lim picks out articles from newspapers and asks questions related to microecon related to actual real life events. Much more application based, which is the best!<br /><br />Midterm: 30%, challenging, same type of questions as the assignment. Super lengthy and hard to finish tho! Mean: 124.5/200<br /><br />Final Exam: 45%, same as above. Don't know the mean.",

Ch.8, 9, and 15 have the most number of new concepts, and Ch. 12-13 have the most extensions. Since only students who have taken Economics will take ECON2113, it is a pretty simple course. Just be sure to expect little differences in question types, concepts, and other items. There are interesting discussion topics and scenarios.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ms. Ding's lessons are very chill. She can talk about a topic for 10-20 minutes without key points (what locals will call 'blowing water'). It is hard to know where the main point is when she does that. If you decide to not pay attention because you already know Economics, it is also not a good choice because you may miss some useful tips, so there is a dilemma. <br /><br />There is a tutorial every week for one day that teaches the computational skills but the TA, Ms. Chen Kwan, tends to overcomplicate things and the skills are not useful in practice. She usually overruns as well.",
            "comment_grading": "Pretty disappointed at the large proportion the final exam takes up given the formidable difficulty. Very risky class to take even if you only want a decent grade. You may be fine if you are an elite.<br />There are 5 online MC quizzes with 20 questions per quiz (actually 6 in total but the first one is not counted towards the final score). Each is 8%. Open-book but there is a very bad system that you must make a choice before proceeding to the next question. You cannot return to the previous question after confirming your answer as well.<br />There are 7 Problem sets in total and the 6 with the highest scores will be counted towards the final score. You already get full marks if you finish them and submit them on time. They take up 9% of the grand total.<br />The final exam is NOTHING LIKE the usual questions! Extremely complicated and advanced compared to the exercises and assignments. Even if you do well in usual quizzes, be prepared for incredibly hard computational questions. Here are the statistics:<br />Average\t52.1/120<br />Median\t48.8/120<br />STDEV\t19.8<br />As you can see, the mean and median are both under 50% of the score. The lowest score is 13/120.<br />Ms. Ding has a fair policy of calculating our final score by shifting more of the weight to the exam or the quizzes according to the method that gives students the higher score out of the two. Details can be found on page 3 in the attached document.",

            "comment_content": "The course is quite easy in the beginning, especially for DSE students. Content for the first few lessons includes basic trade theory (DSE macro stuff), demand and supply, basic concepts etc.. Things get a bit tougher after that, chapters such as utility and indifference curve are completely new to DSE students. Also, note that this course involves a lot of basic calculation when solving problems in assignments and tests (e.g. calculate equilibrium price and quantity with equations of the demand and supply curve), so the question types are quite different from DSE. I do think that it is useful for students that are going to choose econ related majors and provide sufficient basic insight to the microeconomics field.<br />Lecture content are as follows:<br />Chapter 1: What is Economics?<br />Chapter 2: The Economic Problem<br />Part 2: How Markets Work<br />Chapter 3: Demand and Supply (1); Demand and Supply (2)<br />Chapter 4: Elasticity (1)<br />Chapter 4: Elasticity (2)<br />Chapter 5: Efficiency and Equity<br />Chapter 6: Government Actions in Markets<br />Chapter 7: Global Markets in Action (1)<br />Chapter 7: Global Markets in Action (2)<br />Part 3: Households’ Choices<br />Chapter 8: Utility and Demand<br />Midterm Exam covers Chapter 1 through 8 <br />Part 4: Firms and Markets<br />Chapter 9: Possibilities, Preferences, and Choice<br />Chapter 11: Output and Costs (1)<br />Chapter 11: Output and Costs (2)<br />Chapter 12: Perfect Competition<br />Chapter 13: Monopoly<br />Chapter 14: Monopolistic Competition<br />Chapter 15: Oligopoly<br />Part 5: Market Failure and Government<br />Chapter 17: Externalities<br />Part 6: Factor Markets, Inequality, and Uncertainty<br />Chapter 18: Markets for Factors of Production<br />Chapter 19: Economic Inequality<br />Chapter 20: Uncertainty and Information<br />Final exam covers all the topics taught.",

For a Mainland professor, he does not show much of an accent and explains concepts quite well, however, I would say that his lessons are a bit boring.

The final, that was conducted online, was much easier though (weird for an open-book open-Internet exam), questions asked were basic stuff in general.<br />For me, I got 75% in my mid-term and 92% in my final, overall I got 83.7% and it was good enough to grant me an A grade.",

'output and cost': include A LOT OF graphs such that you can perfectly explain how the supply curve and law of supply are derived from (please spend more time on revision)<br />3. 'market structures': perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly, something you have learned in DSE before but more advanced and in-depth<br />4.

In the first lecture, she already said: &quot;attending my lesson or not is your freedom, but I won't provide any make-up sessions because you are responsible for attending the lessons on time&quot;.<br /><br />To be frank, Prof. Ding's teaching is a bit boring. Basically, she directly reads through the lecture notes, which are the powerpoints of the textbooks with maybe some modification made by her. On the other hand, she opts to ask questions frequently. In her lecture notes, there are some MCQs for clarifying concepts, and she may ask the questions through iPRS.<br /><br />Prof. Ding cares a lot about &quot;concepts&quot;. She always asks us to explain certain concepts in a way that &quot;your grandparents would understand&quot;. She tries to use many examples so that students can master the skills, not in a way of memorizing but really understanding it. Sometimes the concepts are very different from the DSE syllabus and you may not be able to digest them within a short time.<br /><br />There is also a tutorial session once per week. I personally think that our TA Peter is quite good. Prof. Ding would ask Peter to explain some difficult concepts in lectures or teach us some mathematical skills that are useful in the course. Peter would give us a handout at the beginning of the tutorial. It contains some key concepts (with explanation) and some simple exercise. Peter would try to discuss and explain all the questions in the handout if possible. He welcomes students asking him questions, although sometimes we may not be able to really solve the problem.",

Besides, she provides 2 grading schemes so that students may still have a chance to get a good grade if they unfortunately missed some quizzes or performed poorly in some quizzes. <br /><br />Components counting towards final grade:<br />Problems Sets, Online Quizzes and Final Exam (will be explained in detail below and in &quot;workload&quot; part)<br /><br />Scheme 1 <br />Problem Sets 9% (1.5%@, counts 6 out of 7)<br />Canvas Online Quizzes 40% (8%@, 5 in total)<br />Final Exam 51%<br /><br />Scheme 2 <br />Problem Sets 9% (1.5%@, counts 6 out of 7)<br />Canvas Online Quizzes 24% (8%@, best 3 out of 5)<br />Final Exam 67%<br /><br />Obviously Prof. Ding provides 2 schemes so that students will not be drastically worse off if they performed poorly in either one of the components.<br /><br />My results: (My final percentage is nearly the same under the two schemes so I use scheme 1 for more information)<br /><br />Problem Sets 9% (full marks, in which everyone do get)<br />Online Canvas Quizzes 33.6%<br />Quiz 1 (Ch. 3-4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17/20, mean 16.5 <br />Quiz 2 (Ch. 5-6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19/20, mean 17.2<br />Quiz 3 (Ch. 7-8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18/20, mean 14.4<br />Quiz 4 (Ch. 10-11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15/20, mean 16.5<br />Quiz 5 (Ch. 12-13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15/20, mean 15.1<br /><br />Final Exam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.6%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(75.77/100, mean 51.5, SD 14.74)<br />(*this year's situation was different from the past, please refer to the &quot;workload&quot; part)<br />Total percentage under scheme 1: around 81.2%<br />Final letter grade: A<br /><br />The highest mark in the final exam was 88.5%, which was one SD higher than my score. Besides, I didn't perform as well as the others in the quizzes because the highest mark for all the quizzes were full mark. However, I still managed to get an A, which was out of my expectation. I would roughly estimate that Prof. Ding has at least given 20% student an A range, which is very generous.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is very light, or even 0 in my opinion. Apart from the lectures and the tutorials, all you need to do is a few problem sets, which contains MCQs and short/long questions related to the latest chapters taught. The &quot;exciting&quot; point is that Prof. Ding said she won't check the answers of your submission, i.e. as long as you upload something, marks will be awarded.<br /><br />The online quizzes are also not as stressful as mid-term exams, because each quiz only contains 20 MCQs, in which you need to finish it within 30 minutes. Each quiz only covers 2 chapters, so you don't need to always keep revising.<br /><br />*Special Arrangement for Final Exam this year<br />The final exam was changed to an online format regarding the fact that the school campus was closed and all in-campus lectures were canceled since early November. <br />The final exam was 130 marks in total, which consists of 20 MCQs (2 marks@each question, 40 in total) and 7 short or long questions (ranging from 8-21 marks each). The exam length was 100 minutes.<br />Although it was called an &quot;online exam&quot;, only the MCQs and first 3 short questions were genuinely online. For the remaining 4 long questions, we needed to write all the answers in a piece of paper, then take a photo of the answer sheet with your student ID card, finally upload the .jpg (only .jpg is accepted) in Canvas.<br />To be honest, I think that the time allowed was not sufficient in the final exam. For example, we needed to finish an 8-12 mark short question within 5 minutes (including time for uploading the image). I was not able to finish some of the first few questions as a result.<br /><br />Up until when this review was written, I still haven't received any information about the specific scores of each question that I got in the final exam (except for MCQs). Peter only announced the total score after translating the exam in a 100-marks total.",

However, some of the same concepts taught in this course and IAL now have graphical applications (for example, the price effect of price change of goods which separates into substitution effect and income effect will be illustrated with indifference curves and budget line) and some same concepts don't require graphs (for example the kinked demand curve is not taught for the oligopoly chapter). It also has more but basic maths used as IAL doesn't really teach econ maths.<br />Chapters:<br />0. Introduction<br />1.

Should go through as although the things taught in the tutorials do show up in the final.",

This gives you an idea of how adequate the duration is.<br /><br />In terms of the difficulty, it is not that difficult at all, with sufficient revision and practice with past papers and assignments. For the final exam, its difficulty is similar to the homework given. One of the exam questions is literally identical to the last set of homework, so make sure you pay more attention to those. <br />In the end I got an A.

However professors don't upload and don't allow us to look at the solution (what a stupid idea) and you need to take pictures quickly by your phone. Make sure you attend tutorials and understand the solution as the questions would appear in exams.<br /><br />You can just simply attend all the tutorial sessions but skip all the lectures.",

In particular, 2 80-mark questions and 1 40-mark question. Normally, in his mindset, there is only total right or total wrong.

Maybe this is my problem. Believe it or not, he explained every topic for a long time but I personally do not think he elaborate them in a clear way. <br /><br />Also, I do not think he is a person with passion in teaching and helping you. He provided his own-created practice questions for you as homework. However, he will only post the answer to canvas a week or so before the exam. Moreover, his answers which are created by him again are so simple that it could be fewer than ten words for a question with more than 30 marks. It made me so confusing and could not catch up with what he really wanted us to answer. When my friends and I tried to ask him for more detailed answer key, he just answered that he saw no point in doing it and eventually ignored our request.<br /><br />Sorry for those who love Professor Lim a not, but&nbsp;&nbsp;I really do not have much good impression about him.

From UST FYS Secret, I hear that some students get B-range for &gt;90% (not completely assured).<br /><br />During the class, she would invite students to come out and perform activities that facilitate her teaching.

There are two grading systems: 1. 20% each for the two mid term exams and 40% for the final exam; 2. 30% for one of the mid term exams and 50% for the final exam. The teacher assistant will help you to use one of the methods to calculate your final scores. So you no need to worry whether you should attend one of the mid terms or atend both mid term exams.",

Part of the content was already covered in HKDSE syllabus, such as opportunity cost, demand/supply, elasticity, government intervention and production possibilities - these were mostly covered before the first mid-term. After the first mid-term the difficulty of the content has increased a lot - indifference curves, long-run/short-run production, oligopoly games, etc. We might have some basic ideas on these topics in HKDSE but they would be discussed in a more in-depth manner in this course.",

But her speaking tone is pretty boring and flat, making me fall asleep very often... anyway attendance is not compulsory, just skip the lectures if you can understand the content and dislike her voice.<br />TA is Peter. He usually covers useful mathematical approaches for solving problems in tutorials, which the problems will appear in the exams. I think it is good for you to attend the tutorials, or at least take a hard-copy of the tutorial notes.<br />Both Prof. Ding and Peter welcome questions. They are quite patient to answer you.

Before midterms and final exam, she will give us some in-class exercise and MC questions which are generally easy and help us prepare for exam. Sometimes at the beginning of lectures she will share some videos which are quite funny. The TA guy will give us some exercises in tutorials but he is rushing everything super fast !!!

If you are confident in HKDSE economics, you don't need to worry. <br /><br />Topics covered:<br /><br />What is economics?<br />The economic problem<br />Demand and supply<br />Elasticity<br />Efficiency ad Equity<br />Government Actions in Markets <br />Global Markets in Actions<br />Consumers' behavior<br />Output and costs <br />Perfect competition <br />Monopoly<br />Oligopoly<br /><br />Most of the contents require you to understand them instead of reciting them. This may sound good to some people. Moreover, usually at the end of each chapter, there will be a huge part of things that are not included in the exam. So the contents to be tested are less than the actual syllabus.<br /><br />This is a good course for those who like learning because it solidifies your knowledge of HKDSE economics and allows you to learn something new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Warning: There are many graphs in this course so be prepared for that xd",

            "comment_content": "Overall, the content in the beginning seems quite similar to IB Economics HL. However, as you move on passing midterms, the key content (that will be tested in the finals) will be significantly different from the IB syllabus such as indifference curve, groves-clarke mechanism, etc.<br /><br />It may be fine to skip class in the beginning of the semester is you are confident with your knowledge from IB but you may be risking some key contents that IB never touched on and that will be hard to self-study.",
            "comment_teaching": "This is Professor Neary's first year teaching this course, so in view of that, it was quite good. While he may stutter a bit during lectures, he delivers the content quite well and is always willing to listen to students feedback and answer their questions.<br /><br />He also uses interactive games in class to highlight certain material especially during the game theory sections of the syllabus.",
            "comment_grading": "Professor Neary is considerably lenient in his grading and assessments. The homework (10% of final grade) is often the hardest and if you understand the homework, you will more than likely score well in the finals and mid-terms.<br /><br />In terms of level of difficulty, it goes by this:<br />Lecture content&lt;Mid-terms/Finals&lt;Homework<br /><br />Understanding the homework will definitely help in the exams and the Professor and TA often goes through the homework to ensure students' understanding.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is a bit heavier not in terms of quantity but level of difficulty. The homework often includes content that has not been touched in class yet so it will take time to further research about it. Nonetheless, understanding the homework will really help in your general understanding of economics and the course.",
