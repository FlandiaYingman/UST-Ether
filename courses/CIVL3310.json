            "comment_teaching": "✅ He was willing to answer student's questions in details after the lectures. TA always attended lectures, so they were quite helpful addressing your enquiries regarding the course content. <br /><br />✅ Lambros may adopt the short-cut method in solving problems which were quite different from the traditional textbook method. For example, he used kinematic consideration (stability analysis) to perform influence line calculations. <br /><br />✅ Due to the social situation, Lambros uploaded lecture videos for the very last parts of the course, which was a great arrangement and beneficial to our revision. FYI, Lambros never recorded lecture videos in any circumstances in the past years. <br /><br />❌ His lecture materials were quite spontaneous as he may ask the class to pick the numbers for his example randomly. Make sure you sit at the first few rows because he did not provide lecture notes. He wrote all the contents on the whiteboard. Therefore you need to copy them. Sometimes his drawings were quite messy, and students were unable to see the numbers and details. So it would be a disadvantage sitting at the very back. Moreover, it is notable to note that Lambros demonstrate the questions at a quick pace. A mediocre student like me always found the lectures hard to follow.",
            "comment_grading": "Lambros adopted a harsh grade distribution. The midterm in November was suspended due to sudden events during congregation ceremony.

Professor said the marks of all the students are much higher than usual so A- cut off was 92%. 😱😱😱😱",

For CIVL3310, the primary workload is to attend all the lectures and copy all the notes from the whiteboard. Otherwise, you cannot revise for the exam. It is compulsory to attend all the lectures because there were quizzes to be completed, which counted towards your final grade. You will never know when Lambros will assign the quizzes. For off-class workload, you may need to spend substantial time to understand the concepts and examples completely. To achieve better performance, you may need to do the tutorial examples, lecture examples, past papers by hand.",

If you forget these concepts, please brush them up so you can learn more comfortably and suffer less.]<br /><br />Topics [relationship and duration]:<br />Stability [extended from Statics, more comprehensive; L1-L7]<br />Influence lines [COR in Stability is extensively used; L8-L11]<br />Review on 2110&amp;2120 [L12-L13]<br />Conjugate beam [L14]<br />Energy method [L15-L16]<br />Virtual work [extended from Energy method, more convenient; L17-L18]<br /><br />⚠️ Starting from here, you need to deal with statically INDETERMINATE problems, which are more troublesome!<br />Force method [basically application of Virtual work; L18-L20]<br />Displacement method [aka Slope-deflection method; L20-L22]<br />Moment distribution method [variation of Displacement method; L23]<br /><br />💢 As topics are correlated to each other, and some topics aren't intuitive, it's easy to get lost once you misunderstand some concepts. Seek help IMMEDIATELY if you've doubts.<br />💢 In addition, shape multiplication and &quot;hanging of BMD&quot; are used extensively, DON'T underestimate these skills‼️<br /><br />ℹ My thought on this course: Students doing well in 2110 can grasp the course content easier and faster than others as this course is more like a continuation of 2110, rather than 2120.",
            "comment_teaching": "Lambros' teaching style is similar to his performance in Statics, but there are sth worth noticing:<br />1. The teaching pace in 3310 is much faster than in 2110, 🤯 STAY ALERT‼️<br />2. There are many errors in his calculation, but he’ll correct them after starting another things, 🤔, making students quite hard to focus.<br />3. His handwriting in the uploaded lecture notes is very small as in normal lecture in campus, there are also errors in calculation which he doesn't discover in lectures.😣<br />4. Weaker students may have a hard time catching up and understanding what Lambros says.😣<br /><br />In my opinion, Lambros' teaching quality is impaired in online mode. He rushed through the later topics probably due to time constraint. However, you can always ask Lambros about some difficult assignments and request delay on due date. You can interrupt him in lectures too. He also held 2 tutorials during study break to do additional examples and answered students' questions.",

Beam Deflections (Direct Integration) (CIVL2120 Deflection既第一part黎, 要識搵boundary conditions)<br />------Midterm Exam up to here------<br />7. Beam Deflections (Conjugate Beam Method)<br />8. Deflections (Energy Method + Virtual Work) (呢到開始就會教埋frame點搵deflection, 必須對畫[M]非常熟習, 亦係之後用force method計indeterminate structure既基礎)<br /><br />Part II: Statically INDETERMINATE Structure<br />9.
