        "name": "Jerusalem through the Ages: Historical Geography of the Holy City",
        "description": "The reality of a city is determined by its past; this is even more so on the case of Jerusalem, a city sacred to the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam and a focal point in the emerging history of the Middle East. The course will describe the development of Jerusalem from Biblical times to the early 20th century. It will analyze the geographical and historical factors in each period. It will focus on the political and religious conditions of the city through the ages to explain the cycles of rise, growth and prosperity versus periods of decline and stagnation in the history of Jerusalem.",
