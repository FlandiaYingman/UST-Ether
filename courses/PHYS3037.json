You must obtain a copy of this textbook since the weekly homework is to complete some selected questions from the textbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This course covers Ch. 2 to 4, and a little bit of Ch. 5.<br />Ch. 2 Time-independent Schrödinger Equation<br />Ch. 3 Formalism<br />Ch. 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions<br />Ch. 5 Identical Particles<br />This course is basically a more in-depth discussion of the quantum mechanics that PHYS2022 has introduced. Thus it may be advantageous to take this course right after you have taken PHYS2022 when you have a fresher memory. However, since this course require some mathematics concepts (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, basis, multivariable calculus, differential equation etc), better complete MATH2023 and MATH2121 before taking this course. <br />PHYS3037 has extra lectures which teach deeper and more complicated concepts complementary to the topics taught in PHYS3036. If you are interested to take QM II or pursue further studies in physics, 3037 may be quite suitable for you.",
            "comment_teaching": "PHYS3036 and PHYS3037 students share the same 3036 lecture taught by Prof. Chan. The 3037 extra lecture is conducted by Dr. Chen, when 3036 students have tutorials. I did not attend any lecture live since the lecture time doesn't fit well with my personal schedule.<br />Prof. Chan seems to be really passionate. He explains concepts really detailedly, by both mathematical means and conceptual approach. You can learn a lot from his lectures, especially if you are interested in exploring more about quantum mechanics. Only downsides of his teaching are his slightly flat intonation and his sometimes-hard-to-read handwriting. Great instructor overall.<br />Dr. Chen has a really strong mainland Chinese accent in his English, which I personally find really difficult to understand, and it distracts me from listening to the content he's explaining since I need some time to comprehend his words. Sorry Dr. Chen.",

Both classes had the same midterm and final exam papers.<br />Midterm: mean = 49.5, SD = 28<br />Final: mean = 57.9, SD = 27<br />I got a close-to-mean score for midterm exam, above 0.5 SD for finals, around 90% for 3036 homework and around 100% for 3037 homework. My final grade is B, but pretty sure I'm next to the B/B+ boundary. Assuming the mean is B, the grading scheme is similar to other PHYS course and is quite good in my opinion.",

I spent around 4 hours in total every week on homework + catching up on course materials by reading the textbook or watching the lecture videos. Although the quantity of homework is quite a lot in comparison to other UST courses, I think the 3036 homework is essential to learn the computation and application of equations and concepts. I prefer doing extra assignments than revising for quizzes every week, so I won't complain about the 3037 homework.",

For the details, see the first 5 chapters of Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics.<br /><br />For the honors class' extra lecture which replaces the normal class' tutorial, we had a guest lecturer talking about more abstract stuff. For me it is actually easier since I am a pure maths student :P The stuff revolve around poisson brackets, change of variables, and some linear algebra topics, so if you have taken MATH2131 it is immensely easy.<br /><br />Honors and normal class share the same midterm and final exam, and even the same grading curve.",

Basic classical quantum mechanics involving Schrödinger equation, several special potentials and their solutions to SE, linear algebra involved theoretical part of quantum mechanics, multiple particle system and periodic table. 3037 lecture gives more theoretical knowledge regarding the formalism and the evolution from classical mechanics to qm. If you have learnt some stuffs before this course will be quite casual. Mt and final only tested 3036 contents, so 3037 lectures were placed at a very embarrassing situation….with their more-in-depth contents, only 5% of the total grade was allocated to 3037.",
