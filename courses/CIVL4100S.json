        "description": "Geographic Information Science (GIScience) provides important technologies to empower modern civil engineers and smart city applications. This course offers an introduction to a variety of geospatial technologies for managing and processing geospatial information, including geospatial data mapping, remote sensing, and spatial data analysis, in order to facilitate the development of a smarter city. More recently, the emergence of urban big data and advances in artificial intelligence have opened up new opportunities to sense urban dynamics and evaluate the processes and consequences of urbanization. Accordingly, this course will introduce the characteristics of the emerging urban big data and corresponding analytical methods in data visualization, data mining and artificial intelligence. Through a series of data-centric practical projects, this course will introduce students how urban data science can make a different in not only traditional civil engineering and urban studies, but also in supporting smart and sustainable cities through data-driven decision making.",
