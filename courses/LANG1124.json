For those who took GCSE Chinese, you would find the content of the lesson to be quite similar, as it includes topics, such as dream job, summer/ winter holiday, etc. <br />This course is in simplified Chinese, and each chapter has a list of new vocabulary to learn (more than 50 words in each list).<br />The course would also test you on your grammar, such as rearranging a scrambled sentence, and also works on your listening through recordings from the textbook. You would also have to read through the passages in the textbook, though they have a paragraph showing the pin yin, which is quite convenient.",

            "comment_grading": "For quizzes, there will be around 3 during the semester, and they contain content from 3-4 chapters. The professor also gives us the guidelines on the oral quiz, so you can prepare beforehand. You can also make a PowerPoint during the oral presentation. <br />The listening quiz format is a bit strange, since the MCs only show A, B, C and D, and does not show any text. You have to listen very carefully to the recording to know what does A, B, C and D have as their answers.<br />5% will also be counted for class attendance and participation.<br />I would say the grading is quite competitive. Most of the students in this class are experienced in Mandarin and have high marks in their assignments, but even so, some of us got B-B+ range.",
            "comment_workload": "Not very heavy. There is usually only one assignment per chapter, and it is mainly essays. The professor usually discusses how to answer/ tackle the essay, so it makes the assignment not too difficult.",

I don't know why I was put in this class when I asked for LANG 1122. On the bright side, it made me learn a lot of new vocabularies. There are also some words they expect you to already know, I guess those are the ones in 1120-1123, so you might have some extra words to learn. Other words that are not explicitly listed in the vocabulary lists will also be helpful.",

Other than that, you'll have writing examinations, split into 2: writing (short essay) and reading comprehension, short answer, listening, create a sentence. Workload is pretty light in my opinion. Those are your Mid-term Exam and Final Exam.",

This class is a dumping ground for unusual Chinese background people. If you have taken only 1120 but self-studied more Chinese, you could take this class directly but your listening/speaking skills might be weak. If you have lived in China for a long time but have no formal qualifications and you can't really read or write Chinese, then you could take this class. If you were not good enough for 1113, then you could be placed in this class but you cannot move any lower. What can you teach students with such different backgrounds? You mainly teach them vocabulary so they can become on the same level afterwards. You should expect to learn hundreds of words (all of Level 4) after you have finished this class. This includes speaking, listening, and reading but not hand-writing. You must know the Pinyin, however.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Xu was perfectly acceptable; neither outstanding nor terrible. She is an earnest teacher who is trying to teach her students the basics of survival Chinese. She's possibly the most qualified/senior Chinese instructor available because her main priority is the most advanced Chinese class for native speakers. This class, by comparison, is for babies so she teaches everything in a very basic way.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading system was not at all transparent. You must complete ~4 hand-written essays for homework, 2 oral presentations in Chinese, and there are 2 comprehensive examinations. The exams take 2 classes because they cover listening, reading, and writing. The speaking portion is what the presentations are for, so make sure you get a native speaker to check your speech and practice it a lot. You can use any combination of Mandarin, Cantonese, and Pinyin in the written exams so long as your meaning can be understood. <br />Because you are graded on an absolute scale, you are not competing with your classmates so it is quite reasonable. Do these things and your grade will be great. You will be punished for any absence (for any reason!) so try to attend class",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was extremely light for me. The main point of this class is to teach you vocabulary: you will be expected to know all of PSK Level 4 at the end of this class and you are expected to have already learned Levels 1-3. Your main task is to memorise all the vocabulary words. You do not, however, need to memorise how to write these new words. Make sure you can recognise, pronounce, and read all of these words and you will be fine. The essays and presentations are designed to be straightforward. This was possibly the lowest workload class I have ever taken in HKUST.",
