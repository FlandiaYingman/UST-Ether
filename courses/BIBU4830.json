Business constraints like sales and marketing, partnerships, critical success factors in operations, market entry barriers, risk management and relationships with stakeholders will be covered in this course, with special focus on strategic development in the biotech business. Guest speakers will contribute their personal experience to offer a professional view of the key issues, pitfalls and opportunities in their daily business activity. A large use of case studies and other process management techniques will simulate potential scenarios in which students may be called to operate soon after they completed their university career. For BIBU students in their fourth year of study only.",

            "comment_content": "In all honesty, the course content can be very helpful depending on what you want to do in the biotech field. However, what's NOT fun is having to memorise certain shipping procedures and lame-ass leadership theories (tf is Belbin's typology?). Furthermore, the majority of the &quot;good&quot; content will NOT be tested on and you'll be stuck wondering how to correctly order a resource-based strategy. Basically, it's a load of bollocks. <br /><br />Course Content: <br />1. FIPCO <br />2. Strategy I<br />3. Strategy II<br />4. Business Development <br />5. Business Plan I<br />6. Business Plan II<br />7. Regulatory Compliance I<br />8. Regulatory Compliance II<br />9. Project Management <br />10. Corporate and Product Risk I<br />11. Corporate and Product Risk II<br />12. Partnerships <br />13. Valuation I<br />14. Valuation II<br />15. Board Room <br />16. Leadership (lol) <br /><br />To sum it up, a lot of content that, delivered the right way, could be interesting. However, you'll either be experiencing information overload or sheer boredom.",

Classes are generally hard to pay attention in as engagement is not really there.

Then, completely throw that out the window and memorize only the most random information. Do that, and you'll be on your way to A-range.",
            "comment_workload": "1000+ slides is a bit overkill, especially when those slides have an enormous amount of detail you have to remember. Don't bother actually trying to understand the content, just memorize the little details that you'll no doubt forget the following day. <br /><br />The project is also quite a mess. 13 people per group is a great way to find yourself in a situation with a lot of free riders. Enjoy leading that project all on your own! <br /><br />Basically, unless you're a BIBU student, avoid this course like you'd avoid someone without a mask.",
