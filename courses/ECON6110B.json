In addition, due attention is paid to how China’s image globally is being influenced by the Belt and Road Initiative. The final part of the course uses case studies of counties/areas along the Belt and Road (Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia, East Africa and Eastern Europe) to analyze how their bilateral relations with China have evolved as a consequence of the infrastructure projects under the flag of the Belt and Road Initiative.",
