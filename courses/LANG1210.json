            "comment_teaching": "呢個course既老師應該只係得一個。<br /><br />如果從教學既態度黎睇，我覺得佢係呢個世界數一數二既好老師。佢既親和力係我見咁多個professor、tutor同teaching assistance之中最犀利既。上佢堂唔似係上堂，反而似係圍堆傾計咁，係爭在冇個爐可以圍埋一齊打邊爐咁話。佢講一句你讀一句，十足返到細細個同老師學英文咁，氣氛好極。<br /><br />但係如果從教學水平黎睇，呢個係另一個極端。教五十音冇講咩叫濁音咩叫半濁音咩叫促音咩叫拗音，呢D全部係我係咁上網搵片睇先知有。基本上跟住佢咁學就等於完全死背。一個句式又唔分析個結構，就好似學英文唔同你講有SVO咁。如果你係為咗學好日文既話，老師就有如親身帶你行彎路。但係如果你係為咗攞一個好grade，咁其實佢既教得點對你冇咩影響，因為佢教既就等於係你會考到既。（但都係果句，好grade既前提係快人一步識五十音）",
            "comment_grading": "呢個sem好特別，course既成個考核模式大改，所以我俾唔到D咩有價值的訊息。<br /><br />呢個sem冇exam同midterm，全部拆分做21個quiz、6份assignment、一份presentation同5份culture note。差唔多每堂落堂就會叫大家做quiz。內容包含聽、說、讀、寫。<br /><br />QUIZ：<br />quiz題種好豐富，問題可以係MC，可以係英譯日（單詞），難D既可以係對話填充。但D問題其實唔太難。正因為咁所以個個都好高分，所以我話五十音背得熟唔熟先至係分高下既地方。譬如話一個單詞有邊D位要用濁音，同埋留一下D連音現象等既各種小問題，呢D老師唔會教，會係你錯咗之後先至話番你知原來日文會有D咁既野。<br /><br />ASSIGNMENT:<br />呢個sem有3份作文同3個speaking。其實speaking同作文既題目差唔多，好多時甚至可以直接讀個作文就得。而作文主要係叫你用幾句話介紹一D人或事，每份作文都係咁玩法，唯獨介紹既野唔同，而且只要你grammar冇錯，寫夠或講夠一定句數，小心D做基本上滿分。<br /><br />PRESENTATION：<br />呢個係叫你做一個最少三分鐘介紹日本文化既presentation，老師expect你盡量用日文。而成個presentation既得分就係取決於你用幾多日文去present。當時老師並冇講到呢點，係我email過去問佢佢先咁講。所以就算你個present做得幾完美，但係都唔及一個全程用日語做演講既人高分。<br /><br />CULTURE NOTE:<br />呢個我覺得冇咩好講，就純粹係每次老師介紹完一個culture之後寫返少少個人睇法。唔駛寫得好認真，老師講到明只要寫滿五行就有滿分。<br /><br />總括而言，呢個course因為教既野唔深，所以大家既水平都係差唔多，如果可以多D同老師溝通，問清楚D細節，就可以勝在比其他人更了解個玩法。事實上就係好多人睇唔透老師到底係點樣評分，好似作文咁唔知要寫夠一定句數先有滿分，於是就有D輸蝕。此外，我覺得係quiz以外既地方係質同量作取捨既時候可以多側重量，而非質，呢個係我覺得同其他course比較大分別既地方。<br /><br />*都係果句，呢個sem好特別，實際情況係點都係要上一兩堂先知。可能玩法會有D咩變，但都不外乎聽說讀寫。",
            "comment_workload": "Workload一直都唔大。我覺得workload最大既時候得兩個地方，一係背五十音既時候，所以我再三話要盡早背。而另一個係準備presentation既時候。<br /><br />我主要講下present既workload包括D咩。<br /><br />首先，你要對日本文化熟悉，咁先至會有得做。所以你多多少少會花D時間去了解日本文化。其次，你要攞高分就要多包含日文，所以workload大唔大好取決於你打算擺幾多日文落份講稿度。我唔清楚講幾多日文會有幾多分，但我可以肯定你成份野全部係日文就一定滿分。而係大家分數咁接近既情況下，每一分都至關重要。所以workload大唔大都係見仁見智，睇你係為咩而讀呢個course。",

It means it is so competitive in this course. <br /><br />Although you need to fill out the beginner declaration form at the start of the course, it does not mean people taking this course are beginners. Some of them are just going to boost their grades. <br /><br />Need a lot of time to practise and attend all the classes as possible if you want to get an A range.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is very heavy. <br /><br />You need to finish cultures notes 1&amp;2, culture Canvas topic discussion, interactive Canvas communication discussion, speaking assignments 1&amp;2 and writing assignment 1 at home.<br /><br />Moreover, you have to revise for the speaking assignment 3&amp;4, quizzes 1&amp;2 and the final exam before the dates.<br /><br />And the most important thing is that you have no time to practise handwriting Hiragana and Katakana words and sentences in class. <br /><br />There are blended learnings for you to practise dictation and writing at home. You must practise the handwriting of Hiragana and Katakana words and sentences at home a lot so that you can get over 160 marks on quizzes and the final exam.<br /><br />Overall, if you can put a lot of effort and confidence into learning Japanese, this is a good grade course for you.",

So at the start they 'teach' you the hiragana and katagana (which in fact you just need to put hard work into it and memorize everything) and then from that the instructor starts to go on with simple words, structures of sentences, and then writing short paragraphs as well as doing presentation in Japanese.",

            "comment_grading": "They claim to be deploying an absolute grading system but I can assure you that it's not. Main reason is that:<br />1) most people who took the class already knew japanese beforehand<br />2) that leads to the instructor thinking that the quiz is too easy and they adjust the difficulty to an unbelievably monster level (which those freaking people stil managed to score a full mark for that) and that, would eventually made you perform worse. Those people who knew Japanese beforehand could complete the quiz in a blink of eye, and you would be like sitting there for 1 hour and you still cant figure out what was going on with the quiz. <br /><br />Carefully consider whether you want to take this if you have no background in Japanese. Unless it's an must (like GBUS foreign language requirement, but still my adivce is, you'd better take other foreign language courses) or you dont care about the grade, then just go ahead. The instructor is amazing tho.",
            "comment_workload": "It really depends on how fast one could pick up a language and somehow you have to be quite hardworking to catch up with what has been taught during the last week. There are 4 quizzes, which are evenly spread over the semester, so you would probably expect a quiz coming to you every 2.5 week (meaning that you need to understand and recite everything beforehand to take the quiz). Apart from quizzes you also got to do a 1 to 2 min. presentation in Japanese on a cultural topic at the end of the course. Of course you also got a final exam to complete.",

            "comment_content": "As other review had talk about the content with many detail, I won't repeat it again. While if long story short, you can learn some basic Japanese and Japanese culture in this course.<br /><br />However, as most of your classmate have such a knowledge, so if you want to learn Japanese by this course, then I will suggest you don't joining this course as it is hard for you to learn Japanese within one semester.<br /><br />Actually, I join this course for having good grade to help me in major selection and I think many people have learn Japanese before join this course by the same reason.",
            "comment_teaching": "Shiomi sensei was a very good teacher, very kind and he will makes you enjoy the lesson. While it is hard for you to follow his lesson as most of the classmates know Japanese, they will answer the question on the slide very fast and correctly, for those who haven't learn Japanese before you may think that the slide go very fast before you understand the content of it.(like how to read such a word) <br /><br />Overall, Shiomi sensei is the best teacher in UST but it is hard to learn some content from him.",
            "comment_grading": "I don't think grading is really good as it depends on you have the basic knowledge of Japanese or not. For me I have some basic knowledge, so I get A. However, if you don't have it then you maybe get B or even below it. While it is hard for you to get C in this course, so it should be good grade I think.",
            "comment_workload": "As I said if you don't have some basic knowledge of Japanese then it is a very hard course for you.As most of your classmate know Japanese, it is hard for you to above the mean of the quiz.Also the content of the quiz will become harder and harder due to your classmate always get full marks, so you need to spend more and more time on it. <br /><br />While if you know Japanese then it is easy, very low workload and even you don't attend the lesson you can get full marks.(while you need to take attendance so you must go to the lecture)",

            "comment_grading": "Just do all the homework and study for all the quizzes.<br />You almost always get a good mark if you finished the homework. <br />While you really need to pay attention in class to score high in the quizzes, cuz many questions about Japan is asked in those quizzes, which are not in the textbooks.<br />I got an A- overall so it is good I guess.",
            "comment_workload": "It may be quite hard for those who have never learnt Japanese before. You need to be familiar with all the Japanese alphabets in a short time in order to understand things more easier in class. That's really the hardest part. The homework are quite easy, most of them only take a 10 to 15 min to complete and get a full mark. Just go to every lesson and study before the quizzes and the speaking tests.",
