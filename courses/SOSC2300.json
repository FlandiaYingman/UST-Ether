        "description": "Hong Kong is next door to and part of the world’s largest mega-city. How the Pearl River Delta (PRD) evolves will have profound implications not only for its citizens, but also for the global economic system of which it is an important center. This course enables students to understand the evolution of the PRD by examining: the forces of agglomeration that drive regional development; the governance and infrastructure that integrate the region; and the distinct economic and urban developments that create a multi-polar region. In the process they will learn about issues such as multi-level governance, industrialization, foreign direct investment, migration and urbanization, planning and community development, environmental sustainability, regional innovation systems and HK’s integration with the PRD.",
