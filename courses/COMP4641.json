        "description": "This course is an introduction to social information network analysis and engineering. Students will learn both mathematical and programming knowledge for analyzing the structures and dynamics of typical social information networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and MSN). They will also learn how social metrics can be used to improve computer system design as people are the networks. It will cover topics such as small world phenomenon; contagion, tipping and influence in networks; models of network formation and evolution; the web graph and PageRank; social graphs and community detection; measuring centrality; greedy routing and navigations in networks; introduction to game theory and strategic\nbehavior; social engineering; and principles of computer system design. Students who do not have the prerequisites but with equivalent background may seek approval from the instructor for enrollment in the course.",

But, the professor like to announce many important information like midterm time and concepts and related information in lectures, which is really not cool. I prefer to see this kind of announcement in Canvas but he never sent any announcement in Canvas. Be careful of this kind of information. In addition, we have to write emails to TA, asking for the test range of the final exam and all kinds of information that should be provided. Unfortunately, we received none in the end, all the related information comes from TAs.",

Be careful about the test range since there are no announcements of exams, and it is easy to miss some particular lectures. <br /><br />Not recommended to year 2 students. Believe me. <br /><br />: (",

But, participation is strongly recommended since this course has no recording except the tutorial which mainly talks about the assignment. Three assignments can be done very quickly, basically repeating what have learned from the lecture and using Python to prove the phenomenon. The programming included in this course is not hard. Mainly use the networkx in Python and a little pytorch.",

It is enough for you to handle all in this course.<br /><br />The contents of this course are almost the same as the course CS224W in Standford and some of the lecture notes are copys of that. <br />http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/",
