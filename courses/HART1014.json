If you're interested in Chinese calligraphy, you can really consider this course.",

You will have to spend 4+ hours each week to practice. And similar to other review, you will have to have to rewrite your assignment if he is not satisfied.<br /><br />In fact, even the lecturer said there is too much content to teach as he will only teach 4 characters for each lesson of his private calligraphy class. However, I must be fair that such a high workload is given as the lecturer really wants us be good at calligraphy and that requires tons of practice.<br /><br />The final quiz consists of 8 characters for the copybook and 16 character from the poem 霽雪(no copybook for reference) + your Chinese name. This could also take a lot of time to practice if you want to get a good grade.",

            "comment_content": "The syllabus has been attached. You can take a look by yourself.<br /><br />It is noteworthy that you are needed to spend more than $100 to purchase the stationery, either from the bookstore or the professor.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is conducted in Cantonese. It doesn't matter if you can't speak Cantonese, thus some mainland students registered in this course as well. And most of the time the professor will talk about the culture and history of Chinese Calligraphy. And 15-20 minutes will be given to students to practice on their own.",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is too subjective. And the key to get a good grade is to show your good attitude towards the professor and the calligraphy. For example, you can actively attend some talk organized by the professor to show your zealousness and leave him a good impression. Also, you can constantly ask him some questions about calligraphy. Therefore, &quot;擦鞋仔“ can probably get good grades haha.<br /><br />20% Attendance. Nearly all students get full marks in this part.<br />20% Assignment. Nearly all students get full marks in this part. Just upload all your stamped assignments by the end of the semester. <br />60% Final exam. Held on the last class. Significant part that can totally affect your grade. For students who have learned the calligraphy before, it will be easier for them t get good grades.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is super HEAVYYYY!!!!!<br />It's just a one-credit course, however, besides the 2-hour lecture time, you still need to spend several hours practicing and finishing the homework. The quality of homework doesn't affect the grade, but all of them should be assessed and stamped by the professor, and you will be required to do it again if he is not satisfied.",

            "comment_content": "Content is interesting, 陳用老師 demonstrates and gives a lot of extra information about the histories and cultural stuff of varies 書體. So if you are a good story listener you will be happy about that. <br />He also did a lot of demonstrations in class where you can learn through observation.<br />As time is limited for so many 書體，you won't get too deep into each but it is ok for an introductory course.<br />In my term the course is conducted in Cantonese but he can understand PTH too so if you are a mainland student who can understand but can't speak Cantonese very well you can still apply it.",
            "comment_teaching": "He is a very experienced artist. He demonstrate most content very clearly. Sometimes he is clumsy but if you don't understand you are always free to ask him. <br />He is very strict though. He might require you to redo your assignments if they are not good enough. But that is fine because this is art and thats the way he pushes us to get better.<br />He is sometimes very proud and boasts his achievements, just ignore him :D",
            "comment_grading": "Overall students get ok-ish grade. nor sure about the grading of other art courses.<br />For this course, grading doesn't depend only on the results but he also asses you by your attitude or if you are hard working<br />So don't try to &quot;hea&quot; him but pay attention to his instructions and comments even though they seems not to be so important.",
            "comment_workload": "This is a very high work load course, but its art so its normal that the credit doesn't reflects how much work.<br />Each lesson you receive assignments and they usually consumes a lot of time as you need plenty of time to prepare ink and wash brushes and stuff like that.<br />Worth though. If you are interested, and pay a lot of hard work you are going to really gain something from this course (and for life) and get satisfactory benefits.",
