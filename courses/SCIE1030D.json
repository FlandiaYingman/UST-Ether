        "description": "The circulatory system is central to all aspects of human health, and because of this, diseases affecting the circulation and cardiovascular system can have deadly consequences. In this course, we will learn about the circulatory system, diseases that afflict it, and the cardiovascular implants and circulatory assist devices that have been developed to treat cardiovascular diseases for more than five decades. This course is designed to be interdisciplinary, and thus students will work in teams, combining expertise in engineering with that of life sciences. Students should be students who has completed at least two years of UG studies in life sciences, physics or engineering.",
