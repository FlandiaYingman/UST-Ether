But who knows ╮(╯▽╰)╭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wait for the final letter grade out!<br /><br />===Updated 8/6/2022===<br />Letter grades are out, I got a B- from Sumie (Or CLE department). It's 1 sub-grade lower than 1002S. Hmm, luckily no C-range. The LANG 100xS series course has ended. However, the nightmare has not yet come to the end.

Role-playing like devil advocate is interesting to put theory into practice. <br /><br />Reading Paper &amp; Writing Paper: 80 minutes<br />Speaking Test: 5 minutes an adapted version of Part 1: only Question 2 (compare and contrast) &amp; Question 3 (giving opinions), and<br />Part 2 (suggesting solutions).<br /><br />Elpa(online this year) is a closed book exam just dun rely on other source. Speaking(modified version so only type 2 &amp;3 compare contrast/ opinion) : 1 min impromptu speech+ 1 mins immediate response +2mins short speaking(1 mins prep time), just like DSE for the 1 min part. Word limit of writing is 300 words and pretty straightforward, no need to revise a lot for elpa if you listen to Rosita's instructions.

Two themes are included, Beauty and Happiness, which I find useless and boring. <br /><br />Classes are like working on the textbook activities and some discussions and chit-chatting. Giving out limited guidelines for the assessed tasks.<br /><br />Don't even spend any of the class time on ELPA preparation, you should register a time-slot working on the ELPA mock to get familiar with the difficulty and paper-setting.<br /><br /><br />千奇唔好Reg 肥師奶吖Engine仔 我吾想係2030 再見到個肥婆",

If you are not Business students, don't expect her pay attention to what you say, since Business students are more talkative and able to arouse topics that Engineering students are not familiar with, like popular culture and Business studies. Sometimes she might invite students to do silly stuff in front of the class, like singing and J-talking. <br /><br />As the class continues, she follows the textbook and read aloud the content of the powerpoint that she prepared, then conduct some time-talking and group discussions, sharing and language tasks. She talks in an impatient way, like &quot;yea, yea, yea....&quot; <br />So what you are likely to respond,Elaine?<br /><br />The only thing I would praise is, she ends the class early once she finished all the content, which I find myself relieved after suffering for an hour. <br /><br />If you are Engineering or Science students, then good luck to you.

When I received my feedback (not the score) of my essay, she said the essay was well-written, but finally turned out the score not as expected. She marked the tasks with very low transparency and bias, especially if you are Engineering student not Business student, don't expect you can receive proper result, she is an irresponsible and unfair instructor. <br /><br />The only way that secure your grade is ELPA, it's all about your ability to perform well for different papers and the oral test. Probably it's relatively fair.<br /><br />ELPA:<br />Four 4<br />Five 5<br />One 6<br /><br />Turn out B- wtf it's totally unacceptable man please be careful if you want good grade though everyone knows LANG courses are just wasting your time ruining your U life.",

Multimodality in communication (kinda confused cuz it's barely discussed, so not many people know how to perform well in this aspect)<br />I think the academic writing part in the beginning of the course is quite good because it really do improve my English, using a wider range of vocabulary. However, the multimodality part is kinda confusing because how can we perform well in that part? Adding pictures in writings are the usual thing, but it seems inadequate, and I expect something more if the course is primarily focusing on multimodality.<br />I also like the part where we are allowed to discuss with groupmates. It gives us the capacity to interact with people and make friends.<br />You also gotta make a video to present in the end which involves multimodality. Just try to gather some video-editing skills and add some visuals into it. But also don't forget and hesitate about the body movements and facial expressions because these are the multimodal effects which don't require any editing skills. I think these are the criteria which lecturers are looking forward to.<br />Overall, multimodality is a headache to everyone.",

She tried to explain everything in a precise manner, so that everyone will at least have the chance to outperform in the course. I think it's also fun to have a chitchat with her in the beginning of the class or whenever having a discussion, which I regret not having that much.",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is okay because most of my friends, either weak or competent in English, get at least a B range in this course. However, the only one factor that everyone is worried about is the criteria of every competencies, such as grammar usage and multimodality, and the distribution of grades. As I have mentioned, multimodality.... the course didn't include much information about this aspect, while being the title of this course, so how is this part being graded?",

Reflections<br />Thank god I got sembreak in Spring to complete these.<br />Though video editing is said to be not graded, so you don't need editing skills, but I think it's still required somehow because how are you going to create multimodal effects without editing, such as objects movement?",

AND THEY ARE INADEQUATE IN THE VIEW OF A YEAR ONE STUDENT. WHY???? BECAUSE THEY DON'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS, ESSAYS, SPEAKING EXAMS, ELPA......<br /><br />To be honest, that matter is beyond Eugene's control. And he is definitely well prepared for the teaching and adds many contents other than the textbook. For the practice of speaking, we have about a month of practice in the lectures, and the questions are sufficient for the preparation of the speaking exam.<br /><br />The meaningless and time-consuming &quot;Vocab List Exercise&quot; is gone and has been replaced by a simple Vocab exercise online and some reading. Each lecturer has a different method for the reading part, for example, my friend's lecturer is asking him to read an article for half-hour and then answer some questions.<br /><br />For Eugene, he set up a half-hour reading session on Friday. However, there is no restriction on the choice of reading materials. So, some students like me are always reading textbooks HAHAHA. We read and prepare from other lectures at the same time.",

            "comment_content": "This course will focus on developing students’ academic literacy skills for university studies, while continuing to enhance their language proficiency. Key features of the teaching materials, student activities, and assessments will be self-directed learning, communication within a team, and multimodal communication. With the focus on academic literacy, this course introduces students to research skills for finding and evaluating sources for academic writing and speaking tasks. It expects students to be critical in their reading and writing, as they organize, substantiate and synthesize ideas when developing coherent and strong arguments. Collaboration and leadership skills will also be emphasized to further develop skills and habits for autonomous lifelong learning. <br /><br />LANG 1003's assessments include the following:<br /><br />70% of the grade for a multimodal project, which is broken down into several steps<br />30% of the grade for self-directed learning<br />In the table below, you can see the general timeline for the assessments. <br /><br />The multimodal project will begin with 3-4 students making a group and selecting one of the research topics. The group will next write a team contract. The 10-week research projects continues with library research, two academic blogs, a draft of the video in the &quot;storyboard&quot; session, consultations, and a final presentation (see details in the Assessments area of Canvas).<br /><br />The Self-Directed Learning includes the online/blended learning work (including the library workshop), the electives, and an end-of-term reflection (see details in the Assessments area of Canvas).",
            "comment_teaching": "Fantastic. Not only will Rebecca read your material carefully and give you clear directions for improvement, but she will also guide you on how to apply these language skills in other courses in the future. In the evaluations of the surrounding classmates and seniors, her teaching method and reputation are the best in this course.",
            "comment_grading": "Nearly impossible to get A+ in this course, but decent grade could be easily achieved by actively participating and keep communicating with instructor after lesson via email or f2f. If you can ameliorate your written task and received nearly full marks (nearly all facets in 5, some in 4.5), I believe that you will received at least A range. Rebecca is pretty nice in grading sections comparing with most of other instructors, and I got A in her course.",
            "comment_workload": "Really depends on how you learn this course and what ur grade expectation is. If you’re pursuing for A range, you really need to put tremendous extra time on improving ur written tasks and group project (e.g., leading your group and planing for extra meeting with instructor). Well, if you ain’t, no need to wasting your time on preparing for that, and the workload will be normal.",

After some introduction to the course and getting to know your classmates, it is about multimodality, research and library skills, reading, and writing skills like citing, summarizing, synthesis, supporting arguments etc. <br />Some of my classmates considered many of the contents to be useless, but I think I learnt some important things like the research skills, writing skills and teamwork skills. (Or maybe I learnt much of these from my wonderful teammates!) In addition, though making the video and writing academic blogs are really time-consuming, I like multimodality as it allows me to add a little creativity to the assignments, and I acquired some skills that I consider quite useful and thus grew a strong sense of accomplishment.",

And since this is a new course this year, many instructors don't know much about the requirements themselves, including Eugene. It's more efficient to read the instructions and guidelines yourself.

I spent several days finding sources, reading sources and writing each of the academic blogs. We treated the storyboard session seriously and made lots of preparations. The two electives also took much time. Preparing for the video is also time-consuming. We spent lots of time synthesizing our contents, writing a scipt and finding media sources. (pictures and videos and music) And I was the one who finally combined these materials into the final video and added subtitles. Editing a video is really a huge task. It took me several days. We then wrote the short script for live presentation and Q&amp;A. However, there are still three reflection tasks (one talking-head video, two writings) waiting for you after all these.

            "comment_content": "The content of LANG1003 is based on two topics:<br /> 1. Beauty 2. Happiness<br />Because of the COVID-19, the course has posted the e-textbook on canvas as well as other supporting materials such as videos and links. <br />What I heard about that is: They are all synchronized with all LANG1003 sections. AND THEY ARE INADEQUATE IN THE VIEW OF A YEAR ONE STUDENT. WHY???? BECAUSE THEY DON'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS, ESSAYS, SPEAKING EXAMS, ELPA......<br /><br />To be honest, that matter is beyond Eugene's control. And he is definitely well prepared for the teaching and adds many contents other than the textbook. For the practice of speaking, we have about a month of practice in the lectures, and the questions are sufficient for the preparation of the speaking exam.<br /><br />The meaningless and time-consuming &quot;Vocab List Exercise&quot; is gone and has been replaced by a simple Vocab exercise online and some reading. Each lecturer has a different method for the reading part, for example, my friend's lecturer is asking him to read an article for half-hour and then answer some questions. <br /><br />For Eugene, he set up a half-hour reading session on Friday. However, there is no restriction on the choice of reading materials. So, some students like me are always reading textbooks HAHAHA. We read and prepare from other lectures at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, Eugene has set up a 10-week reading reflection exercise which is quite different and innovative. Why? He asks us to make a poem called &quot;Haiku&quot;, creates promotional materials for recommending the books we are reading.... very interesting. <br />But why Eugene you stop replying starting in week 7??? We are curious about others' comments including Eugene.",
            "comment_teaching": "He is well prepared for the teaching.<br />He provides some games for us in the lectures which are very helpful in the teaching. <br /><br />The 1-minute speaking warmup task is good as it becomes our main source of practice speaking assessment when the questions are laying the foundation of a better understanding in happiness, thus you can speak more in the speaking assessment. <br />(To my classmates in the same class, please forgive me for proposing &quot;crazy points and opinions&quot; in the speaking practices and the assessment, as I think that knowledge is common sense for me -.- and if I don't do that you guys will running out of topics easily.) <br /><br />Besides, we even held a gathering in LG7 for lunch, although he insisted that we should only be speaking English as we already don't have much chance for the practice of English. Thus, only me and Eugene were talking the whole time. <br />(At this point, some should already know who I am, HAHA, I don't care!) <br /><br />Well, there is always some improvement for Eugene:<br />1. Classroom Management <br />Some students are obviously not paying much attention to the lecture when Eugene was asking a student called XXX to answer some questions, the student said he did not pay any attention to the lecture, and Eugene simply said please pay attention now. That upset some students.<br /><br />2. The problem of early ending lecture<br />The lectures were held on Wednesday and Friday 1630-1750, especially in the Friday lecture, he always ends the lecture early, which has raised some concerns and upset.<br /><br />3. Stop the zoom meeting too fast so we can't ask questions.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is very good for me. Comparing Eugene with my LANG1002 lecturer Lee Long Shaun WONG. Shaun is more concerned about the accuracy of grammar and pronunciation. I know that he is quite hard-working, he gave detailed reasons and comments in the marks posted in the CLE assignment feedback system. But, his comments are quite harsh and iron -.-<br /><br />In LANG1002, Shaun at most gave me 2 to 3 marks in my assessments, thus I got a C grade in LANG1002.<br /><br />(My guessing) Eugene has the experience of teaching HD /ASSO, thus his teaching style is very similar to my experience in HD, thus I am more acceptable to Eugene's teaching. And his grades us in the similar fashion of my lecturers back in HD. In short, that is giving students credits for the encouragement to try English.<br /><br />Writing Task (25%)<br />4/0/5/4/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full mark is 7 <br /><br />Essay Writing Process (10%)<br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full mark is unknown to me<br /><br />Speaking assessment (Not ELPA) 25%<br />5/5/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full mark is 7 <br /><br />Vocab learning reflection(10%)<br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full mark is unknown to me<br /><br />ELPA speaking assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;(Total ELPA made up 30% of the total marks of the grade of LANG1003)<br />5/5/5/4<br /><br />ELPA writing/reading assessment<br />Reading 20<br />writing unknown<br /><br />Estimated grade I will get:<br />B to C+<br /><br />Update: Finally I got B+",

Although sometimes he seemed very helpful, for example, he encouraged us to ask him questions, his advice was not very helpful. Once I consulted my essay outline with him, he simply told me my focus question was not debatable and&nbsp;&nbsp;thesis statement was not good enough without suggesting me how to improve and looking at my arguments. It was a little bit frustrating as he was not helping solve my problems but adding more problems to me.",

So I think this is good for us to have a practice because we almost don't speak in English out of the class. And also she is willing to answer any question regarding the assessment, so this can help us understand more about the criteria of marking.

As the topic is decided by you, instructor will help you explore some parts of beauty to help you make the decision. Also, she will focus of training your writing skill. Just make use of what she teaches you and the academic writing format you have learnt then you can get a decent grade.<br />The second topic is happiness and the task for it is to have a 21 minutes speaking (2 minute individual speech + 1 minutes thinking time + 12 minutes group interaction). The goal of it is to reach a common position on which idea as you and your group suggested are most effective and feasible in improving happiness. So you will learn many speaking skills and things about happiness from the instructor. Just get well prepared, listen to her advice and speak like real conversation and then you can get good marks.<br />The most important thing of the course is not about what she has taught in class but ELPA. ELPA carry large proportion in the course and it really depends on how well you have learnt English since you were young. You will still get a bad grade even if you get excellent score in the tasks and fail ELPA. So…..Good luck.",
            "comment_teaching": "Her teaching is excellent in every aspect. She is a very hard-working teacher. She teaches everything in the book while she also gives you extra notes prepared by her to help you understand the concept or finish the task. Her advice on tasks is very useful so you must listen to her in order to get good result. She will even spend time out of lesson to give personal feedback on your performance. The most important thing is that having her lesson is totally not boring and I enjoy having her lesson. The atmosphere of her lesson is very fun and you can even tell some joke and make fun of her during lesson, which makes the lesson really fun. She is god-class instructor if you want to learn things, get good grades while not wasting your time.",

Eventually I got A-, which in my opinion is a very good grade for my score. So I think her is grading is quite lenient as long as you are active in her class and punctual.",

Before each class, he will play music or short videos for students to calm down and focus. Though he claims that he is strict with attendance, it is acceptable if being late for classes or skipping the class because of other activities once. Ivan even gave away chocolates and candies during holidays. <br />Then, Ivan is quite serious and enthusiastic about his job. He made slides for each class and provide a huge amount of examples for better understanding. He is used to making use of videos, Facebook articles and other interesting formats to arouse students' interest. His group discussions are well prepared and instructed as well. He is eager to help students with their English, so he is willing to answer your questions no matter during classes or through e-mails. He even provides extra exercise and mock test for vocab test.

You will only be informed by him a lesson before the Vocab test.
