        "description": "This course presents a brief integrated view on the roles of defects in mechanical behavior of materials. The basic concepts, equations and methods used in the analysis of defects by continuum mechanics and thermodynamics approaches are introduced in the course. The important roles of defects such as cracks, dislocations, second phase inclusions, grain- and phase-boundaries in behavior of materials are described intensively with illustrative examples.",
