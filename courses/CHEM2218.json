            "comment_content": "The contents covered are molecular symmetry, molecular orbitals, transition metals and crystal structures. It was designed pretty well and a lot of examples were provided in the power point slides. The content of the power point is a bit similar like textbook but there are some things that the professor did not cover on the textbook. The molecular symmetry is the hardest topic for me since you have to know how to rotate stuff in your head and imagine how the chemical would look like after inversion or reflection. If you good in imagining things, this topic would not be a problem. The rest of the topic is pretty okay but you have to really understand the concepts (like every course required). Overall, it's interesting course.",

Moreover, he always reviewed what has been discussed on the previous lecture in a way it kinds of refresh what he taught last time.",
