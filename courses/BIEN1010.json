The aim of this course is to present some of the basic science and human physiology knowledge used by biomedical engineers and illustrates the first steps in applying this knowledge to solve problems in human medicine. The second goal of this course is to link knowledge of basic science and engineering to fields of specialization and current research. This course also introduces the sub-specialties in biomedical engineering and through real-life examples to emphasize the types of problems biomedical engineers solve.",

            "comment_content": "Course review (Refer to other post for syllabus' details):<br />Module 0: Introduction<br />Just introducing some basic chemistry and biology concepts. This part should be made for students who never study chemistry and biology in high school. Terence said that it won't be covered in exams but I don't know whether it is true.<br /><br />Module 1: Bioinstrumentation and Bioimaging<br />This part is more physics since as the title states, it covers concepts in instrumentation and imaging. Especially if you study DSE physics Elective 4 (Medical physics), you will meet some of the concepts again in this module.<br /><br />Module 2: Biomolecular Engineering and Biomaterials<br />This part is more biology since it covers more cellular concepts. This year Terence made an unique topic on COVID-19.<br /><br />You may be worried if you don't have science background. Don't worry, the concepts are very simple and they are easy to follow. If you pay attention to the lecture and the lecture notes, you are&nbsp;&nbsp;basically fine even though you have zero science background. For the exam, referring to lecture notes is very enough (it is open-book, open-notes and open-Internet) so what actually matters is the searching speed and your awareness. <br /><br />There are other remarks:<br />First one is that the class sometimes takes attendance in the form of in-class Canvas quizzes, regardless of your answers. In other words, once you finish the quiz you can get the attendance.<br /><br />Second one is that there is a group project. For this sem the task is investigating a technology in the current biological engineering industry. You need to write a short report and give an oral presentation. Also, you need to do peer evaluation so don't freeride otherwise you have to take the consequences. You will lose report marks if your peer evaluation is unsatisfactory. Also, an absence on oral presentation will result in the absence of your oral presentation marks. I think the freeride-prevention policy is effective enough so the risk of being free-rided should be less than other project-required course.",
            "comment_teaching": "I have no complaint on Terence's teaching. It is perfect.<br /><br />He is a local professor. The pronunciation and pace are both comfortable and easy to follow. Frankly speaking, instead of being professors who always keep a straight face and being serious, he acts and speaks more like your friends, which always be kind and generous. This makes the learning atmosphere very comfortable and narrows the distance between Professors and students. It is very good.<br /><br />Another good thing is that he is willing to receive feedback from students. Sometimes he asks student to fill a feedback survey, asking whether the teaching speed, content difficulties, etc, are ok. I think it is good that the professor is willing to hear feedback and do self-improvements, instead of always making &quot;self-thinking-good&quot; but actually disastrous education with no improvements.<br /><br />Not joking, Terence should be a model of university teaching. <br /><br />Also, remember his name.<br />Terence(O<br />Terrence(X<br />Terance(X<br />Terrance(X",
            "comment_grading": "Grading scheme:<br />1. Assignment 10% (2.5% for each, 4 sets)<br />2. Participation 10% <br />3. Group project 20% (5% report + 10% presentation + 5% peer evaluation) <br />4. Mid-term exam (ONLY module 1) 30% <br />5. Final exam (ONLY module 2) 30%<br /><br />My performance:<br />1. Assignment: Full marks<br />2. Participation: Unknown. However, I did all in-Canvas quiz so probably full marks?<br />3. Group project: Also unknown...<br />4. Mid-term exam: 51/59 (1 question deleted)<br />5. Final exam: 47/50<br /><br />Final grade: A-<br /><br />Although I got A range, I won't say the grade is very good since the situation is similar to other introductory course. As you know UST is a university which is crammed with academic gods. An easy course means that you have to get very very high marks in order to get A range. This course is not an exception although the professor is very kind because he still has to follow the university grading policy (If there are no restrictions, he may probably give everyone an A+ XD). As a result, careless mistakes or free-riders may results in a drop of subgrade. You had better watch out these small problems because you should have no problems on the lecture content while these small problems can take you out.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a blessing in disguise is that I think Terence should have distributed as much A ranges as he can since he is kind to us. In the lecture he told us that he knew UST is very stressful so he would like to be kind to all of us. Therefore, I still appreciate his grading.",
            "comment_workload": "I think the workload is light despite having a project. <br /><br />The assignments are quite simple. Searching the lecture notes is ok and you are able to finish them within 1 hour. Not a big deal.<br /><br />Although project looks troublesome, actually it doesn't. The written report only requires two pages and the presentation powerpoint only requires 8 pages. They are quite short and don't require many information. If your teammates DON'T FREERIDE and hold meeting regularly, your progress will be fine at all.<br /><br />However, although workload is light and the content is easy, don't do nothing before the exam. Terence will literally examine every parts of the lecture notes, even things in small corners. Therefore, before exam, you had better go through every lecture notes (If you have sufficient time, better run through lecture videos as well). Make sure that you can roughly remember where the information is. Of course it is not necessary to recite the whole lecture notes (I think no one will try to do that also...). At least you should be able to locate the information so that you can refer to them faster in the exam, but not start reading during the exam.",

Don't fret if you are absolutely new to this: Terence has a Module 0 for absolute beginners in biology and chemistry. I do recommend a foundation in physics though, not pure words like PHYS1001, but actual usage of physics equations and formulas, since the course covers quite a few of those.<br /><br />No textbooks are required or recommended, though it might help with understanding. Since this is the very first review of the course, here are the details:<br /><br />Module 0: Introduction<br />Lecture 1: Course Overview<br />Lecture 2: What is Biomedical Engineering<br />Lecture 3 - 4: Basics of Biomolecular and Cellular Principles<br /><br />Module 1: Bioinstrumentation and Bioimaging<br />Lecture 5: Overview and Body Temperature<br />Lecture 6: Bioinstrumentation - Blood Pressure<br />Lecture 7: Bioinstrumentation - Pulse Oximetry<br />Lecture 8 - 9: Bioinstrumentation - From Blood Tests to Flow Cytometry<br />Lecture 10: Bioimaging - Overview, X-ray and CT Scan<br />Lecture 11: Bioimaging - MRT, PET and Ultrasound<br />Lecture 12: Bioimaging - Optical and Photoacoustic Imaging<br /><br />Module 2: Biomolecular Engineering and Biomaterials<br />Lecture 13: Biomolecular Engineering - Overview<br />Lecture 14 - 15: Drug Delivery, Tissue Engineering, and Nanobiotechnology<br />Lecture 16 - 17: Biomolecular Engineering II - Engineering of Immunity<br />Lecture 18: Biomedical Engineering and Cancer<br /><br />There are special pre-Mid-term and pre-Final review lectures to help prepare you for the non-cumulative, open-book exams, as well as research sharings in the biomedical or bioengineering field, since BIEN is a new UG Major available for choosing at HKUST as of this review.<br /><br />Lecture videos are provided so that attendance is not compulsory, but the attendance is still highly recommended since the lecture notes do not include every single detail.",
            "comment_teaching": "I adore Terence.<br /><br />Terence is a local professor who studied abroad for a while, so his English is not bad. His lectures aren't the typical professor-shit-talks-and-not-give-a-damn-about-sleeping-students type. Instead, there is a system where he throws a mouse-sized teddy bear and the person who catches it will have to answer his question related to the immediate lecture content. An update was introduced to the system, such that inert students can cover up their faces to avoid questioning. Such interactive style of classes is something that I, having a credit transfer for English Language courses, never quite experienced at the University.<br /><br />Terence is also very malleable in course arrangement. He understands that his preference on what to teach could be different from what students want, so he regularly asks if we like the syllabus and content. He takes students' advice into account, and improves the course accordingly, which is, frankly, uncommon among professors and lecturers.<br /><br />Terence is also able to explain concepts clearly, and when he asks students to answer his questions, he would rephrase and repeat the answer for all students' sake. He is also able to remember most if not all of his students' names, which goes to show his passion in teaching and making friends with us.<br /><br />Terence absolutely deserves an A+ for his teaching.",

The course is named &quot;Introduction to biomedical engineering&quot; and many people expected it to be biology-related. In fact, the content is quite heavily physics-related. About 50% of the course is just telling you the names and functions of BioMed engineering tools, the other 50% is to actually understand the principle behind it, which is mostly physical related.

Though I would say the grading is quite good since I am getting the &quot;average people&quot; results and still managed to get A-range. <br />I am satisfied with my results though considering I didn't put a lot of expectations when marks come out, but the outcome is A-range anyways so yeah!",

You are required to have a group meeting (f2f or Zoom is both acceptable) once per 2 weeks (at least 4 times, UG TA needs to be there too). Your topic will prob be decided in the first meeting and basically just do some research online and it will be fine for the project. You will do a presentation (not the type in front of the class, half of the groups do the presentation and the other half of the groups + PG TA UG TA will be doing the marks) and a report, both deadline is near the end of the semester.<br />One thing to note, I highly recommend getting some groupmates that can lead the team forward. Myself doesn't have friends taking the same course so I gets random groupmates (two year 4 students and they lead the group so well!!) and me the year 1 small potato get carried throughout the semester really appreciated!!",

This part should be made for students who never study chemistry and biology in high school. Terence said that it won't be covered in exams but I don't know whether it is true.<br /><br />Module 1: Bioinstrumentation and Bioimaging<br />This part is more physics since as the title states, it covers concepts in instrumentation and imaging. Especially if you study DSE physics Elective 4 (Medical physics), you will meet some of the concepts again in this module.<br /><br />Module 2: Biomolecular Engineering and Biomaterials<br />This part is more biology since it covers more cellular concepts. This year Terence made an unique topic on COVID-19.<br /><br />You may be worried if you don't have science background. Don't worry, the concepts are very simple and they are easy to follow. If you pay attention to the lecture and the lecture notes, you are&nbsp;&nbsp;basically fine even though you have zero science background. For the exam, referring to lecture notes is very enough (it is open-book, open-notes and open-Internet) so what actually matters is the searching speed and your awareness.<br /><br />There are other remarks:<br />First one is that the class sometimes takes attendance in the form of in-class Canvas quizzes, regardless of your answers. In other words, once you finish the quiz you can get the attendance.<br /><br />Second one is that there is a group project. For this sem the task is investigating a technology in the current biological engineering industry. You need to write a short report and give an oral presentation. Also, you need to do peer evaluation so don't freeride otherwise you have to take the consequences. You will lose report marks if your peer evaluation is unsatisfactory. Also, an absence on oral presentation will result in the absence of your oral presentation marks. I think the freeride-prevention policy is effective enough so the risk of being free-rided should be less than other project-required course.",
            "comment_teaching": "I have no complaint on Terence's teaching. It is perfect.<br /><br />He is a local professor. The pronunciation and pace are both comfortable and easy to follow. Frankly speaking, instead of being professors who always keep a straight face and being serious, he acts and speaks more like your friends, which always be kind and generous. This makes the learning atmosphere very comfortable and narrows the distance between Professors and students. It is very good.<br /><br />Another good thing is that he is willing to receive feedback from students. Sometimes he asks student to fill a feedback survey, asking whether the teaching speed, content difficulties, etc, are ok. I think it is good that the professor is willing to hear feedback and do self-improvements, instead of always making &quot;self-thinking-good&quot; but actually disastrous education with no improvements.<br /><br />Not joking, Terence should be a model of university teaching.<br /><br />Also, remember his name.<br />Terence(O<br />Terrence(X<br />Terance(X<br />Terrance(X<br /><br />GRADING",
            "comment_grading": "Grading scheme:<br />1. Assignment 10% (2.5% for each, 4 sets)<br />2. Participation 10%<br />3. Group project 20% (5% report + 10% presentation + 5% peer evaluation)<br />4. Mid-term exam (ONLY module 1) 30%<br />5. Final exam (ONLY module 2) 30%<br /><br />My performance:<br />1. Assignment: Full marks<br />2. Participation: Unknown. However, I did all in-Canvas quiz so probably full marks?<br />3. Group project: Also unknown...<br />4. Mid-term exam: 51/59 (1 question deleted)<br />5. Final exam: 47/50<br /><br />Final grade: A-<br /><br />Although I got A range, I won't say the grade is very good since the situation is similar to other introductory course. As you know UST is a university which is crammed with academic gods. An easy course means that you have to get very very high marks in order to get A range. This course is not an exception although the professor is very kind because he still has to follow the university grading policy (If there are no restrictions, he may probably give everyone an A+ XD). As a result, careless mistakes or free-riders may results in a drop of subgrade. You had better watch out these small problems because you should have no problems on the lecture content while these small problems can take you out.",
