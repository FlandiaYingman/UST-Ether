            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Xu is extremely passionate about teaching and very knowledgeable in this field. He also often mentions plenty of research and related anecdotes which makes the lectures more engaging. Prof. Xu doesn't upload lecture notes so you have to attend class and note them down yourself. <br /><br />Besides the lecture, I would strongly encourage the students to attend the tutorials too. The TA (Yuefeng Wei) is Prof. Xu's PhD student and his tutorials are very helpful for completing HW and preparing for the exams.",
            "comment_grading": "Two grading schemes:<br />A) HW 15%, Midterm 35%, Final 50%<br />B) HW 15%, Final 85%<br /><br />Midterm is closed-book while Final is Open-book.<br /><br />My midterm score: 95/100&nbsp;&nbsp;(mean: 76.43, median 85)<br />My final score: 162/200 (mean: 90, median:122.5)<br /><br />Letter grade: A+<br /><br />FYI, I got the highest scores on both exams. The class size is generally small(&lt;10) so grading is curved i.e. highest scorer mostly gets an A+ (assuming they performed well enough) and everyone else is graded accordingly. Even if someone performs HORRIBLY, they will usually still at least manage a B-. So grading is good from UG standards.",
            "comment_workload": "Lecture materials are on par with any other typical 4000/5000 level MATH course. Prof. Xu will announce a couple of HW questions during the lecture every week or so. Some might take quite a lot of effort but TA is super helpful for HW assignments. For students not accustomed to tensor notations or PDE analysis, there might a steep learning curve at the start. I think you can still manage a decent grade without EXTREME effort but in order to get an A+, you'll definitely have to practice quite often. (I covered all the lecture materials at least twice outside of class for revision + some practice questions from online resources).<br /><br />The midterm exam was relatively easy (assuming you are able to do all the tensor calculations, and equation derivations without referring to notes). For the final exam, since it was open book, the first ~50% of the exam was quite easy (as you can follow the lecture note examples closely) but the latter half consisted of a couple of questions on Riemann Invariants and 2-D Flow which were quite challenging.",
