            "comment_teaching": "Professor Yan's and professor Meng's classes are pretty clear and well-organised.<br />Professor Zhu's classes are mostly just PowerPoint reading, not a very good idea for this topic.<br />Professor Chen's classes are just confusing and feel unorganised.<br /><br />In addition, the arrangement for the final report submission and the homework for professor Chen's part is chaotic, the homework question was not posted until 2 days before the deadline, the instruction for the submission of the final report was unclear, and I suspect even the other 3 professors were confused about the arrangement",
            "comment_grading": "Attendance: 10%<br />Homework: 15%<br />Final Report: 45%<br />Presentation: 30%<br />Remarks: Not sure if this is accurate<br /><br />Since there isn't any data released for the final report and presentation score, I can only speak from personal experience, and it does seem pretty lenient.",
            "comment_workload": "1 homework issued by each of the 4 professors, they are not difficult, just go through the note, some basic understanding is needed but not demanding.<br /><br />As for the final report, it depends on what your group choose to work on.<br /><br />No need to worry about the presentation, just need to make sure you know what's in your report and you will be fine, the use of PowerPoint is optional, you can just screen share your final report and talk with it on screen",
