Most of the PowerPoints are short (about 20-40 pages each) and consist of key concepts only which are easy to understand. Some of the contents are quite interesting, such as the experiments, for example, the Bobo Doll experiment, that were carried out to investigate certain theories related to psychology.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor teaches in a fun way, she is very nice and always smiles when she talks and tries to make the atmosphere very relaxing. You won't fall asleep easily in this class. Also, there are musical warmups in the first 5 minutes of class, a small break halfway through the lecture, and often video clips about some experiments or studies will be shown. Sometimes she will ask students questions about their opinions/thoughts on a topic, and she will give interesting responses.",

If you understand the concepts well enough, you can easily score high in both exams. No need to memorize large amounts of points/notes/materials.<br /><br />Paper assignments are the most difficult part of this course. You need to write an essay of no more than 500 words about a specific topic/issue. Essays need to follow the APA citation format, which is discussed during the writing workshop. Proper citation is required as plagiarism will be checked during marking.<br /><br />Research participation requires you to take 3 surveys. You need to apply through the SONA system yourself. If you complete all 3 surveys, you can get all 10% of this part, which is easy to achieve.<br /><br />Finally, there are 2 opportunities for bonus points, one is the writing workshop, and the other is a guest lecture by a counselor.<br />My results are: above 1 SD in both exams, above 0.5 SD in essay 1, mean in essay 2, final grade is A. Grading is very good in my opinion.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is light, only 2 paper assignments and 2 exams in the whole term. For exams, you only need to study the PPTs, there is no need to study the textbook (although it is recommended). Research participation is easy and only take a max of 1.5 hours in total (just register ASAP for the surveys). Full attendance of lectures is not required, although attending will certainly help you familiarize with the concepts.",

All topics covered are very important to a HKUST student. Topics on Learning, Memory and Sleep make me reflect on the ways that I used to learn. <br />Topics on Development, Personality, and Disorders make me better understand myself and truly reflect on our own. We struggles a lot in HKUST, fighting for GPA, internships, competitions, achievements..., we are so busy that we overlook our mental health/stress level. Through a lot of theories, discussions or cases introduced in the course, I truly reflect on my university life, where does my hatred of HKUST comes from, how my childhood experience unconsciously affect myself..., and now I feel like I am doing much better after this course.<br /><br />OK, enough chicken soup for the soul. I think your experience on this course largely depends on your past personal experience. Nevertheless, the psychological experiments are fun to study. Like bystander effect, how a stranger standing next to a man affects his urination process, Pavlov conditioning experiment, etc.",
            "comment_teaching": "Instructor: Siu, Nicolson<br />Since the SOSC department is lack of psychology lecturers, to meet with the great demand for Sosc1960/1980, they decided to switch these courses to be real-time online mode. RTO mode will NOT provide any video recordings.<br /><br />It is the first time Nicolson is teaching this course. He taught biological psychology and he focus more on neuroscience part. Therefore, sometimes he will provide more extra insight for those parts, but not examined.<br /><br />The lecture notes are redesigned by Nicolson and Annie, and I appreciate they add many interactions between students and instructors. This is also one reason why they decide to switch to RTO mode. They can gain more feedback from students.<br /><br />In summer semester, every lesson is ~3 hours. It is very tough for both lecturers and students to focus. You can also see Nicolson's excitement/performance drops through out the class. He ended up reading the powerpoint slide in the end. However, in next lesson, he will revisit the parts he simply read out before and provide more examples and explanations.<br /><br />His English is very typical HK accent, and he always provide real-life examples to illustrate different concepts. Sometimes he will give &quot;moral of the story&quot;: which means how a theory can help us in real-life. I think these are the most important takeaways from this course.<br /><br />He often asks for student engagement in class and asked if there is any questions. He also held consultation sessions (You can ask in Cantonese). Generally a very helpful instructor.",

            "comment_workload": "Each quiz consists of 60 MCQs with 60 minutes of time. You can go backward and all quizzes are open-notes, open-book (the online one). They design the quiz to be speed test rather than difficulty test to prevent cheating. I think if you have attended all the lectures and revised for 1-2 nights, 60 minutes are more than enough.<br /><br />The syllabus of the quiz claims to include the online textbook, and majority of the questions can be solved solely relying on lecture materials. I think for every quiz 1-2 questions are testing textbook-exclusive material. Like they ask for the catatonic reaction of Schizophrenia in quiz 2 which is not in the lecture notes.<br /><br />In each assignment, you have to write at most 500 words to answer several questions. Citations are not mandatory. I did not cite anything in my Assignment 1.<br /><br />Research Experience is easy, just watch a video/do a personality test, and write 200-300 words, then you get the 10%.<br /><br />The content in this course is generally not difficult. Therefore you can see high median in quizzes/assignments.<br /><br />---update after assignment 2 grade release---<br />In my assignment 2, I quote 3 journal articles to support my ideas. I think although providing citation is not mandatory, it gives you higher marks. (Of course you have to quote proper evidence)",

            "comment_content": "一個入門級既psychology course<br />內容一共分為4個theme，20個topic<br />因為係入門級既緣故，所以內容唔會太深入，適合啲冇讀過但又有興趣接觸psycho既beginner<br /><br />Introduction: Why and how scientists study human mind and behavior<br />#1 Overview: Through understanding human mind and behavior, we can make a better world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />#2 Scientific method: Scientists use a variety of tools to study human mind and behavior. <br />好搶手既CC，因為咁我係喺第一個禮拜之後先wait到依個course，所以我冇上過依兩堂，不過依兩個topic唔洗考所以都冇咩好留意<br /><br />Theme 1: How we experience the world <br />#3 Perception: What we see is not always what exists.<br />#4 Circadian rhythm: A lot of things happen in our body and mind while we sleep.<br />#5 Consciousness: Our experience of the world is governed by both the conscious and the unconscious.<br />#6 Emotions: There are universality as well as cultural differences in our emotional experiences. <br />#7 Learning: It is possible to make wolves retreat from sheep and to train pigeons to play ping pong. <br />幾有趣既topic，主要係講我地點樣去認識世界<br /><br />Theme 2: How we solve problems<br />#8 Memory: Forgetting and false memory can be traced back to how memory is formed. <br />#9 Rationality: It is not always easy to make a rational decision, as we are bounded by capacity and motivation.<br />#10 Intelligence: IQ scores are useful, but they fail to cover the many abilities that are important to success.<br />講知識方面既野<br /><br />Theme 3: Why we behave in the way we behave <br />#11 Motivation: A number of needs, some basic and some higher-order, direct and energize our behavior.<br />#12 Personality: Personality, when properly assessed, can predict a lot of things about a person. <br />#13 Development: We are who we are because of what we were born with and what we experienced growing up.<br />#14 Parental influence: Our parents shape who we are in both visible and invisible ways. <br />#15 Social influence: Our behavior is often influenced by actions by other people.<br />講一個人的行為係社會同家庭既影響下形成<br /><br />Theme 4: The dark and bright sides of our functioning<br />#16 Abnormality: The boundary between what is normal and what is abnormal is fuzzy. <br />#17 Psychological disorders: A better understanding of mental illness may reduce the stigma around it.<br />#18 Psychotherapy: Therapists use a number of psychological techniques to treat psychological disorders.<br />#19 Mind and body: A healthy mind boosts a healthy body.<br />#20 Positive psychology: Happiness brings success, health and even longevity, but it has dark sides. <br />講一啲心理上既問題同疾病，仲有心理治療既方法<br /><br />Btw，除左lecture之外仲有recommended readings，入面既內容唔會考，所以可以當係read for fun",
            "comment_teaching": "幾有passion既一個professor，好容易follow到佢講既野，基本上只有上過一次堂就可以明白到大部份既野<br /><br />除此之外堂上間中會播下片（例如一啲experiment)，可以當係加深對內容既理解，所以雖然唔take attendance但都幾推薦去上堂<br /><br />值得一題既係佢既ppt slide有時會比我地有既多幾張hidden slide，所以有上堂既可以學多啲野咁（不過多果啲內容似乎冇喺quiz到考，至少我上果個sem係）",
            "comment_grading": "Research experience (5% x 2)<br />Essay (20%)<br />Reflective writings (5% x 2)<br />Quizzes (30% x 2)<br /><br />Research experience有兩份，分別係research exercise同research study。前者要你design一個experiment，後者需要參加一份survey然後寫返reflection，兩份都係P/F scale，合格就有齊5分，所以基本上人人滿分<br /><br />Essay上限800字，值得注意既係essay除左要引用一啲research findings之外，可以講多啲點解會有咁既findings<br /><br />Reflective writings，200字既reflection，主要寫你喺依個course學左啲咩，4個theme入面總共會有4份writings，當中揀兩份寫，grading都係P/F計，所以建議做左頭兩份writings先，咁樣如果fail左任意一份都仲有兩份比你做（不過一般冇人會fail，都係基本上人人滿分）<br /><br />Quiz有兩份，non-cumulative，Quiz 1 (Topic 3 to 10), Quiz 2 (Topic 11 to 20)，MC + open book，問既內容幾易同straightforward，因為內容唔難所以mean好高，不過基本上只要ensure你每堂lecture都follow到既話唔難高分/滿分，最緊要小心唔好有careless<br /><br />Score for reference<br />Essay: Mean (15.70/20, SD 4.01)<br />Quiz 1: Mean (25.33/30, SD 3.37)<br />Quiz 2: Mean (25.92/30, SD 4.22)",
            "comment_workload": "雖然好似好多assignment（2份reflective writings + 2份research experience + Essay），但其實每份既word limit好低，除左essay要800字上限之外，其他都係200字上限<br /><br />Essay方面可能要花多少少時間（因為要引用source），而且時間接近midterm period，最好早少少準備<br /><br />Quiz因為係openbook既關係，只要平日有上堂既其實一日已經夠溫（當然aim high既話最好用多少少時間），問題形式係MC，問題通常會比個case你然後問你依個係咩野concept<br />Example: Someone afraid of snow after he experiences avalanche, what kind of learning process does this illustrate?<br />A) Classical Conditioning B) Operant Conditioning C) Obersavation Learning... etc<br />所以溫書既時候最好每一個concept都識得舉一反三，確保自己明白example同concept既關係",

            "comment_workload": "Preparing for the quizzes is not difficult. Going through all the lecture slides and extra slides (provided during lectures) is enough. Note that a few questions in the quizzes are based on the extra slides (Don't skip lectures if you want to score high!). Most of the questions are conceptual, i.e. testing whether you can understand the concepts / distinguish between different concepts. Not much memorization of details is required. If you understand all the concepts clearly, you will be fine.<br /><br />Tips: Each MCQ consists of 4 options. You may anticipate that questions with a set of 4 similar concepts as the 4 options will more likely to appear in the quizzes. Here is an example (created by me):<br /><br />(#07 Learning) Taking away a child's favorite toy as the result of his misbehavior at school is an example of ...<br />A. positive reinforcement<br />B. negative reinforcement<br />C. positive punishment<br />*D. negative punishment<br /><br />I think the workload mainly comes from the essay. The topic of the essay was announced a few days after the add/drop period, and the deadline for the essay was set during the midterm period (Week 8). You have more than 1 month to complete the essay. The essay will probably clash with your midterm(s) if you are a deadline fighter.",

            "comment_teaching": "In terms of the lectures, I would say that it's just an average one. Lai will read the lecture notes and sometimes demonstrate with videos. <br />But I would say that you will have a bad learning experience. Details are mostly in &quot;grading&quot; part.",
            "comment_grading": "It's a CCC so never expecting any good grades.<br />The professor and TAs are procrastinating. For example, we submitted the first assignment on 2/7 and the second on 16/7, each of which accounts for 15%. Now it's 31/7 and we haven't got any grades. It's said that the teaching team wants to discourage you from arguing. The same is true of quizzes, each of which accounts for 30%. It's 40 MCs but it takes them more than a week to grade with bubble sheets applied. They would also make it complex to discourage you from paper checking sessions with the wordplay &quot;for your learning benefits&quot; which means &quot;never expect to argue for marks&quot;.<br />As for the rest 10%, Lai will take attendance randomly with all kinds of tests and written materials, but a TA will also show up immediately and lock you inside the LT right after the quizzes asking you to join their researches if you want your participation mark.<br />The letter grade has not come out yet. I got +0.8sd in quiz 1 and 1.8 in quiz 2. But now, they just post an 'I' high up there on the SIS, which means 'incomplete', I wonder what their loss will be if they keep the status 'in progress'. I am applying for a program and need the transcript where their 'I' is currently written because of Lai's confusing behavior.<br />It seems that the teaching team is making you uncomfortable with the psychology tricks they have a good command of.",

            "comment_workload": "A little bit heavy.<br />The assignments require a lot of references and concrete examples. You need to cope with the topic comprehensively in order to get a good mark.<br />Since the lecture notes only cover about 1/3 of the content on textbook, you have to spend plenty of time reading the textbook. Each chapter has 40+ pages on average. Please note that the last lecture(psychological disorder) combines two chapters on the textbook. The total number of pages of the required reading for this lecture is 80+ pages, but the instructor assigned the reading just two days before Quiz 2! I think at least 40% of the quiz questions are based on the content uncovered by the lecture notes. So required reading is really important if you want a good grade!<br />A REMINDER: please do not get deceived by the sample quizzes the instructor gave!!!! The format of the questions in the sample quizzes is quite different from the questions in formal quizzes!!!",

To be honest, I think even if you do not read the book, you should be able to get at least 80% of total score. The concepts appear only in the textbook are not that many.<br />My suggestion is, if you do not want to put much effort and want to get A range, try this way. No textbook, try to be as familiar with the notes as possible. ^_^",

As he is a local, you can just ask him in Cantonese. <br /><br />The class was very interactive. Nicolson always ask for student's engagement though i didn't answer any of his questions throughout the whole course XD. This style is good because it helps consolidate the concept and remember it.<br /><br />Though attendance for lectures is not required, there is no recording provided for this course. Therefore, I strongly suggest you attend every class because it is saving your time in doing revision. All the concepts tested in exams are well illustrated during lectures.

There are also questions asking about the contents of video clips which are only played in the lectures and not accessible in Canvas. Though I attended all the lectures, there are no ways I can revise them before the exams.<br /><br />Among the worst are questions like in which year explicitly homosexuality was no longer regarded as a psychological disorder in the DSM, or questions like in which option most students in the lecture hall raised their hands... WHAT THE FUCK!!! Who would the heck spend time memorizing these stupid facts?<br /><br />Eva simply likes to ask any random fact in the lecture notes and videos which seem to deviate a lot from the main points she conveyed in class. Thus, you'd better look into EVERY random fact hidden in the lecture notes during your revision, even though she didn't even mention in class.<br /><br />Exams mean were pretty high.<br />✏️ 1st exam: 40 / 50 (20%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean = 36.9 / 50<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD = 5.86<br />✏️ 2nd exam: 42 / 50 (20%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean = 38.35 / 50<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD = 5.99<br />✏️ Essay: 12 / 12 (30%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean = 9.79 / 12<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD = 1.79<br />✏️ 3rd exam: 41 / 50 (20%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean = 35.06 / 50<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD = 6.21<br />🏫 Research Participation: 10/10 (10%)<br />🏫 1 bonus mark for attendance in the writing workshop.<br /><br />Overall: 90.2%<br />💯 Final Grade: A<br /><br />Year 1 students need to beware the high mean score and a lot of competitive fellow students who take this course in the final year. You know my feeling when I faced fierce competition from the senior students - a common problem when year-1 students aren't supposed to be able to enroll in such a popular course. So DON'T be excited when u luckily manage to have a place in the class as a year-1 student. It's actually the beginning of ur nightmare... One of my friends got C+ and another friend got a D cuz they got well below mean in the essay.",
            "comment_workload": "Heavy workload if you don't like writing, but otherwise it's gonna be a piece of cake for you.<br /><br />It requires you to submit an 800-word essay addressing several questions or issues raised by an essay prompt. Integration of concepts from different lectures is required and you definitely have to spend much time on it. Sometimes the situation is quite ambiguous and you might have to burn your brain to make sure EVERY concept in the essay is correctly applied. If any wrong concept appears, your essay will definitely score VERY low. The word limit cannot be exceeded or otherwise marks deducted, and you'll have to address all the questions thoroughly with concrete examples, evidence and some research within the word limit. I spent so much time in cutting the number of words and it was a nightmare. But at the end the essay turned out to be the savior of my grade.<br /><br />In addition to the essays, there are a total of three exams. Though they are all MC questions, it doesn't mean the exams are easy. I spent several weeks on revising the lecture ppts but still did not get a very good result in the exams.<br /><br />As a tip of ur revision, cuz all exams are in MCs, there is no need for u to completely memorize all those fancy terms and names. All u need to do is to recognize the first 3 alphabetical letters of each name and as soon as u can recognize and differentiate different concepts, and u understand wut they are, then u're done. It all tests ur ability to RECOGNIZE but not RECALL.<br /><br />Another component of the course is research participation which accounts for 10% of the course grade. It was the worst sh!t of my life cuz it was really hard to enroll in one. After I received the research email I immediately rushed to the SONA website to register, but still... DAMN!!! &quot;Timeslot is already full...&quot; You can never imagine why all the other people can grab all the places sooooo FAST!!!",
