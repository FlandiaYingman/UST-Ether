            "comment_teaching": "A for Huang, F for Su, so mean grade is D :)<br />The first half was taught by Prof. Huang and the second part is Prof. Su.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of them are very nice and they eager to help us to clarify all the concept. Sad to say that the teaching skills of Prof Su is really a piece of ___ coz nobody understand what he is talking about when he is teaching configuration interaction, he even need help from those post-doc students [Best TA award to Prof. Su :) ]. So, good luck when you meet him in the lecture.",

            "comment_workload": "As the second half of the course require self-reading due to the poor presentation by Prof. Su, it is quite a heavy workload as the second half is the most difficult part, especially for the content in the natural orbital and the density matrices. Seems nobody understand perturbation theory because he rushed this topic within 10 mins. Horrifying.",
