Through a close reading (4 to 8 pages per week) and analysis of short selections from classic texts in world philosophies, the course will help build students’ skills at careful reading, interpretation, and argumentation, while expanding understanding of issues and approaches in Eastern and Western philosophy and culture.<br />Focusing in particular on key Chinese, Indian, and Western sources, we will investigate these three questions: (1) what does it mean to be human? (2) How should I live my life? (3) What can I know? Through background lectures, short videos, close readings, tutorials, and in‐class discussions, the class will examine: (a) the cultural and philosophical ideas and values expressed in these sources and (b) their historical contexts, contemporary relevance, and their significance for comparative and inter-cultural understanding.",

Of course you could skip them, BUT THE QUIZZES ARE BASED ON THE READINGS. Furthermore, a lot of the readings provided are scans, so it got a low resolution and make it difficult to read. The century old style of writing does not help either. Do not forget, a lot of philosophers are not rigid scientists, so the writing structures in their work is such a pain to look at.

Refer to the attached document for topics included.<br /><br />Overall I would consider the content as interesting as it raise questions on the justification of some concepts which we assume to be true, for example why can we assure the knowledge we know must be true? However do note that some concepts involved might be quite abstract and difficult to understand. Also ensure your English proficiency required is quite high for academic reading of philosophical papers or you will suffer from inability to understand the reading materials.",
            "comment_teaching": "I would describe him as a mediocre professor. His speaks with monotone so people may fall asleep easily in his lecture. However content wise he did make his best attempt to translate the abstract concepts to real-life examples and explain the contents in detail. Overall I would say his strength is in content while his weakness is in his teaching style.<br /><br />On the other hand, the TA (LAW, Chun Yin) out-stands from most other TA I have met. He gives great details to some difficult concepts in the canvas discussion. He is also very patient in answering students questions, so if you have any confusion about the contents, please feel free to ask him.<br /><br />P. S. 1. Indeed the professor tried to make the lecture more interactive by raising some questions and expecting students volunteer to answer. However in my point of view, the nature of Hong Kong educational system makes Hong Kong people feel shy to answer questions in class, so only very few responded to his questions.<br /><br />P. S. 2. The TA is very willing to give advices on the final essay",

There are 4 quizzes throughout the whole semester, each worth 10%. Since each quiz has 10 questions, equivalently we have 1% per question and the loss of one mark in the quizzes might result in significant change in the final grade. Moreover, some questions in quizzes test the ability to differentiate minor changes in text and traps people easily.<br /><br />3.
