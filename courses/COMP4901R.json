            "comment_teaching": "Fun. Good. Professor really taught well. Not being able to fully follow the lecture is totally normal. Professor already tried his best to provide intuitions for those concepts that weren't obvious. The proofs in the textbook often skipped steps that shouldn't be obvious for readers without math/ computer theory background. Professor's teaching did a great job. You just gotta be patient.",
            "comment_grading": "60% assignments. 40% final.<br />92.3 total grade. Got A-.<br /><br />Strict grade policy: 90~ A- guarantee; 80~90 B-; etc. <br />Professor said he would consider curve if below expectations. It was a small class (17 students enrolled) so Professor is kind to give out better grades. <br /><br />TBH, I felt the course was deliberately designed to let students get higher score. <br /><br />Take other COMP2000 level courses for example. The level of difficulty of the course content can be described as &quot;knowing your ingredients&quot;. And the assignments be like &quot;following instruction steps to make a dish&quot;. And the exams be like &quot;create your own dish yourself under time constraints&quot;.<br /><br />However, it felt completely opposite for this course. The content was pretty hard to understand and digest. Topics like &quot;auction mechanisms&quot; as well as &quot;voting systems&quot;, a normal 1.5 hour zoom video lecture took me 3 hrs to complete, as I had to pause and digest the concepts to continue. The assignments were just ok. If you had the ability to understand the lectures, then the assignments just tests you the applications of these theories. At most 2 out of the 5 questions from the assignments require extra thinking/ math maturity. The average score for an easy hw was 80~85. Harder ones were 70~75. Final exam was super easy. It was open book and take home. Besides, there were 3 days for us to finish, which means it was basically untimed. The questions in the exams were just as simple as the assignments. Some were easier given the fact during exams it was already not our first time applying the theories and proofs.",
            "comment_workload": "Moderate for summer. 6 hw's total.1 hw for each week, which converted to normal semester means 1 hw every 2 weeks. <br />The first one and the last one took me about 2 days of thinking and half day to write out the solutions. The others can be completed in one day definitely. <br /><br />總結：對game thoery有興趣的人，電腦理論有興趣的人，一堂可以刷龜的課。教授非常仁慈可愛。",
