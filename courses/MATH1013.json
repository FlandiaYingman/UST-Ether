            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Lam's English is clear, and he is willing to answer student's questions. However, his writes on the whiteboard in a less organised way, so it's not easy to follow. The teaching pace is slow, and he put too much time on explaining the fundamental knowledge that both M1 and M2 and even DSE Maths core should have covered, especially functions... He should have put more efforts on new topics such as L'Hopital Rule and more...<br /><br />Mr. Kong's tutorial is better, at least he can demonstrate the examples clearly and remind us some important steps/tips in solving problems.<br /><br />I think attending tutorial is more important than attending lecture. I skip most lectures that teaches M2 stuff.",

Apart from the first one you will need 2-4 hours to finish one, not very heavy workload. You can attempt questions infinitely many times , so try your best to get full marks in them!<br />No attendance required for any lecture and tutorials<br />Exam: Do your best in the relatively simple mid-term to secure a better grade earlier. All contents will appear in final exam, so don't forget to practice on evaluating limits for the final. I focused too much on integration and didn't do a single question of limits before the final, so I lose at least 9 marks on some relatively simple limit MCs, sigh~~",

He always spends a lot of time to prove theories like how chains rule arises which is very useless for exams but if you really like maths, you maybe happy with him. His accent is okay, but he is not good at English! He only repeats a few words in class like “for example… similarly…so..”. However don’t worry! He will write everything he want to speak on the iPads ! I really appreciate for his teaching method, which is concise and clear. However the content is some how useless, only some basic examples and applications also many theories. So we have to find other exercises&nbsp;&nbsp;for extra practices. Actually I could understand all the class materials and all the homework assignments but I still got very poor grade on the final exam and midterm.<br /><br />For the Tutorial session,<br />Dr. Tam is form Hong Kong, he always speaks Cantonese in class. I didn’t attend the tutorial session after the first session because Dr. Tam, is very Irresponsible! He even said “唔識唔好嚟問我” and then just gave us some exercises… for me which is a M1 student, totally don’t understand what is L'Hôpital's rule and some trigonometry identities which M2 syllabus included. However he assume we all know and need to apply them in order to solve the first tutorial session’s exercises! So I didn’t go to tutorial session anymore.",

It is 35% of your course grade but only has 10 multiple-choice questions which means 3.5 marks will be deducted in your overall for every wrong question.<br />I got 5/10 in the midterm exam. I was shocked. I mean noway. I did well in calculus throughout high school and HKDSE. However, with all the self-doubt and disappointment you must encounter in your study journey in HKUST, don't give up easily. I practice more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the computation techniques required and studied in an exam oriented way. Finally, I got 85/100 in my final exams. <br />This is known as one of the poor grading courses because most people fall within the mean which is around sixty something and will get a C to C+. Therefore, all the hard work is worth it to chase back a B range. For your reference, my overall is 75/100 (B).<br />Reflection:<br />1. I was too confident<br />They are topics that you have faced in high school before, creating an illusion of simple. The fact is that you may have been treated mathematics as calculations but what I've learned in this course is that math is more about definitions and fundamental theorems. You should know what is a continuous function, a differentiable function, a integrable function, an invertible function even they were not asked directly in your exams. Also notice limit of a function with absolute sign could be very tricky.<br />2. Wrong direction<br />No much proof. You can ignore trig. However, the sandwich thm. intermediate value thm. mean value thm. would be useful. Just bear in mind.<br />3. No calculators allowed<br />Tbh, most of the careless mistakes could have eliminated if it is allowed. Anyway, no excuse as it is fair to everybody. Just memories all the special angles if you think it helps.<br />4. Don't compare yourself to others<br />People around you may put less effort to have better results than you but it has never changed the fact that you have to be a better me. As long as you focus on your own goal, no matter all odds, you must have way to do it. I didn't got A/A+ but I have made myself proud already.",

FYI, I got 5* in M1 and 5* in core. <br /><br />When I first got in UST, people kept saying good luck to me for this course. I was like, no way, I'm pretty good at math, it should be alright. Ended up I got a C+ lol.<br /><br />But hey, I think I deserve getting this grade. UST is all about EARNING your own grade. I just overestimated myself. I only attended the first 2 lectures and the first tutorial. Yes, I skipped all the rest. <br /><br />First few lectures, the content is pretty easy to understand. Since I found the lecturer accent hard to understand, and I felt like tutorial is just doing exercise that will be uploaded later on, I skipped all of them. <br /><br />Obviously I was not as disciplined as I expected, I ended up only studying the materials just before webwork due. The chapters that I'm not familiar with piled up and I ended up not fully understanding them. <br /><br />Mid-term was not hard and I got 65/100 because I didn't even managed to understand how to do some of the question in past papers. Final I deadline-fighted in the library for one day only. So I got 60/100 at the end.<br /><br />I feel like I was just using my old knowledge from M1 about calculus to get this grade. I do feel bad about getting a bad math grade, so I'm trying to pick up the exercises and finish them in this winter term, hoping at least it'll be less hard to catch up with MATH1014. Let's see how I'll be doing if I work harder. See you in MATH1014 comment and Wish you good luck!!",

I don't know why he always seems to be in a rush and has to scroll a little lower which hides his previous notes but does not write anything new in the blank space. He does not like writing on the bottom of his iPad so he will scroll up and continue (which hides the notes again). If he hadn't put the Zoom recordings and notes on Canvas, I would have been more disappointed. His writing is a bit hard to read though.<br />Mr. Huang's lessons this semester were at 09:00-10:20 every Tuesday and Thursday so it was not the best time for students to be concentrated during the lessons. Mr. Huang also spends too much time proving theorems. Despite the rapid pace in lessons, he is behind schedule. <br />The good thing about Mr. Huang is that he is very responsive when it comes to asking questions via email. He even replies during weekends. <br />His accent is alright. You can understand what he is saying.<br /><br />There are two tutorial teaching assistants (TA) in Huang Meng's course. I was in tutorial A which was taught by TA Mr. He Jiafa. The tutorials became pretty boring and not very useful later on. The earliest tutorials talked about the homework solutions and steps before their deadlines so it helps students finish their assignments. The tutorials then became reviewing concepts covered in lectures with some in-class exercises but there were too simple compared with the assignments and exams. The progress of the tutorials and lectures also do not match; tutorials can get ahead of lectures or behind them. We failed to cover integration and the important theorems. <br />According to my classmate, the other TA's tutorials are used for drilling exercises but the questions are likely to be out-syllabus. That is why the tutorials are not helpful at all. <br /><br />They do not take attendance in both lectures and tutorials so you can choose whether you would like to attend them or not.<br /><br />If you do not attend his lectures and only do revision on your own, then his class will be alright for you. If you really need to learn in his class, then it may not be a good choice.",

First of all, he should be able to pronounce each word concisely and clearly. However, you may find it confusing by listening to Mr. Huang Meng's pronunciation. For instance, he pronounces &quot;absolute&quot; with 5 syllables (ab/bu/su/la/de), &quot;odd function&quot; into &quot;other funcshin&quot;. Moreover, his voice is too soft that I can't hear him even though he is using a microphone during the whole course.

If you have the same mindset, you would find his lecture quite boring, and honestly I give up listening to him after a few lectures.<br /><br />However, you would definitely like the TA's tutorial sessions. Her notes are so good: Clear outline, comprehensive and quite difficult exercises (some are adopted from past exams). The best part is when explaining the concepts or theorems, her notes can present in an easy-to-understand format, which is good enough for you to understand in order to cope with the exam. She also likes to check if there are any students encountering difficulty doing the questions, and is willing to answer any questions.

Luckily, the questions in exams are not very difficult but you need to BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE DETAILS in your solution. Sadly, I always skipped some steps or didn't follow the standard step of mathematical induction in exams. So although I got the correct answer or my method of proving is correct, I lost 5~8 points in both exams and it cannot be argued back.",

Attend the tutorials if you like to listen the details. But I was reluctant to attend them except the first month as answers were provided a week later.

He is still a nice guy.<br /><br />He uses his iPad Pro to copy the content from the textbook and illustrate the example to us.<br /><br />Sometimes his accent is hard to understand and I have to ask him to repeat before I can understand.<br /><br />He can answer my questions clearly each time I ask him through email or face-to-face.<br /><br />However, the teaching of the TA is barely acceptable.<br /><br />The TA is called SHI, Zhongyi. He is really boring and I can hardly understand what he said. The interaction level is really low that we are just watching how he uses his iPad to demonstrate the application of the mathematics skills we learn in class in some extremely difficult questions that will never appear in both mid-term exam and final exam.",

If you have been through a math-heavy curriculum like M1/M2 (or like most Asian countries' curriculum), the concepts will be familiar to you and only revising for exercises is needed (tbh, the hardest questions on MATH1013 exams are still easier than some questions on my national high school graduation exam in math). Otherwise, chances are that you may struggle, but self-studying through Youtube or Khan Academy may be really helpful.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching was a bit boring (maybe since I've already dealt with these contents in high school) but in general prof Wang seems to be among the better instructors.<br /><br />Indeed, in the lectures, the prof goes through the contents and exercises at a steady pace so it is not hard to catch up with her. Her notes are really detailed and organized. She has a mainland accent but generally easy to follow. Prof. Wang is also really nice, so a bit sad that only about 1/3 students regularly attend her lectures.<br /><br />Tutorials were not as good as the tutor in my section organizes his notes poorly (he writes and draws everything using his bad handwriting, so the notes look quite unattractive, especially the graphs). His accent is bad. The only good thing about tutorials is that there are more advanced exercises not covered during lectures, which you can utilize for self-studying (though a few problems in exams can be even more difficult than that)",

There might be hard questions, which you might want to consult with your friends, ask your tutor/prof or go to the Math Support Centre to get help for.<br /><br />Midterm in previous years have a mix of MCs and long questions, but for my year there were only 10 MCs, so 1 mistake can cost you 3.5 points in the final grade. I also agree with previous reviews that there should be more questions in the midterm.<br /><br />The final exam has a mix of MCs and long questions (for my year, 19 MCs and 3 long questions). Not too difficult. I finished everything, reviewed all the questions and submitted after just 2 hrs.<br /><br />Previous reviews suggest that this course uses absolute grading.<br /><br />My scores:<br />Assignments: 100 (mean: 92.85)<br />Midterm: 90 (mean: 57.79)<br />Final: 97 (mean: 66.44)<br />Total: 94.85 (mean: 66.05)<br />Grade: A+",

I believe I still remember how to associate them<br /><br />Also I remember that he said something like don't be fixated on grades you get on this course because in years you could be a master mathematician. That made me respect him much more.<br /><br />I think a funny thing is sometimes how scientifically he speaks.

Although sometimes he may not give you the full answer, it is still a good opportunity to learn. In zoom semester, he used his iPad to write his notes, and he will upload his handwritten notes later on. I think it is not enough by just reading his notes, you have to read the textbook at the same time. I think for M1 students, you can try to start reading the textbook (can be found online, or maybe you can try the attached notes below) or start to review the calculus part of your M1 syllabus. Prof Li is really a good professor, I remember he posted an additional zoom lecture for students who have not learnt&nbsp;&nbsp;radian measures (in DSE M2 only). <br /><br />The TA, Leung Ho Ming is also good.

Since I studied M1 in the past, there was a heavier workload for me comparing to other M2 students.<br /><br />For the WeBWorK assignments, a new exercise was assigned about every week. Each exercise consisted of about 10 questions, some of which were challenging. However, since there were unlimited attempts and no time limits, it was not difficult to get full marks in these assignments. You could search online to find the solutions easily if you didn't understand the question. Just remember to mark down the homework deadlines on a calendar, since the due dates are quite irregular and it is easy to forget completing them before the deadline.<br /><br />For the Midterm and Final exams, they consist of about 20 MC questions and several long questions. No calculators were allowed. It is recommended to finish the sample papers beforehand, which had a similar format comparing to the exam questions. Also, some WebWorK questions were similar to those in the exams, so understanding them also helps you to prepare for the exams.",

Good if you love math so much though.<br /><br />However, I do have to say his TA (Phyllis LIANG) is very good. She explains how to do the questions clearly. Quite exam-oriented as well as she will discuss past exam questions with us during her tutorials. She is very nice and willing to answer questions as well.

Even reading the notes suffice if you are the kind of person who hates to attend lesson. (I did attend every lesson tho)<br /><br />The TA, Kenneth Ng, is really good too.

            "comment_content": "This course is intended to those who studied M1/M2 in the secondary school. It goes back to all the basics of calculus and introduce some minor excluded topics in M1/M2 syllabus, like L'Hopital rule, absolute value inequality and limits, differentiation on weird functions, etc. <br />In general the content is not difficult, but you may find the workload a bit more if you studied M1 in your secondary school life.",
            "comment_teaching": "The Professor just speaks whatever she wrote on the lecture notes. There is no need to attend this professor's lecture as you could already knew what she is about to say.<br />Tutorial maybe useful to who has M1 background, but in general feel free to skip the whole course",
            "comment_grading": "Grading was absolute, Midterm and final exam is not very difficult to a ordinary student.<br />I would say the grading is at it's best when you consider some students are able to get 100 marks in the midterm and final exams.

The most challenging part would be the concept of limits, so you may want to put more effort in this topic.<br />For the final exam, you have to finish 18 mc questions and 3 long questions within 3 hours. Each mc question worths 3 marks while each long question worths around 14-16 marks.<br />People say that the grade of this course is determined on an absolute basis but I asked my professor about the grading mechanism and he said our grades were determined on a relative basis. Anyway, work hard to secure a satisfactory grade.<br />For your reference, I got full marks in all assignments and the mid-term exam. However, I screwed up in the final exam and I only got 86/100. My overall score was 92.3/100 and I got an A at last. I knew that if I had not lost any mark in the 7-mark question about Riemann sum in the final exam, I must have got an A+. But yeah this might be a punishment for my disrespectful act of skipping lectures and tutorials, and that’s why I have to pay the price. Therefore, do make sure that you understand every concept before you sit for the exams.",

Limit is the most important part for midterm and M2 students are more exposed to it. For trigonometry, though it is a new topic for us, there are not much questions involve in complicated trigonometry during midterm and final. Just understand and recite the basic of trigonometry then you should be fine. After the midterm, the difference between a M1 students and M2 students is limited. <br /><br />If you will like to have more practices on the content, e-book with questions and answers should be provided in the Classviva system. HOWEVER, IF YOU WILL LIKE TO EXCEL IN EXAM, doing past papers is important. If you cannot find answers for the past papers, you can do them with your friends and cross-check with them.",

He should have put more effort into new topics such as L'Hopital Rule and more...<br /><br />Mr. Kong's tutorial is better, at least he can demonstrate the examples clearly and remind us of some important steps/tips in solving problems.<br /><br />I think attending a tutorial is more important than attending a lecture.

            "comment_teaching": "I highly recommend Phyllis. The best tutor so far in UST course I have studied. In tutorial lessons, she will give us her notes and we will go through all the questions. Her notes is simple but extremely easy to understand. The most important thing is that these practices include the questions from past paper and she has arranged the question in a very smart way. After learning the theorem, you do the first question. Just apply the theorem is ok. However, the next question is usually sightly different from the previous one and most of us cannot finish it by just the same method. That's the trap students usually fall into when they are doing exam which makes the concept more clear. IN THE MIDTERM EXAM, AT LEAST HALF of the questions are similar to those in the tutorial notes. Phyllis is nice too and she can speak fluent English which hardly can be found in Math course. I have sent a email to her about her website is not working and she replied me within 30mins together with the soft copy of tutorial notes. I hope she teaches 1014...but seems she is not.<br /><br />Prof. Lam is a very good professor in Math1013. Clear hand writing, fluent English and clear explanations make him the best. Highly recommend to sit his class. Remember to arrive the classroom earlier because you may not get a seat if you are too late.<br /><br />LTK is teaching you to prove the theorems and definitions of them. Phyllis is to teach you how to apply them. One of the problems of Math1013 is that, if the theorem is proved in lectures. You should know how to use it but Professor won't teach you. So attending to Phyllis's tutorial is a must.",

Easy to get full mark if you pay attention to something basic.<br /><br />The final change to online exam. Since it is open-book exam, they don't exam things like tangent approximation or Newton's method because you just simply substitute into the formula and things are done. Instead they examine something quite difficult, the exam is 2 hour long to finish 20 MC questions. The exam is proctored so suppose no one can cheat.

The paper checking session is cancelled due to the events this semester and I do not even know where I got wrong. The final is moved to the first week of the Spring Semester.<br />Update:<br />The format of the final exam is changed into online canvas quiz due to the coronavirus and it consists of multiple choice questions only. The exam is easier than the past since there is sufficient time and the questions are pretty simple but you really need to be careful because 5 points accounts for each of the question. <br />mean of the final: 66<br />I personally got 100 for the final.<br />Overall I got 97.55 for this course and I got an A+.
