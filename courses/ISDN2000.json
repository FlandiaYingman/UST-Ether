        "description": "This course introduces what design is and why it is valued. Design is the purposeful act of creative problem solving. Students learn about fundamental design theories, principles, and methods through a project-based learning approach. Students then experience several stages of a creative design process. The process begins by asking students to identify real-world problems through social, business, scientific, and technological perspectives. To add specificity, students will be able to describe the behaviors and needs of social interactions, observe demographic phenomena, assess business viability, and identify and understand technological changes and impacts, etc. After defining a problem statement, students will be guided to generate creative solutions using brainstorming tools and creative thinking skills. Selected solutions will be presented in form of prototypes and open for user feedback. This course emphasizes the appreciation of the role and significance of design for our society.",

If you have a passion for design and would like to explore more in this area, this course would be good for you. <br /><br />The course introduces what design is and why design. Students understand fundamental design principles and methods, and experience the creative design process through project-based learning. This course focuses on product and service system design.",
            "comment_teaching": "Luisa is very passionate and enthusiastic about design and her job, and she puts in a lot of effort preparing for each class to ensure the content is interesting for students. Her classes are interactive and are engaging, and she often creates many in-class activities that are fun to complete.<br /><br />However, Luisa often forgets what she taught in the previous class and she sometimes would repeat the content. She also has what would be considered as a &quot;藝術家性格&quot; as her comments and ideas vary.",
            "comment_grading": "There are no exams of any type, the grade is determined purely on the work distributed by Luisa every class. Luisa has high standards and does not give a good mark easily. However, she does give a lot of feedback.<br /><br />The final project that is required to complete and takes up the most marks is based on an issue that Luisa finds critical. This year it was &quot;typhoon&quot;, and we had to design and create a device that helps people in a typhoon.",
            "comment_workload": "Often, Luisa would require you to prepare for a presentation, and at the same time, you would have to complete an assignment called &quot;idea paper&quot; which helps to stimulate the creative design process. Personally, I think for people with some artistic skills it would not be hard to complete the assignment.<br /><br />I think we got lucky this year classes got canceled, if it weren't, we would have to create an actual prototype for our design, which would definitely be a pain in the ass.",

You don't have to memorize what you learned in the lecture because there is no midterm and final exam.<br /><br />Every week, you have to show your work progress. You start with analytical sketches of 3 individual objects, extract feature lines from the sketches, recombine feature lines to create an imaginative 2D shape, convert the 2D shape into a 3D shape, and do clay modeling based on your 3D shape. You will do the final presentation on the last day of the course. From this course, you can experience what you might do if you become a designer.",

He usually talks about what he has done as a designer and professor but he also talks about the philosophy of design, various designs of objects, and design education.<br /><br />Professor Axel Thallemer is very enthusiastic during the lecture. However, his lecture is a little bit boring. He always welcomes feedback and question related to his lecture or design. He gives a lot of feedback on our work, but sometimes it may be abstract.",

Just attend the lecture, show your progress in front of your classmates for 3 minutes, and relax while listening to what the professor says...

I have spent at least 3 hours forming a clay model based on my 3D sketch and at least 5 hours smoothing the surface of the clay model with 2 different kinds of sandpaper. The reading assignment also takes some time to complete. The reading materials are too long to read. Writing a 160-200 word \bassignment didn't take a lot of time compared to sketching and clay modeling. Sketching usually took 1 hour for me to complete.",
