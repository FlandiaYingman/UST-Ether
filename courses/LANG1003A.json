            "comment_grading": "The grading scheme is as follows:<br /><br />Part A Multimodal Project (in total 70%):<br />25% - Academic blogs--individual blog posts on academic readings/research&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Academic blog #1: Summary and critique of an article (e.g., magazines, journals)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Academic blog #2: Comparison/critique/synthesis of 2 more articles (e.g., magazines, journals, websites, news) <br />5% - An in-class sharing session of videos draft/storyboard for peers and teacher <br />30% - A group multimodal report with Q&amp;A session based on the synthesis of individual research <br />5% for teamwork <br />5% for peer feedback <br /><br />Part B Self-Directed Learning (in total 30%):<br />10% SDL<br />5% Eletives<br />15% Reflection(3 of them)<br /><br />Final Grade: A<br />Note that I get almost everything full. Except for reflection and academic blog 2. But still thank Yilmaz for his generosity",
            "comment_workload": "This semester I have taken 18 credits and I strongly believe that this 3 credits course has a higher workload than my other 15 credits... <br />I don't mind working on academic blogs or videos or SDL or what. But all of them together??? That's a torture lol. Every week you have to spend like 2 hours working on different SDL (in total 13 of them) and they only account for 10% of the course grade???? Not to mention that there also are &quot;Electives'' that take you another 4 hours which only count 5% towards your grade. <br />Then it comes to the multimodal project. First you have to finish 2 academic blogs, then a storyboard section to somehow share what you are going to do for your video, then finally a 8-minute video that has to be made by yourselves. Though it is a group project, the workload is still immense. Just producing and editing the video can take you 6 hours or above. It is just a pure headache. (Luckily I get very supportive groupmates, if you get some free-riders in your group.....Gosh)<br />So, CLE, please try to fix your course and whoever design this course please be more empathetic to your students and let us be the last sufferers.",

            "comment_content": "The teacher has explicitly told us that this is a pilot, experimental course that is tried for the first time. Nevertheless, I still give my truthful judgement, hope she can take it and seriously improve it for the next gen of students.<br />Yes, the content for this course deserves an E. There's practically nothing to learn other than the &quot;find academic paper&quot; skill that got taught in just one lesson. All the other stuff are just work, like suddenly we just become workers and not students or learners. And we also didn't get taught anything, there are assignments after assignments, SDLs, academic blog, video project, and we just use whatever we have to deal with it. So unironically, from the course what I improve on the most are video editing, time management and pressure management skills, while gaining close to none in my English (or probably even worsen it, given how many time I have to give up on formality just to finish the task and throw it off my head).<br /><br />TLDR: Nothing to learn, you basically are sent to the workforce.",
            "comment_teaching": "Other than her always-cheerful, motivating attitude and just being nice, there's little she managed to teach or at least help us. We were still largely left alone, swimming desperately in this monstrous sea of workload and assignments. At least she gave instructions on what we have to do in time, so well, she got the bare minimum of teacher standard. And at least her cheerful attitude made us work harder than we should be, otherwise, this course would just crumble under extreme anxiety and depression.",
            "comment_grading": "I don't even bother uploading the grading scheme on here, since it is still such a horrendous nightmare that I just want to wipe from my memory and never look back again. They try to divide the grades into the tini tiniest bit detail, and sometimes you have to work so so hard (like 2-3 hours extra) just to gain 1-2% extra grade. Given how meaningless some of the tasks are (I said most of the stuff are plain work and no learning, but some are even more meaningless than others, just a bunch of wasteful bureaucratic work that never will be bothered again), I even ignored some tasks completely, showing my objection to work, thus resulting in my low score (B-). But even without my objection, I think the score is still quite low, given how we are basically turned into lab rat, and the instructor had promised lenient score for us.<br /><br />TLDR: The grading is terrible, both on the scheme and the final letter score.",
            "comment_workload": "From the three other sections, you probably could already imagine what the workload looks like. And for me, the guy who carried the whole storyboarding and video editing section of the group, I just got a once-in-a-lifetime experience *haha very funny*. I must have spent 100-odd hours for every mini tasks and microservices embedded in this course, and for the first time in my life, I worked for 30+ hours straight, no sleep (basically skip 2 nights), simple eating and a few short 10-minute breaks. In class when I have to present our video, my mouth doesn't even work properly lol, and after the class ended, I rammed onto bed and basically got blackouted for the next 8 hours of my life. Feels like a total war really, and I barely won, at the expense of being torn apart both physically and mentally. Luckily I'm still young and got recovered from that to combat the rest of the finals :v<br /><br />TLDR: Simply torture lol, if this course got prolonged, probably even worse than 996. At least 996 workers still work for sth meaningful, but all our work... is for what??",

Although the class is often quiet, he will try to encourage us to speak. Maybe because this is A class? He seldom teaches by running through the course book. Instead of that, he usually shares videos and holds breakout groups for small group discussion. I think this is better than just cramming the course book into my brain so I like it.",
            "comment_grading": "Due to the COVID-19, this sem has changed into online teaching. Some of the task is cut. Also, some parts of the ELPA is cancelled. As a result, the grading scheme is also rearranged.<br /><br />Grading scheme of this sem:<br />Participation: 10%<br /><br />Writing (Beauty): 30%<br />It looks like that this sem they added a new task called &quot;Essay Writing Process&quot;. Aside from the essay, you also have to write and submit several writing plans and reflection. This task is actually testing your sincerity so it is easy to get full mark.<br /><br />Speaking (Happiness): 20%<br />For this sem, the individual talk is cut. You only need to do group discussion.<br /><br />Vocab related : 20%<br />a) Vocab test 1: 5%<br />b) Vocab test 2: 10%<br />c) Vocab learning record (VLR): 5%<br /><br />The VLR is a new task, but actually nothing special. Just do 4 &quot;Word Banks&quot;, each time with 20 vocab. This task is also testing your sincerity so it is easy to get full mark comparing to those two vocab tests<br /><br />ELPA: 20%<br />For this sem, reading, listening and vocab parts are cut. You only have to take writing and speaking test. Testing format is similar to original one but imagine all things are done through computer and Internet XD<br /><br />My performance:<br />Writing: 6 6 5 4 (reference +1)<br />Essay Writing Process: 4/4<br />Speaking: 5 5 5<br />Vocab test 1: 15/20<br />Vocab test 2: 27.5/30 (This time only has 30 questions) <br />VLR: 4/4<br />Participation: Unknown, maybe 3/4 ?<br />ELPA writing: 6 5 5 <br />ELPA speaking: 6 5 5 5<br /><br />Final grade: A<br /><br />No complaint, very good grade. I am really touching and surprised that I can get an A in an English course since my English is trash (Especially speaking since I usually suffer from speech anciety...). I think at least I have to get some 7s and overall 6 so that I can get A. Overall 5 can get A is really out of my expectation, I only expect it is A- or even B+. Mark is really kind in grading so try to do your work seriously, show (at least act...) your enthusiasm and give him good impression.",
            "comment_workload": "Although the instructor is kind, he will give some extra reading and listening exercise to you every week so the workload is a little bit heavier to other class. Actually they are said &quot;optional&quot; so you can choose not to do but your impression and participation mark will very likely be in danger. Therefore, consider very carefully. Also, they are not very long and complex. If you are efficient enough, you may finish them within 1-2 hours so indeed the workload is still ok.<br /><br />Nevertheless, those reading materials are actually sometimes useful. I also cited several reading passage into my writing. They can really help you to develop some ideas in your writing and speaking assessment. Therefore, try to treasure them and treat them well.",

So is reasonable for him to have rather strict teaching. <br />Another good thing about him, is that he would actually skip some unnecessary sections in the textbook, which makes the teaching more efficient. (By the way, this is ONLY written for the 2018-19 term, as the textbook we received is more for those who are in the weaker I or S stream, and instructor mentioned that the textbooks would now be made specifically for each of the three streams, meaning there will be a textbook for the A stream, meaning there is the chance that you guys might not receive this privilege)<br />The only thing I dislike is that he can talk pretty awkward, as he might stutter at times.",

The second ELPA test actually determines how much improvement you made in the past.<br />Overall, I received an A-.

In this course, most of the assignments and activities are related to the group project, including two academic blogs, a storyboard, and a video with multimodality elements followed by a 3 minutes presentation (mainly for the conclusion and Q&amp;A). To be honest, I don't see how dealing with multimodality elements (such as creating an animation or editing a video) is related to learning English. It is not only meaningless but also adds extra burdens to students.<br />Other than the content related to the group project, there're also many other assignments that are mostly useless for English learning, including but not limited to the tasks in Perusall, the &quot;learning to learn&quot; tasks and the electives, as well as the electives.",
            "comment_teaching": "The only reason I give an A for this terrible course in this criteria is due to my tutor: Mariah Chan. Not only that she's really kind and will try her best to make the tutorials less boring, but she also understands students' burden under the unreasonable workload of this course, giving students assistance whenever they need it. And most importantly, her gradings are reasonable and she's really efficient at replying students' emails. I strongly suggest you to swap to her classes if you expect better learning experiences in this course.",

You have to finish one or more tasks on Perusall or other platforms almost every week, depending on the timetable. You also have to spend time making a video with ideally 3 or more multimodality elements for your group project. Not to mention that you're also required to complete 3 reflection tasks at the end of this course, which accounts for 5% of the scores in total. Yes, you have to write two short articles and make a presentation to explain how &quot;useful&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; this course is after suffering from it!! Just to get those 15% scores!!!!! Since the course grading of LANG1003 is based on the curve, you might get a poor grade if you don't complete them. So you have no choices.",

I feel that May was more open-ended, positive reinforcement with feedback and creative with teaching, Carmel was more rich and positively constructive. Personally I felt I learned a lot when Carmel taught us because she gives really good advice and suggestions, like I felt like it was more like a university course when I was taught by her.

            "comment_content": "The topics for this course, as usual, are Beauty and Happiness. Well I have to say the topic itself is quite boring. And usually I don't expect to learn anything from LANG couses. <br /><br />But polung's classes actually do help us improve some of the English skills. Details will be covered in &quot;teaching&quot;",
            "comment_teaching": "Polung is an exceedingly humorous person, and he often makes jokes during class so the class atomosphere is absolutely amazing. ( BTW the jokes are sometimes about &quot;bonus mark for grades, etc.&quot; ) We know he is just kidding but it turns out the grading is indeed very lenient. <br /><br />The best part about his teaching is that he explains the assignments (essay, speaking and all that) in a remarkablely detailed manner. Especially for the essay, his explanation really helped us to prepare for the essay and learn something about how to struct, plan, and polish an essay. This is the first time I feel I actually leant something from LANG courses. So Polung is absolutely a professional, responsible and helpeful LANG instructor. <br /><br />(BTW his email replys are usually very rapid, basically if you ask him a question on email during the day, you can be expecting a reply within 30 min)",
            "comment_grading": "Epic Grading!<br /><br />I don't know if this is just because this is the A stream course, but even for an A-stream course his grading is still very lenient.<br /><br />I really dont think our performance in assignments were that good, but as far as I know, many students in our section got many 6s or even 7s in our assignments. I don't know other students' letter grade, but since many students had similar gradings in those assignments, and I ended up with A+, they most probs got at least an A or A+ as well.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say the workload is lighter than LANG1002s, but maybe this depends on instructors. Polung seldom gives us out-of-class HWs to do. Prehaps just a few practices to do during the essay writing process. But TBH those practices are more than helpful and really made us prepare better for the essay. Other than this, the overall workload is relatively light for a LANG course.",

However, according to the instructor, the contents will probably change after 2 years, so this review may become invalid by then.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think the contents will help much academically. I mean, unless you're from SHSS, you probably won't even see these topics later in your university life (I think).<br /><br />The related tasks, such as the essay writing, may however be a useful one as it helps developing good habits for academic writings.",

A very knowledgeable person, he also knows a lot about different cultures.<br /><br />In every lesson, he'd set up a few breakout room activities, primarily group discussions on various topics. He would also come to different breakout rooms to help facilitate our discussions if necessary, and also give some opinions on our points.<br /><br />The learning atmosphere is actually quite relaxed in his class.<br /><br />I can guarantee that you'll learn a lot from Mark.

The other 25% is assessed in terms of the content, organization, vocabulary, and grammar.<br /><br />Academic Discussion: 25%<br />The instructor will ask 2 questions that are not necessarily related to beauty and happiness. Then you will have to respond for around a minute.<br /><br />Vocabulary: 10%<br />In this part, you have to complete all the vocabulary tests on VOLT and also submit a reflection on your learning progress.<br /><br />ELPA: 30%<br />This part consists of a reading, writing, and speaking test. The speaking test will be in the format of a group discussion. The discussion topic should be on the topic of happiness.<br /><br />My letter grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is not really heavy. The biggest task is the academic essay as it requires thorough research on your topic.<br /><br />The instructor often gives out-of-class work for us to do over the weekend. They are usually follow-up questions for TED Talks or other YouTube videos on the topic of beauty or happiness. Some of these tasks are compulsory, some are optional. I really recommend to complete all the given extra tasks, regardless of whether they are compulsory. This is because they may really help you for the essay writing, and the ELPA tests.",

For example, conducting a small-scale survey, group discussions about the vocabulary collations before vocabulary quiz, etc.<br /><br />She also makes use of the technologies to help us to learn English effectively. For example, she told us to set up a Padlet page that stores all our findings of the topics, using Flipgrid to practice for individual presentation (ELPA speaking), and introduces us Vocabulary.com and Quizlet cards for vocabulary learning for vocabulary quizzes.<br /><br />Rosie also gives useful and detailed feedback to students, that she points out what we can do better.",

Thus, you have to manage time well if you want to strive for good grades while bearing the work of other courses at the same time. For example, the course requires us to hand in the essay by the end of week 7. For Rosie's class, we have to finish the full essay *draft* before the first lesson of week 6.<br /><br />However, it is understandable that she doesn't want us to become 'deadline fighters' for the essay and at last, the essay came out horrible.",

Benjamin does not care what you do in class and would just give you a good participation mark.",

Benjamin would suggest some assignments for you to do, maybe doing some research, reading some articles, or doing some exercises in the textbook before the next lesson. But he really does not care about whether you did it all not. He once said that we should only do the assignments if we think that they would be useful. I personally do not find any of them to be useful. :)",

Considering the fact many other lecturers don't do this, Melissa actually cares about the learning progress of the students. This is actually a very useful session since you can get very good feedback from Melissa and learn from your mistakes, and of course, Melissa is more than willing to answer the questions.<br /><br />Melissa's teaching style is not boring at all as she always try to get students engaged by asking questions, or even inviting some students to speak during class.

She let you peer up with other classmate to read each others' writing and give opinion. <br /><br />After marking the essay, she will once again talk to each student in class to tell them what to improve and areas to work on. --&gt; super nice!!!!!!!<br /><br />BTW, for essay writing, she will give your his checklist for you to ensure you get everything right and I REALLY like those papers she gave for essay organization( Topic sentence. Main writing, conclusion) etc. <br /><br />For Grp Discussion, she will help you a lot in class time, which can nicely prep you for the real discussion.<br /><br />BTW please help her with splitting the grp in class for practice grp!!!!!",

On top of the usual timed talks that you are asked to pair up and share views on a given topic for 1-2mins, there are group discussions throughout the semester to prepare you for the group discussion assessed task at the end of the semester (more on that in workload) Nth more than assessed tasks and she is very exam-oriented and give clear instructions on every tasks several weeks ago to prepare you. And of course, she has high expectations on you. But generally, it is easy to achieve as long as you attend optional consultations to seek for her advice especially for the writing assessment as you are asked to come up with your own topic and thesis statement. A good start leads to a good grade.<br />And yes, it is &quot;optional&quot; but I can tell you it is almost mandatory for impression marks as well as tips from her.

They are pretty easy and you can just finish it within 5 mins before lessons. <br /><br />For assessed tasks, go to consultation for tips. Apply skills learnt from textbook (see how Melissa comments on the samples). They are not perfect but you can see how melissa judges their writing. <br /><br />For speaking assessed task, you have to pitch an idea to improve happiness. Just come up with a pretty innovative idea to impress Melissa and see how people pitch. As it is a group task, after introducing your own ideas by taking turns (like dse chin), you are asked to discuss in a group and reach a consensus. In the group part, to obtain higher grades, you have to have substance in what you are talking about and you are allowed to take a reference sheet for that. For your reference, I didn't write my pitch script there I just wrote indicators of Gross National Happiness and the reasons why people in Finland are happy. I used them and Melissa was impressed.<br /><br />For participation, just stay active and she will remember you. <br /><br />For Elpa, go on elpa website to see the grading rubrics before attending the exam. You will be fine.<br /><br />Overall, pretty easy considering that I only spent one whole day for the writing assessed task (880 words max) and two hours for the group discussion.<br /><br />Lastly, look at the grading rubrics for every task as Melissa follows it closely.

A 5% participation (based on how actively student contributes) mark is included as well.",

She tries hard in leading the discussion but it is often too general and fails to involve in-depth analysis.<br /><br />Sue's instructions and explanations can be seldom misleading and unclear. Her comments for the writing assessment can be unhelpful, as she merely notes &quot;not understood&quot; and does not clarify what she meant (the room for the writing improvement is thus quite limited). She sometimes also seems to be confused with the assessment requirements (the writing assessment, in particular). Be cautious differentiating the written instructions on Canvas and the ones told by her. Should students are informed with the wrong instructions, it is still their responsibility to check which ones are actually correct. <br /><br />Sue often seems to forget about her teaching plan and is frequently confused about the teaching sections. <br /><br />Overall, Sue is a casual lecturer but also a potentially detrimental teacher to learners with insufficient English background. She is suited for students who are already decently capable English learners.",

Sue suggests doing some out of classwork (on Canvas) help students working towards ELPA, but these are resources supposedly for independent exercises. Sue occasionally assigns short reading comprehension materials that will take 10-20 minutes. On the other hand, students are implicitly expected to study what they lack in the ELPA criteria. This should be considered the most important because ELPA exam is what ultimately determines the final grade. Hence, depending on how one performed in the ELPA mock exam, the workload is different.",

            "comment_grading": "One of the only things I like about this course is that it's an easy A course. <br /><br />There'll be one essay where you get to choose your own thesis so in a way you're deciding your own grade for this, just make sure it's not too complicated or too simple. As long as you follow the rubrics and you have adequate amount of relevant references, you should get a pretty decent mark for it. <br />There will also be a group discussion at the end of the semester which is graded in two parts. One for an individual portion where before the group discussion, you'll be assigned a topic and you'll be required to speak for 1/2 (I forgot) minutes about it. As long as you contribute enough and whatever you said is relevant to the conversation and backed up by some examples/references, you should be able to get a pretty good mark for it. <br />Again, there will be 3 vocabulary tests where it should be an easy 15-20% to get for your grade. This semester, however, they caught a few students cheating and hence decided to allocate the 20% to the essay, discussion and ELPA component of the grade. <br />Finally is ELPA where you'll have to prepare for it on your own as the lesson time will not prepare you for it and ELPA holds quite a hefty chunk of your grade so you'll need to perform well enough there to get into the A range.<br /><br />Andddd, there's also attendance. Same rules as in LANG 1002A.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload for this course is once again kind of average. We had some in-class assignments where either some of the students didn't do it and we would check it some other time or the instructor would end up forgetting about it. <br /><br />Then there's the essay in which you'll need to spend some time on as you'll be developing your thesis statement followed by doing some research about it and also extracting some relevant examples and references from legit sources. All of this will take some time so I highly recommend that you start on it sooner rather than pushing it aside and doing it last minute.",

It makes her lectures comfortable enough to attend. She also enjoyed chatting with us and provoked us to speak up and speak more which is indeed essential in ELPA Speaking. Probably because people in my class were very active and talkative, there was hardly any boredom in every lesson and we had nearly no lesson without laughter. Talking about her grading style, try not to play any tricks in your assignments since Anna sticks to the marking scheme strictly. Whatever people comment Anna, get yourself into the class and participate as actively as you can and you will find the bright side of Anna. She is very friendly anyway!",

Don't worry if your tasks are not finished perfectly. I got mostly 4s and 5s for my assignments and I even got a 3 for my ELPA Reading (4356666666) but I still have an A-.

The style is quite similar despite the sequence of the 2 components (Individual + Group) but, before the assessment, you have to spend at least one whole day to go through ALL the recommended topics and 2 lengthy while boring video clips and the way you speak in HKDSE never works in this assessment.",

You shouldnt expect to learn much, except a bit of the academic discussion skills.<br />Just like Lang1002A, this course requires you attention through out the lessons and opportunities to practice your verbal english.<br /><br />You should take note of the vocab test also. It is not easy to learn the usage of all 120 word overnight (for me it's 10 or 20 words)<br /><br />Anyways, you are required to take the course and you cant drop it, so suck it up lol",

Writing Assessment (Topic is decided by yourself, as long as it is related to beauty will be fine) - 20%<br />2. Vocabulary Test (Similar to Lang1002, there are three word lists, with 120 words in total. Format same as Lang1002; but no VOLT is needed) -15%<br />3. Speaking Assessment (two parts: first part is a 2-min pitch to suggest a way promote happiness, second part is 8-min group discussion) -20%<br />4. ELPA -40%<br />5.

Which makes the boring topic of beauty and happiness much more interesting. Every time he teaches us a new words, we went off topic and discuss about the cultures that related to the word taught. It was quite fun watching him chatting with the internationals tbh lol. <br /><br />He will also search for materials outside the book (animation/youtube video) to make the lessons less boring.<br /><br />He might give u some worksheets after watching certain videos/paragraphs. U have to do that and hand it to him and he will actually mark them for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;(they are not mandatory tho. U can choose not to do them and he wont be angry)<br /><br />Whenever i send him email to ask him questions or advices. He always print out what i wrote and mark them, giving me suggestions on grammar and content and that really helps.<br /><br />He is also very considerate. I was preparing my vocab quiz and forgot to do the homework. I told him that i was too focused on my quiz and he just replied &quot; thats ok &quot; with a big smile.<br /><br />But it seems that he doesnt like people being late.<br /><br /><br />The only thing to complain is that some of the instructions is not clear. We sometimes ended up dont know what to do when we return home. (Maybe it is just my problem)<br /><br />All in all, he is a passionate and a very very nice instructor.",

After which, she will ask some questions regarding the topic. <br />Sometimes (a few lessons), she took us to computer room to do VOLT exercises. You can do your own things after completing the exercise. <br />If you wanted to hea, she was good for you. Because she was quite hea also. <br />But if you wanted to learn something or improve your English, she is definitely not for you.",
            "comment_teaching": "She taught little things. She simply used the LANG 1003 textbook to teach. So textbook is a must. Her teaching was like everyone could be the lecturer. Just followed what the textbook said. <br />Most importantly, for the assignments, she gave little guidelines to us. We didn't know how she marked our assignments. We didn't know what is good and what is bad. It was quite frustrating for us to complete the assignment without a clear guidelines.",
            "comment_grading": "There was no guidelines for the assignments. She said almost nothing about that. For the written assignment, she only circled a few (around three mistakes) on my writing and gave me a straight Five. One of the &quot;mistakes&quot; is not mistake. I am pretty sure the grammar is correct, after looking it up online. Apart from that, she didn't say any other things about my writing and gave me straight 5.<br />Finally, my ELPA results and assignments are mostly 5, with a few 6. It turned out to be an A-.",

Do note that I am judging this section based on content alone, not the tutor. The tutor that I received was fantastic and she tried to make the content as interesting as possible. However, with this form of mundane topics, you can't really do much.",
            "comment_teaching": "I personally really enjoyed Joyce's lessons. She's that kind of instructor that you either love or hate. Very dedicated to her work and loves listening to other people's opinion. I guess the atmosphere of the class matters as well as my class was really talkative and we interacted a lot. <br /><br />What I appreciate most about her was that she would take the initiative to send a follow-up email summarising what you have missed if you chose to skip the class (as you all know we can skip about ~5 classes, so I optimized that opportunity). She would also take the initiative to give more external activities, which is not compulsory of course, but she tried and I appreciate the effort.",

            "comment_workload": "I think it is fair for a 3-credit course. Most of my time taken is based on learning the vocabulary as it is really not as simple as it sounds, you must learn how to apply these vocabs and their abbreviations. <br /><br />I also spent a lot of time writing the essay as I chose a fairly uncommon topic concerning beauty, but the hard work paid off and Joyce managed to guide me through the entire process really well.",
