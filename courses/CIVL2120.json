Unless, you have studied CIVL2110 early (in year 1 spring) and got a grade that you satisfied with it. <br /><br />Only 15 students study in this semester (However, two of them failed since they didn't show up in final exam)<br /><br />Ch. 1: Introduction<br />Ch. 2: Stress and Strain; Axial Loading <br />Ch. 3: Torsion <br />Quiz 1: (Chp 1-3, skipped power of torsional shaft) (Very difficult)<br />------------------------------<br />Ch. 4: Pure Bending + Review of Statics: Beam analysis (singularity functions will be introduced)<br />Ch. 5: Analysis and Design of Beams for Bending (**Most important in Quiz 2, especially the singularity function!!!!)<br />Quiz 2: (Ch. 4-5: RC beam &amp; Shear/Moment Diagram w or w/o self weight and its design criteria (what is the minimum &amp; economical S? Check table!)) (Very easy!)<br />------------------------------<br />Ch. 6: Shearing Stresses in Beams<br />Ch. 7: Transformation of Stress and Strain (only learn the equations for principal stresses, and its angles; mention Mohr's circle but not in exam; only test in MC)<br />Ch. 9: Deflection of Beams (Only learn statically determinate beam; skipped indeterminate, moment area theorem, method of superposition) (**Most important, especially the singularity function and plotting graph!!!!)<br />Final: (Ch. 1-7, 9; mainly focused in Ch. 2, 5, 7, 9) (Quite difficult in my opinion)<br /><br />P.S. Some questions in quiz 2 &amp; final exam MUST use CAS calculator.",
            "comment_teaching": "For tutorial: I only attended two or three tutorials, and I heard from my friend who also studied with me said one of the tutors finished the tutorial in 15 minutes and then leave XP<br />While I think the first tutor (from 清華大學, she studied under a strict system, hence she corrected paper very strictly (as you can see in the 1st quiz...))<br /><br />For Dr Hu's teaching, I think it is good and easygoing. He taught us both traditional approach (as Tim Tse did in Spring), and the &quot;efficient&quot; approach (using CAS Calculator). He exchanged the lecture and tutorial time (originally 9am for lecture). <br /><br />Some lectures In CIVL barn, because of the easier access to Ti-CAS software, instead of using the handheld. Some students talked to him after each lecture, and I was not sure what they were talking about...Maybe about the lecture slides?<br /><br />Calculators are loaned to us, so we don't need to buy one.",
            "comment_grading": "Only 2-3 out of 15 students are given A range, i.e. follow the UST grading scheme.<br /><br />P.S. As most of you reading this review WILL NOT normally take this course in fall semester (unless you follow the accelerated course pattern), I will just briefly write down the approximating mark for the mean.<br /><br />Quiz 1 (15%): 38/100 (Mean: ~28, SD:~very high) <br />Quiz 2 (15%): 100/100 (Mean: ~74, SD: normal)<br />Final (60%): Unknown/100 (Mean &amp; SD unknown, since he released the grade before showing the final mark)<br />Participation (10%): Unknown/10 (Who knows...)<br />Grade: B+",

Hence, we skipped one chapter and brief taught in some chapters.",

So you can just copy from the solutions but be aware that there can be many mistakes in the solutions. So, think when you are copying. Don't just blindly copy. <br /><br />Midterm exam was very similar to assignment / tutorial problems in terms of the difficulty. Therefore, make sure you will not make any careless mistakes in calculations. There were a total of 3 questions and each contained 3 to 4 sub-questions. <br /><br />As for the final exam, there were a total of 4 questions and the last sub-question in each question was told to be challenging (and it was in fact). We may not have seen these questions in tutorial classes or homework.",
            "comment_teaching": "Lecture videos were recorded but released some days before midterm/final exam so you had better attend the lessons. <br /><br />Another reason for attending lessons is that the lecturer may add something onto the lecture slides but they would not be updated. <br /><br />Only during the midterm/final exam period would fewer students attend lectures.",

No paper checking session was held. He replied a request for paper checking that the marking scheme was set by him and thus there should be no problems.<br /><br />As for the assignments, most of the students got 9X or 100.<br /><br />In the final exam, note that there were some problems on concepts instead of merely calculations, unlike the midterm exam.<br /><br />I skipped almost all last sub-question in each question given that I cannot get all correct for other sub-questions. It seems this is the reason why I cannot get an A+.",
