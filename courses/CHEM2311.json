            "comment_content": "An introductory course for non-chemistry major students, including BCB, BIOT, ENVS, CENG, CBME, etc. Very diverse backgrounds. This somehow shows that analytical chemistry can be widely applied to lots of areas.<br /><br />Some parts of the content in this course overlap with those of CHEM1030, so it is suggested you have taken CHEM1030 before registering this course even though it is not listed as a prerequisite. Basic statistics background (MATH2411/ISOM2500/SOSC1100) is also highly recommended if you wanna better understand the concept of the confidence interval (including the distribution of sample means, the Central Limit Theorem, and how you devise the sampling plan) and the rationale behind these statistical tests (Type-I/II errors in hypothesis testing and the rejection rules).<br /><br />But don't worry if you don't have any statistics background. The statistics taught in this course is basically a series of standard procedures and you can skim through the part even though you don't understand the details behind.<br /><br />Before midterm<br />🔷 1 Introduction to Analytical Chemistry<br />🔶 2 Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry<br />🔶 3 Errors and Uncertainty<br />🔶 4 Statistics<br />🔶 5 Standardization<br />🔶 6 Sampling<br />🔷 7 Gravimetry<br />🔶🔷 8 Titration<br /><br />After midterm<br />🔶🔷 10 Spectroscopy<br />🔷 11 Chromatography<br />🔷 12 Mass Spectrometry<br />🔶🔷 13 Electrochemistry<br /><br />🔶 Calculation-based<br />🔷 Principle-based<br /><br />Chapters 1 to 6 are mostly numerical methods for experimental design and data analysis, and from chapter 7 onwards they are analytical methods commonly used. Most of the parts are in fact quite conceptually demanding and needs some time to digest. Note that understanding of concepts is more important than calculation. You've probably seen similar stuff of acid-base titration and electrochemistry in CHEM1030 previously, but new things in the more applied aspect, such as EDTA titration, amperometry, potentiometry and cyclic voltammetry, are also introduced.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Yan He is indeed a very passionate lecturer. He came back to UST for teaching after his own start-up failed. With such an experience, he is unlike many other professors who only stay in the ivory tower for the whole life. He is also dedicated to improving our presentation skills, and he let students volunteer for a presentation on any topic they like in front of the whole class. But at last only 1 student did it. :(<br /><br />His teaching is generally good in science school's standard. But I really think some parts of it could be improved. In the beginning he spent slightly too much time explaining the easy part of significant figures, and then rushed a bit too fast in the more difficult statistics part, which I believe most students don't have any background at all. But the good thing is that he used iPRS to test our knowledge in class and assigned homework to let us have more practice (though he obviously doesn't know how to use the iPRS system lol). These are quite effective in helping us understand the concept and how we'll possibly make mistakes in the exams.",
            "comment_grading": "✏️ Assignments x 2: 10%<br />✏️ Mid-term: 45%<br />✏️ Non-cumulative final exam: 45%<br /><br />Exams consist of MCQs, calculation problems and short questions.<br /><br />Midterm:<br />Mean = 70. SD = 16.<br />A lot of calculation problems. Generally not difficult as soon as you have understood the content enough, had enough practice and done the paper CAREFULLY. Pay special attention to acid-base equilibria calculation and EDTA titration which are the most difficult parts of the midterm. Calculation of propagation of uncertainty is tedious, but if you're careful then you'll be fine. A few principle-based questions are also asked, e.g.<br /><br />🔷 What are the 2 reasons why Mg is commonly used in EDTA titration?<br />🔷 Does a more acidic environment favor the liquid-liquid extraction?<br /><br />Final:<br />Mean = 69.7. SD unknown.<br />More difficult as it required us to explain in detail the principles of these analytical methods in our own words. When marking our papers the TA's have a habit of randomly deducting 1 or 2 marks from each question... Just try your best to score partial credits for each question.<br /><br />A few examples:<br />🔷 Explain the difference between atomic absorption and emission spectroscopy. Why is the inductively coupled plasma the most suitable atomization method for atomic emission spectroscopy?<br />🔷 Why does atomic emission give clear and discrete spectral lines while molecular emission gives a spectrum with continuous wavelengths?<br />🔷 Why is the bandwidth of the emission spectrum broader than that of the hollow-cathode lamp emission?<br />🔷 Explain how column chromatography works, including the roles of stationary phase and mobile phase.<br />🔷 What are the 3 pieces of information we can obtain from the mass-spectrometry spectrum, other than the mass of the molecule?<br />🔷 Explain how the 3-electrode design of the glucose meter can eliminate the effect of interfering biological species during the detection of blood glucose level.<br /><br />You either understand the whole thing or flunk the whole final exam.<br /><br />You've still got 2 to 3 calculation problems in the final though, mostly involving:<br />🔶 Beer's law<br />🔶 Nernst equation<br />🔶 Boltzmann distribution formula for fraction of electrons in excited states<br /><br />I got 96/100 (+1.6 SD) in the midterm and 86.5/100 in the final.<br />💯 Final grade: A+<br /><br />Better than expected.

And it is indeed highly recommended you attend his lectures because he will lay emphasis on important concepts, and you'll know the parts of the ppts you really need to study. Otherwise, you may end up revising a lot of unimportant and messy details that are distracting and not required at all.<br /><br />The 2 assignments before the midterm is a little bit of workload, but we do need them to practice the calculation. No more assignments will be distributed after the midterm as the content becomes more principle-based. Btw assignments are credited upon submission, i.e. you can submit any crap to get full score.",

Standardizing Analytical Methods<br />5. Collecting and Preparing Samples<br />6.

Spectroscopic method: (Overview and Absorption Spectroscopy)<br />10. Spectroscopic method: (Atomic Emission and Absorption Spectrometry)<br />11. Chromatography<br />12. Mass Spectrometry<br />13. Electrolysis and Electrochemistry-based analysis<br /><br />The midterm exam covers Ch 1-9, while the final exam would cover Ch 10-13 as well as analytical methods in all chapters.<br /><br />This course introduces the basic information of analytical chemistry, from mathematical knowledge like statistics, standardization calibration curves, to chemical knowledge like titration, spectrometry and electrochemistry. Students who attend the course are advised to have a solid background in statistics and chemistry.<br /><br />Undergraduates who attend the class can have a slight advantage in making use of instrumental analysis. For example, students can acknowledge that spectrometry can detect groups of metal ions in heavy water. Having a solid understanding, they can analyse the samples at ease.<br /><br />However, the materials in this course are a little bit underwhelming.

Luckily, he listened to the students and did not proceed with making us do the presentations. <br />I think maybe he should contact the school to send a mass email if he wants to make the competition more successful, not talk for the majority of the lecture about it in a course that people are taking just to satisfy some course requirements.",

I was expecting F so it is satisfactory for me. <br />Just one annoying thing is the attendance system, he picks names at random to check at end of lectures but its annoying to get picked all the time even though the people who dont actually come never get picked.

He engages the students with the topics using personal experiences and also real world examples.

He is also very approachable and responds quickly to emails on canvas. The professor even gave a list of formulae to memorize and things to remember for the exams.<br />There are lecture videos available too if you want and I gotta say they were extremely helpful right before exams to revise if you had not showed up for class once or twice.",

            "comment_content": "This course is like the starting step to further courses like instrumental analysis or other analytical techniques courses. It is made intentionally for non-chemistry major students. <br /><br />I have to say this course really provides a lot of great info and skills to anyone doing research (even in biochemistry); the professor has chosen topics and experimental techniques that are very accessible and overall the course flows very well (even though some people complained it was math heavy, but the math parts were actually useful even for other majors, especially stats) The chapters covered were:<br /><br />1. Basic tools - e.g. using s.f. and decimal places, analyzing results <br />2. Uncertainty and propagation. <br />3. Statistics (T-tests, F-test, Grubb's test ...) <br />4. Standardization (single, multi-point, standard addition and internal standard) <br />5. Sampling and statistics <br />6. Gravimetry (Gravitational analysis, TGA and elemental analysis) <br />7. Titration (Acid base and EDTA) <br />[MID TERMS] <br /><br />8. Spectroscopy (UV-Vis, Abs and Transmittance, atomic absorption and emission)<br />9. Chromatography (LC, GC, HPLC) <br />10. Mass Spectrometry (5-6 types) <br />11. Electrochemistry and its applications (e.g. pH meter, glucose meter, band gap...) <br />[FINALS] <br /><br />Overall, the content was mainly about how to collect and process data for conclusions, and the experimental approaches and analysis for very specific measurements ... something like that. It does flow very well from IB Chemistry, but do expect that you have to do calculations in every chapter. <br /><br />Although the finals is non-cumulative, you may need to recongize some techniques from pre-midterm (but only 1-2). DO NOT READ THE TEXTBOOK (he even suggested against using the textbook), as long as you watch the lecture videos or attend class that is more than good enough.",
            "comment_teaching": "He is a very enthusiastic professor, he knows and can make people understand his content very easily. Although he is from the mainland, he has worked in many industries in the US and his English is very good (Slight American accent lol). <br /><br />Sometimes he deviates from the content a little bit (still related) to talk a bit about his research or previous experiences in labs/industries, or the news; students actually find it quite interesting, especially when he makes it funny! <br /><br />Other benefits of his teaching:<br />- He has iPRS questions during class - guess what, these ended up being the exam questions (aka 40% of mid term MCQs were already given in class lol) <br />- To be honest he indirectly answers every exam question in the paper (especially the finals, all the essay writing was directly wait he said in class). <br />- He uses a projector to show his math working/drawings (a lot of these calculations are exactly what will show up in the exams) <br />- Relates a lot of his content to real cases, so it makes the content a lot more meaningful. <br /><br />Flaws? <br />Only one, he has too many slides! a lot are just there 'for information' and he doesn't spend time on it (not asked in the exam). Just look at the slides which he spends time on for exams - I feel like he is doing this so only students who attend class/ watch lecture videos knows what to study",

This 9% is only based on if you submitted, not how correct you are. For the second hw he even put out model answers before the deadline (ikr, really strange? we could just copy??) <br /><br />1% Attendance - He will take attendance in class sometimes (via iPRS). <br /><br />Issue with this course is that people do well - homework and attendance is full for almost everyone, mid-term and final average was higher than 70%. <br /><br />Overall mid-term had easier questions (because more topics were covered), while finals had harder and in-depth questions on less topics. <br /><br />My Grades:<br />100% (10/10) for hw and attendance - easy part<br />100% for mid-term <br />88% for finals<br />Overall score: 94%, Grade: A+ <br />P.S.
