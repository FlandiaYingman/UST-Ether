As most of my classmates have learnt Chinese dance before, the difficulty and standard would then become higher which may become hard to some beginners. <br />For theory part, students only need to jot down the notes and reflection in each lesson and submit a journal at the end of the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Tutor is patient to teach each students and would give some advices. She aims to let students enjoy to experience the Chinese dance and thus focuses more on this part. She would briefly talk about the theory part at the end of each lesson in a relax way.",
