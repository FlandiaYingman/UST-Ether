        "description": "Modern civil infrastructure systems are planned and operated under significant uncertainties. To make the best decisions, we have to take account of these uncertainties and anticipate how the eventual outcome depends on future random events. This course is designed to provide theoretical and practical experiences in stochastic programming with a special focus on applications in Civil Engineering. Stochastic programming is concerned with the optimal decision making in the presence of uncertainty. On the theoretical side, topics include modeling uncertainty in optimization problems, algorithms for stochastic programming, and approximation and sampling methods. On the application side, we will primarily focus on practical examples in the area of transportation and energy. Through lectures, assignments and projects, students will learn state-of-the-art models and tools to identify, formulate, and address emerging challenges in the planning and operating of modern civil infrastructure systems.",
