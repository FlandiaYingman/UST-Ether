        "description": "This course will help students appreciate the power of the sociological imagination in understanding their everyday lives. This is an age in which we tend to explain human behavior in terms of our individual achievements, personalities, and even our genetic make-up. The sociologist, however, looks at human behavior as the product of groups, organizations and culture. In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods. These topics will include: culture, deviance, inequality, religion, education, social change and development, gender, intimate relations and the family, and power and politics.",

In the lectures, she was just kind of reading aloud the word file in front of the slides. <br /><br />She was not managing the time allocation well too, like why spending time discussing so many stuffs beyond the lecture contents. I mean, it is really ok and thought-provoking for a lecture, but it should not be too long and too far beyond the syllabus.<br /><br />I tried to attend the lectures but later I gave up. Read the notes would do. Create examples for your own convenience would do. Anything would do but attending lectures.<br /><br />Disclaimer 1: just opinion given according to my preferences and learning style. It may not suit you. I advise you to try attending the lectures in the first few weeks after all.<br /><br />Disclaimer 2: Note to non-local students - prof would play videos of local TV programme archives and use local examples to explain the social issues.

This ability applies more significantly to the content after Mid-Term Examination.",
