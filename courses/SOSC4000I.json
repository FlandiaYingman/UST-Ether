        "description": "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a political and economic mobilization that has become the most important aspect of China's presence abroad. While mainly involving thousands of investment and infrastructure projects in developing countries, the BRI has other aspects, including some that are geo-strategic. For that reason, the US has mounted an anti-BRI counter-mobilization that enlists allies, such as India and Japan, to attack the BRI as \"Chinese neo-colonialism,\" a \"Chinese debt trap,\" etc. The global controversy about the BRI has largely been uniformed by academic analysis, but after several years of practice, it is now possible to analyze it dimensions, significance and outcomes. This seminar will focus on discussing global and country case analyses of the BRI. Teams of students will also research and write a short paper on an aspect of the BRI of their own choice.",

            "comment_teaching": "For lectures by the professor, he basically just read out the stuff on the powerpoint, but if you ask him questions he would answer you in great detail<br />Guest lectures were generally boring but some did provide some inspiring insights<br />For much part of the course it was student-led seminars",
            "comment_grading": "The syllabus says that &quot;in a 4000/5000-level seminar course, such as this one, students tend to be self-selected for interest in the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;They therefore generally perform well and grades for both UG and PG students tend to be much higher than they are for lower level courses&quot;.<br />But then the grading was not very transparent. Except for the marks of the final exam, no other things were disclosed.<br /><br />But it was not bad though. I got a bit below mean in the final exam and participated quite a lot in classes. I had no idea if my paper is good or not. Turns out I got a B+. So quite good I think.",
            "comment_workload": "40% Research paper (12-15 pages for UG and 15-20 for PG)<br />30% Final exam (30 MCs in an hour)<br />20% Class participation (just talk at least once every lecture and the TA would mark your name down)<br />10% Discussion leadership (performance in the seminar that you lead)<br /><br />And quite some reading to do so that you can be prepared for participation in class<br /><br />Originally you were required to present your research paper to the class but then it was cancelled due to the social movement (GFHKSDGM)",
