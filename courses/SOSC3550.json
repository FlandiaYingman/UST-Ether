Topics covered include cognitive, language, and literacy development; social, moral, and emotional development; effective teaching and learning strategies; individual differences in learning; assessment of learning; and educational issues currently relevant in the Hong Kong society. This course is appropriate for those who are interested in a career in teaching, but also for those who are interested in understanding how development occurs across the lifespan and becoming more efficient learners, both inside and outside of the classroom.",

Some questions are detailed, try to really understand all the experiments and pay attention to the in-class videos. Since it was a mixed-mode course, it might differ from the structure for the coming f2f semester.<br />Designing an 80minute course project might be the only work, but it is really fun to come up with a whole new lesson with the rationale back up by the course materials by yourself.",
