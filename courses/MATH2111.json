I fell asleep in one (maybe more) of the lessons. I think I slept for ~45 mins, but I can easily catch up with the progress just by reading her notes and listening to her again.

Practice more on past paper, and do more problems and you would be fine.<br /><br />The final consists of only MC problems. Some of the questions are quite difficult. You need to be familiar with the concepts to get them correct. The annoying thing is there would be a 'none of the others' options so you will be doubtful whether your calculation is correct. Oppose to the midterm, the focus is on the concepts (especially on vector spaces). I believe you don't have to spend much time preparing but I do recommend you to watch this 3b1b series to have a visual understanding (instead of blindly remembering definitions).<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab",

Most of these are wordy, and at the end of the course, you still don't know their actual fucking use (the notes and the textbook just gave some brief explanation, or gave none at all).<br /><br />Not to mention that you won't be able to do actual linear algebra proofs after taking this course. (Well, the proofs in exams are literally just another way of asking you to do computation.)<br /><br />But isn't it good? Computation is easier than proofs afterall! Weeeeell... The problem is, what are needed to compute are just row reduction, matrix algebra and determinant (with dot product later)... The course reduces to doing these 3-4 things repeatedly throughout the 3-month period, which makes it very boring and unworthy of time.<br /><br />Deemphasizing proofs like in MATH 2011 is acceptable, but more concepts should have been introduced and more explanation should have been given!",

So I guess the actual paper was written by Mr. Li. The style really differs a lot.

As one can see, large amount of contents before the midterm are introduced in high-school-level M2. Students who've studied M2 also have the advantage on doing Gaussian elimination more quickly due to previous exercises.<br /><br />The topic of diagonalization is also implicitly involved in your M2 curriculum. Think about of that type of long question where you were required to find the 100th or 2020th square of a certain matrix----that's part of the typical diagonalization problem, with the diagonalized matrix directly given to you.<br /><br />In general, I find that MATH2111 one of the easiest MATH courses throughout your engineering program.",
            "comment_teaching": "This year's lecturer is Dr. Ho. As I've reviewed his teaching style when I reviewed MATH2011, I'll leave the link to my previous review:<br /><br />https://ust.space/review/MATH2011/view/z8z9U1U6UccMOSuXsJ5NELMI1YhiM8vd<br /><br />This semester's TA is Tommy Cheng, who spoke a moderate Hong Kong accent. That said, his teaching was generally clear (if not a few careless mistakes), and he do provide us with ample after-class questions and true/false concept questions for us to revise. Extra questions were provided before the final exam, which is a plus for calculation-intensive courses.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading scheme is similar to MATH2011:<br />9 assignments: 10% (All full marks)<br />2 presentations: 10% (All full marks)<br />Midterm: 30% (19/33, Mean: 18.34/33, SD 5.3)<br />Final: 50% (42/50, Mean: 29.45/45)<br /><br />When compared with last year's MATH2011, the assignments and presentations are generally easy and straightforward, and the midterm and final questions are also the as well: there are neither complicated nor tricky questions.<br /><br />Moreover, this year's midterm contains 1 long question lasted for 15 minutes, and the final have 2 for 15 and 10 minutes. Both are strikingly easy, but the limited time means any hesitation may lead you to 0 mark in the long questions. You should therefore ensure yourself familiar with all theorems. All other questions in the midterm and finals are MC questions.<br /><br />For those who regularly skip courses, you are also advised to review course videos (well, if next semester still provide them). One long question during the midtetrm asked you about visualizing the concept of one-to-one and onto as taught on the lectures.<br /><br />At the end, thanks to the improved final result, I get an A for this course, which is my first and last A range grade in a MATH course. This shows that with more practice before exams, it's not really hard to attain a A range or even A+ for MATH2111.",
            "comment_workload": "The 9 assignments are similar to your typical MATH assignments, but this time some questions, especially conceptual T/F questions have limited attempts. It can be therefore observed that a number of students slumped thanks to this mechanism, as seen from the mean of some assignments that go as low as 74.89/100. All in all, if you have doubts when doing assignments, consider going to the Math Support Center for help.<br /><br />Presentations are also easy and straightforward, something similar to last year's MATH2011. Perhaps due to anti-cheating during online semester, Professor Ho implements some additional requirements regarding our presentations. Follow all instructions (like some descriptions must be written on real paper) and you should get an easy full mark.<br /><br />So similar to other MATH courses, the main workload comes from preparing the midterms and finals. Do past papers help, and the exam's difficulty should be also on par with the past papers.",

To be honest I would rather learn the operation before learning the concept and logic behind.

            "comment_teaching": "今年因為Online Semester嘅原因，所以Prof改用左第一次以Geogebra Class黎上堂，會多啲用Geometry形式黎教大家（佢話係比3B1B嘅Linear Algebra Series啟發，個人都覺得用Geometry學會好好多，但書都寫得唔錯），但佢就第一堂講野比較慢，我之後都走哂堂。<br />TA就應該教得唔錯嘅，我上一左堂就無上，但Tutorial Notes啲題目嘅答法都寫得幾好，值得一睇。<br /><br />推薦各位學每個Concept之前睇左3B1B嘅Essence of Linear Algebra先，另外有個TheTrevTutor都講得OK",
            "comment_grading": "今個Sem因為係Online Sem，所以直接開放所有Online Calculator同Wolframe Alpha，變相就係題目會考得深啲同埋少純計算，多左Proof嘅題目，而且每一題時間都係得20min做，非常短，一旦諗錯方向就GG，好似我就係前面啲送分題出左事，就無左一半分。<br /><br />由於可能係第一個Sem咁樣教同埋出呢種題型嘅卷啦，所以比Grade都比得鬆手好多，我見有人踩Mean都有B，非常好Grade。<br /><br />Me<br />25% HW: full<br />75% Exam : 56/72 (mean : 33.2, SD: 15.3)<br /><br />高mean大約1.5SD，最後A，應該差好少有A+，但都算係咁。",
            "comment_workload": "成個course我係後尾睇書自學嘅，大約兩個禮拜左右就學完，書入面嘅內容比較多係唔關呢個course事嘅，但睇哂之後會融會貫通，好建議睇埋啲Proof去了解多啲每樣野點黎。有時間要做下書後面嘅題目，單數題目已經非常夠做，我因為時間唔多所以無乜做到。<br /><br />功課如果有上堂同Tutorial就好快做完，得四份功課。",

Orthogonality<br /><br />The content before midterm comprises of the first 3 topics, which is quite easy to handle for students who have taken M2 in HKDSE. However, the content goes more difficult after the midterm, because some concepts about vector space are quite abstract, and those questions often require rigorous proves. <br />Since the lecture time is not enough, some topics in orthogonality are not included, such as orthogonal projection, properties about orthogonal matrix, best approximation theorem and the Gram-Schmidt Process.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching of Dr. Ho is awesome. He explain the concepts clearly and I can feel his passion for teaching. He will upload videos of every lecture on canvas and distribute colorful lecture notes on class. The only drawback is that he is not willing to upload his notes on canvas, so you have to attend every lesson in order to get his notes.<br /><br />However, I think the TA is not quite good. He does not prepare the tutorials well, as he sometimes made careless mistakes in calculations, which wastes a lot of time. Also, he uploaded the answers of tutorial notes lately, sometimes ever a week late, which hinders my progress of revision.",

However, the mean score especially the final exam is lower than my expectation.",

            "comment_content": "The contents are mainly focused on linear algebra. It consists of 7 chapters:<br />1. Systems of Linear Equations<br />2. Matrix Algebra<br />3. Determinants<br />4. Vector Spaces<br />5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors<br />6. Inner Product Spaces<br />7. Symmetric Matrices and Quadratic Forms<br /><br />In details, there are contents with some difficulty to understand:<br />a. Vector Subspaces (Chapter 4)<br />b. Basis (Chapter 4)<br />c. Row Spaces, Column Spaces and Null Spaces (Chapter 4)<br />d. Matrix Diagonalization (Chapter 5)<br />e. Dynamical System and Differential Equation (Chapter 5)<br />f. Normalization to Orthonormal Basis with G.S. Method (Chapter 6)<br /><br />Note that although the course has taught dynamical systems and differential equations, it almost never appeared in the final exams (including the past papers).<br /><br />This makes sense since they require much more computation than the rest of the topics, and most questions even involve decimal places (even the exercises on Classviva is so!), which would be difficult to compute, considering that the exams do not allow calculators.",

The accent is acceptable but still not very good.<br />However, since the exams are more focused on the concepts in this semester, heavily relying on her notes is not enough.<br /><br />Prof. Yin is also on the instructor list since he substituted Prof. Ye for weeks due to Ye got a sick leave for several weeks. I think there is not much to say about him, considering the madness of lambol and jello.<br /><br />Because of this, it is more important for you to self-study.<br /><br />(I cannot give any comments about the tutorials, since I skipped almost all of them lmao)",

This is probably why the mean would be lower than the previous semesters.<br />Midterm: 75/100 (mean: 55.1)<br />Final part 1: 13/20 (mean: 11.3)<br />Final part 2: 17/20 (mean: 13.1)<br /><br />Final grade: A- (77.5%)<br /><br />The grading is pretty much fine.

            "comment_content": "Doesn't teach half the content that is supposed to be in an introductory linear algebra class. Only teaches the most basic matrix computation and concepts. I don't understand why the course teaches so slowly and repeats the same content over and over again.<br /><br />Honestly I would suggest watching Strang's videos on YouTube from MIT OCW instead. It teaches much better and covers more depth and contents that are necessary/helpful for your future studies. (Complex Matrices, Fast Fourier Transforms, Pseudoinverses etc.)<br /><br />Also, if you can't stand the pace either, just binge Strang's videos 3/4 days before your exams and you'll be fine.",
