The tutorials are meant to help you install Qiskit plus Q&amp;A for any questions you might have regarding the program. We also had a guest lecturer who covered two of the lectures on Qiskit.<br /><br />The course content are as follows:<br /><br />1) Quantum Computation I<br />2) Quantum Computation II<br />3) Entanglement I<br />4) Entanglement II<br />5) Quantum technology I<br />6) (Guest) Qiskit I<br />7) Quantum technology II<br />8) (Guest) Qiskit II",

            "comment_grading": "We only had one Term paper worth 100% due at the end of the semester. Prof also gave out an additional Qiskit assignment which could count for up to 20% bonus. <br /><br />Term paper details:<br />- Roughly 800 words (excluding reference)<br />- Covering anything relevant related to Quantum Information/Computing (or smth from the lectures)<br />- Intended for general scientists<br />- Evaluated on:<br /> 1) Academic correctness ( 30 pts)<br /> 2) Complete literature review (30 pts)<br /> 3) Citations (10 pts)<br /> 4) Creative writing (10pts)<br /> 5) Scientific writing (20 pts)<br /><br />Any accounts of plagiarism will result in an F grade.<br /><br />At the beginning of the course, Prof. Jo said he'll give everyone an A range as long we hand in proper writing. I got A-&nbsp;&nbsp;for scoring 88/100 on my term paper (the mean was 89) and I didn't do the bonus homework.",
            "comment_workload": "You'll need to struggle a bit towards the end of the sem because it takes a lot of effort to cover literature review to understand the topics in-depth. Problem is, the schedule overlaps with your midterms/ finals so it might be a hassle down the road. Other than that, you can just enjoy your time during lectures.",
