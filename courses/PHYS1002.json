It is very similar to what they do in HKDSE physics, or physics 1112. Theoretically, you will be able to get the questions right even without a physics background (If you are very smart). More on that in the Grading part. <br /><br />=Content=<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust me, they are not as interesting as they sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The course started with plenty of memorization of not-so interesting concepts. Those includes the concept of light-year, look-back time etc, which are essentially complex ways of describing really far objects. And then we moved on to talking about the phases of the moon and the formation of seasons, which is all about imagining how a big sphere (also known as the Moon) rotates around a even bigger sphere (also known as the Earth). If you are good at imagination, you are gonna have a good time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Mid-term we moved onto more interesting topics like supernovas and black holes. But then the professor decided to rush the topics which made these interesting topics not so interesting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, which more interesting topics came more complex calculations. At some point, a Greek astronomer Hipparchus decided that measuring distance is idiotic and decided to implement a more idiotic way of measuring distance, known as &quot;apparent magnitude&quot; and &quot;the M&amp;M equation&quot;. If you are not super good at Physics, you are going to have a very bad time in dealing with those. <br /><br />=Textbook= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy the textbook. I didn't buy the textbook. I strongly recommend buying the textbook. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The lecture notes are in point form and contain mistakes here and there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some lecture slides don't even have words. Using the lecture notes alone will NOT help you to understand the concept. The textbook provides more in depth explaining, plus some exercises for you to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S: Nevertheless, The lecture PowerPoint covers everything there is in the exam. Using the PPTs are adequate for you to answer all of the questions in the Exam. If you don't really care about what you are learning (Like me), then you don't have to buy the textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;P.P.S: I was almost the only girl in the whole class. Please don't reg this course if you can't stand boy-only environment)",
            "comment_teaching": "=CHEN Tian Wen= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't really comment about his look. Through the Zoom video I could't see much other than his forehead and his hair. (He does have pretty good hair).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He did tried his best to make in-class interactions (In the first few lessons at least). After while he probably realized that no one really pays attention in Zoom-lectures and gave up entirely. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be a pretty nice guy and I'm sure that he's willing to answer your question if you have any. But he did a really bad job explaining concepts. (Probably something to do with his flat tones making it hard to focus). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes attendance through iPRS in class, which will take up 5% of your exam grade. The iPRS questions are really EASY! You will be able to get them right if you have paid any attention in class. (btw I got half of them wrong)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;His English is alright. <br /><br />=Michael Altman= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Some point in the semester I got fed up with Chen Tian Wen's teaching style and I decided to sit in Altman's lesson. He doesn't seem to be that much different from Chen. Gave up after 1 lesson, went back to Chen's class.",
            "comment_grading": "=Midterm= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Midterm is scary. Midterm is split into two parts, the MC (In total 20) and the Long Questions (In total 2)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps because of the online Exam mode this semester, the Exam got really difficult and calculation involved. Almost all questions requires some level of comprehension and calculations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The past paper released before hand are really easy. So I was kinda caught off-guard in the actual mid-term. I didn't have enough time to finish the last questions. I also didn't make my own notes for the midterm, so I wasted most time frantically going through the lecture notes. Bad idea. <br /><br />=Finals= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The format and difficulties of the final exam are very similar to the mid-term. (Also three times longer). Some people say it's harder than the mid-term but I don't really think so. The last part of the Final, very much like the last part of the MT, contains very complex questions with a relatively short time limit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I was much better prepared for the finals. I've made my own notes and formula sheet, so I was able to answer the questions very quickly. But still, I find a lot of the calculation questions difficult. For the last part (calculation questions), I only finished half because 1) I don't know how to do the rest and 2) I don't have time to do the rest. <br /><br />=iPRS=<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That 5% is not worth waking up 9AM everyday. <br /><br />Grades: <br />Midterm: 70.5/86 <br />Finals: 85/100<br />Final Grade: A+ <br />Good Enough. <br />Statistics Attached for your reference. (For reference: DSE PHY 5*, No astronomy component)",
            "comment_workload": "=Good News=<br />No Homework. (Yay) <br /><br />=Bad News= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Exams are hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents might seem easy, with both exams being open-book. But most of the questions involve understanding and calculations, which really test your understanding and the time you've spent on the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Study the lecture notes thoroughly, if you have time, make your own notes. Don't rely on going through the notes in the actual exam. There is no way that is gonna work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My advise would be treating this subject as a serious Physics course. Study it the way your would study for PHYS1112 or MATH1014. Understand all of the equations, do as much exercise as you can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The workload will not be extremely light. But compare this to other 3-credit courses like 1014 or 1112, then you have an&nbsp;&nbsp;easy (relatively) good-grade common core.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />-Saber Athena",

This part includes simple calculation and theories only and the graphs and diagrams about motions of objects are relatively more important.<br /><br />The second part is related to the properties and evolution of stars. The characteristics and structures of the Sun is introduced first. Then the professor will explain the procedures of nuclear reactions and its relationship with star evolution. Giants, dwarfs, nebulae and blackholes will be detailedly covered. This is the main part of the exam as well.<br /><br />The third part is about the galaxy and universe. Although the concepts and theories are more intangible and complex, the professor will not go into details. Also, some of the arguments raised by cosmologists are not verified yet. Therefore, the focus will lie on the apparatus and methods of cosmological observations.<br /><br />Personally I think the overall content is very clear and detailed. It is highly beneficial for students interested in astronomy. The only drawback is that some small concepts like microwaves and X-ray are recited frequently in different topics but not very well explained.",

            "comment_content": "It is quite difficult as a common core course, especially for the students without or lack of science background. Even you have studied Physics in HKDSE does not mean you know what happened. People without the real interest in Astronomy and Aerospace should never reg this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor is passionate to teach with different ways of examples and elaborations, but he is just too boring and you will find it difficult to summarize his teaching. You will find many students fall asleep in his lessons because you will lose the focus with his voice. The ppt covers a lot but you are not easy to sort out the useful materials for your exams.",
            "comment_grading": "Prof gave a very good grade generally, but at least you need to catch up with the knowledge. If you got midterm or final score around the mean, the grade must be B-range if you do not below mean 1 SD or more in either one exam. If you are below mean 1 SD or more in both exam, you may still get a C, which is quite kind for the professor. Also, there is a rumor that the prof will give generally more A-range comparing other S&amp;T common core courses.",
            "comment_workload": "No homework or workload, only need to take PRS for every lecture. However, you have to do revision regularly, maybe once or twice a week. Otherwise you probably cannot handle the stuff well before the exam. The reading material and ppt are too many for a student to prepare and revise within a week, so you better prepare well for every week.",

You should be able to excel in the midterm if you have a good foundation in DSE Maths and Physics, even you may not have studied&nbsp;&nbsp;the astronomy elective in DSE Physics before. However, the real journey to astronomy starts after midterm. The main focus is the universe structure, eg how stars form and how stars die, and dark energy about an acceleratingly expanding universe. Since the course is only an introduction, as its name suggests, the topics are not too hard if you are willing to work hard.",

            "comment_workload": "Generally not huge workload. Since I have studied DSE Physics before, which is not a must to get good grades here, I didn't revise much for the midterm but my result is not too bad, still acceptable. And I revised the powerpoint notes several times for the final. My final result is good. I would say if you are willing to work hard, you can get good grade in the course regardless of your foundation.",
