        "description": "Buildings are energy‐intensive infrastructures in urban environment. In light of the\nInternational Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) reports, global warming must be limited to 1.5 deg. C. The course takes a non‐technical approach on how Smart Buildings can contribute to Zero Carbon emissions by 2050. Deployment of smart technologies (improving energy efficiencies, carbon mitigations and renewables) helps control buildings’ energy consumption and manage energy conservation resulting in ‘Smart’ or ‘Carbon Neutral’ buildings in the warming world. The significance in engaging governmental, business and social stakeholders will also be deliberated in the course for the successful provision of smart buildings in Hong Kong and internationally.",
