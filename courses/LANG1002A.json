One native American was in my class and guess what? He can get 7 only in language or pronunciation. YO~ <br />I got 5** in DSE writing and I was pretty confident in my final essay assessment. And you know what? She gave me freaking 555 and said i didn't put my topic sentence in the beginning of a paragraph HAHAHA. MY friend in S class with bad English did the essay on the day due still get A FKING 555. (FK MY LIFE)<br />And now I'm in a class with a super nice professor, a Canadian. Her name s Delian. i GOT three 7 one 6, and one bonus in the first essay. This killer really made me stressed out. I only got a Fking B+ at the end. So u know what to do la?",

Next term you will take LANG1003 which is an extension of this course. Do you really want to do all of this when you can get 6 easy credits by transferring?<br /><br />Well you may also learn APA citation from the library section but come on, you can just find APA citation generators online.",

LANG1002 and LANG1003 are extremely difficult to swap so even when you know the instructor is a killer you can't escape from it.<br /><br />Just take a look at grindingalways's review: So many 7s but still not A+!<br /><br />Even worse, you won't even know who is assigned to you! You can only know if a killer is assigned to you after the course has started! (See attachment LANG1002A.png)",
            "comment_workload": "[Here is the guide on credit transfer]<br />I only have a 5 in DSE English but managed to score a 7.5 in IELTS.<br />So here are the steps:<br />1. Visit https://crtran.ust.hk/exam_redirect<br />2. Check the requirements of credit transfer. Here I use IELTS for example: Grade of score needed for credit transfer is 7.0 or above (with no subscore lower than 6.5) and also the footnote declares that &quot;To be valid for credit transfer, a grade or score must have been obtained in the two<br />years before a student applied for admission to HKUST, i.e. if the student’s application is<br />dated 1st March 2019, the grade or score must have been obtained in the period 1st March 2017-1st March 2019.&quot;<br />3. Follow https://crtran.ust.hk/application_procedure but do not use the &quot;Credit Transfer System for Undergraduate Students&quot; (https://w5.ab.ust.hk/jsct/ct_stdt_appl) because you will not find public examinations like IELTS there, only university names as this system is for people who have studied in other universities before. However, you should take note of &quot;Official transcript or examination certificate&quot; and &quot;Course/subject information&quot; (LANG1002 and LANG1003).<br />4. Send an email to crtran@ust.hk and remember to attach a copy of your IELTS results.<br />5. Within a few days you should notice that your registered courses (Navigate to https://my.ust.hk/ -&gt; click &quot;Student Center&quot; -&gt; click &quot;enrollment shopping cart&quot; -&gt; scroll to the bottom) will have a dropped LANG1002 course. This is completely normal and signifies that your application is being processed.<br />6. Remember to register a Common Core course to substitute for the dropped LANG course! Most Year 1 Fall students have a 14 credit load and you will probably want to live an easier Year 2 Fall and afterwards with a lower credit load then 15. I chose PHYS1111 since I had a 5 in DSE Physics and fortunately a 2 in M2 so that I don't have to compete with NDS in MATH1013 and PHYS1112.<br />7. Within a few more days you will receive an email from crtran@ust.hk, e.g.<br /><br />Dear student,<br />You could now check your SIS system for credit transfer result. Thank you.<br />Best Regards,<br />Kayla LAM<br />Academic Registry<br /><br />8.

One of the most important skills is nominalization, which is basically the technique of converting long clauses into noun phrases to make the sentence more compact.<br /><br />Another learning point is cohesion, which is basically what distinguishes an A-range essay from a B-range essay. Cohesion is related to whether our essay seems logically and literally smooth and fluent. Sometimes your essay is comprised of individual sentences which are structurally and grammatically correct, but just doesn't look smooth on the whole. If that's the case, most likely what your essay lacks is cohesion.<br /><br />For those who are always stuck at level 5 in writing should particularly work on the cohesion of your writing because most likely it is what bars you from getting a 6 or even a 7. Once you've mastered how to make your essays coherent, you'll easily grab As in your other LANG and SOSC/HUMA essays afterward.",

This is a task-based course in which all the lectures would guide you through your assessed tasks. The course aims to enhance your writing and speaking abilities. The content is pretty boring to be honest, but it gives you some good insights and strategies on giving speeches and academic writing. Attendance is taken but it is not counted towards your final grade, but Fiona said the school office would call you if you skipped lessons.<br /><br />There are two units and an elective you must complete:<br /><br />Unit 1, People, Passion Possibilities (Focused on Speaking)<br /><br />Unit 2, Game Changers (Focused on Writing)<br /><br />Elective, Research and Referencing Skills (Focused on citation skill)",

Don’t do them sloppily or else you would get a bad grade. The library quiz doesn’t affect your grade though. <br />My grade: (4/4)<br /><br />Writing Task (30%): The main dish, write a 600-800 words essay exploring a past game changer. You must follow the directions given during lessons.<br />My grade: (18+1/21) *1 bonus point for correct citation<br /><br />Speaking Task 2 (20%): 4-min presentation given in front of the class about your chosen game changer. Practice it thoroughly and don’t rely on cue cards if you can, most of my classmates and I could give our speeches confidently without them. <br />My grade: (20/21)<br /><br />Vocabulary Record (20%): Complete 3 vocabulary records, 40 provided words for each record, give definitions and sample sentences. Don’t copy directly from dictionary if you want better grade. <br />My grade: (4/4)<br /><br />My result: A+<br />Getting A-range isn’t difficult if you can follow all the instructions given and spend time refining your work.",

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfil the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence – e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically – necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education.<br /><br />In this course, you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course project will help you to develop these further.<br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />1.write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />2. use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />3. extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.",

You have to find one game changer as the topic for your two Assessed Writing Tasks. <br />I would not say the course material is very relevant to your University Studies. But I find the part of introducing citation of sources pretty useful for your academic writing in the future.",

Just treat her as one of your friends then it would be fine. She likes to have Timed Speaking and Discussion sessions.

There are three types of assignment, vocab tests, speaking assignments and writing assignments. We had two vocab tests, two speaking assignments and two writing assignments. Everything we had learned in and after class turned out to be very useful in those assignments.<br />Diligence and hard work will always pay off.

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.",

You will write one expository paragraph. You should complete the form below and submit it to your instructor. Your instructor will tell you how.<br /><br />At the end of Week 11 you will submit your second piece of written work for assessment. It is an expository essay, in which you introduce a past game-changing idea and explain its impact.<br /><br />In Week 12 or 13, you will give a talk on a past game changer.",

There are many things to be aware of. Such as nominalisation, avoid using adjectives but more nouns etc. This is far different from what in learned in HKDSE syllabus! <br /><br />It is required to buy a textbook.($41HKD)",

She would show the outstanding work from other students and told us what is good about it. From her teaching, I could feel that she is a very experienced instructor and gives out many useful materials. However, her lessons were sometimes boring.

No final exam. <br /><br />There are 2 assessed speaking tasks, 2 writing tasks, and a vocab quiz. <br /><br />The first speaking task is about Inspiring Possibility. You are advised to include a story in a 3-minute speech. The speech is videotaped. <br />The second speaking task is 3.5 minutes. The topic is about a PAST game changer. <br /><br />The first writing task is a 200-word exploratory essay and needed to be done in class. You need to prepare an article related with a game changer that you chose. The second writing task follows the first task and had to complete a whole essay based on the paragraph that you wrote in the first task.<br /><br />For the vocab quiz, just complete the 120-word bank on VOLT. Complete the activities and games. Do some regular study and the quiz is not hard. Just fill in the blanks but beware of the word form.",

For A stream students, they may find it familiar since many techniques taught in classes may have been studied by themselves before, such as use of anecdotes, intonation and delivery as well as academic writing. There are also optional reading materials which allow you to obtain more relevant information for the course.

She always finds some videos and shows it in the lesson. She also encourages us to discuss. In almost every lesson, we are required to have some small-scale discussions and share our ideas.

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.<br />The course is graded and carries three credits.<br /><br />*Honestly, no one can be 'more proficient' in English by just taking a lang course in just one semester. The only useful thing is the format of citation, which is included as a part of the course.",

Also, you may want to consider Bruce if you're not a talkative person. You may also want to consider him if you don't want to meet a lot of new friends from LANG classes. Basically, I don't need to talk or do any sorts of discussions or interactions in his lessons. So, yup, you know what I mean.",

It mainly talks about possibility mindset which is related to the first assessed speaking task. The instructor will talk about how to convey the message of 'possibility' through a good story. The second unit is about the game changer which will discuss different game changers like the discovery of oil, the invention of iphone etc. This is related to the essay writing and second assessed speaking task. But I would say the content are quite useless because they are just commonsense. All you have to learn is the writing skills like using noun phrases, using complex sentence structures in writing etc and also speaking skills.",
            "comment_teaching": "He is quite interactive with us because he always asks us questions in class and I encourage you guys to answer his questions actively because again I think some impression marks are in the assignments. Also, he always lets us have discussions during class so be prepared to talk more in his class. All in all, he teaches the speaking skills and writing skills clearly and tells us the requirements for all speaking tasks and writing. So, follow his instructions and you will be okay. Also, for the essay writing, we have to quote different sources and we have to make in-text citation using APA style. He did teach us the format of APA style and introduces a very useful website in making in-text citation which you can directly copy it in your essay. However, he didn't tell us to make the reference list in alphabetical order and most of us couldn't get that one bonus mark for reference. So, be aware of using alphabetical order in making the reference list.",

Make sure to reg his class! <br />At last, there is an item called attendance in canvas and I got 100% for it. I don't know if attendance affects your mark but I strongly encouraged you to attend all the classes because I think there are some impression marks in your assignments.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say the workload is okay, not too heavy, not too low. I have only used one night in my essay writing(not including finding sources) and he gave me full marks so I was very surprised. But I would say if you want to get higher marks in speaking, you must have spent more time to practice your speech to sound more fluent and confident, so it may spend you more time. I think these tasks have their values but for the vocabulary records, they are just useless and I spend the most in doing these rubbish vocab records. I almost spent a week in each vocab record and you have to do 40 vocabs each time. So leave more time for vocab records.",

The second one you just need to complete the whole article about a game-changer, you can use the paragraph submitted in the first writing test<br /><br />There are constant deadlines for you to complete. After the first speaking test, you will need to work for the next test. I think I end up spending quite a large proportion of time on this course.

You are not given the flexibility argue on the validity of your answer.

A library workshop that teaches you how to cite sources is hosted at this stage. Even if you don't care about participation marks, I highly recommend you attend it to avoid plagiarism in your work.<br /><br />The fourth task is a talk about your past game-changer which is presented in front of the class. Basically, all you have to do is convert your essay into a speech. Easier said than done. Fortunately, this course introduces many techniques that help engage your audience during your talk.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that there is a textbook designed for this course that is mandatory to have?

If in most sections you achieve a score between 6-7, the final grade should be an A. 5 represents a B and 4 downwards is C, D.. etc.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is fair. Some say it is quite a lot and some say it is not. You have 3 vocabulary tests during the course of the semester. each worth 5%. Then you have 2 writing tasks ( essay) , a final individual speaking task and 10% is allocated to class participation. The spacing of the assessments makes the workload fair. However, with my professor, homework's were not necessary and she left it up to us. This can make the workload quite less however most teachers do not do this.",

Although attendance does not count towards the final grade (the attendance component that he posts on canvas is fake), you can make new friends in class :)<br /><br />- the classes are not very useful. When he talks about things that are not so useful, you can pretend to be listening but instead be daydreaming in ur head :)<br /><br />- the library quiz on citing sources and the bunch of &quot;imported assignments&quot; in canvas (e.g. practice citing sources in APA style...) are useless. You just have to finish them, the correctness doesn't matter. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can blindly guess the ans, which is exactly what I did, didn't even bother to read the questions before choosing the answer.<br /><br />- Treat vocab records seriously. For &quot;what I have learnt&quot;part, try to choose at least two aspects among &quot;synonyms, antonyms, collocations, formality...&quot;<br /><br />- For the first and second speaking tasks, try memorizing the script. You should not seem to be reading from the script, which is super unnatural. Record yourself and practice a few times beforehand to make sure the whole speech is smooth, natural, and not too exaggerated.<br /><br />- For the essay writing process, try to make the proposal as detailed as possible to make him think that you are well-prepared. Also, when he meets with you, ask him for recommendations (structure, opening, ending) to make your essay better. Keep asking him for his preferences and requirements as much as possible and follow them when you are writing the final essay.<br /><br />- For the essay, remember to use wt he taught in class. (hedging, more noun clauses, longer sentences...). And follow his preferences. For the reference list, remember to arrange the author names in Alphabetical order (which he didn't teach in class and all of us lost the bonus mark)<br /><br />- He is a nice guy. Try to ask him for his preferences for each and every assessment (speaking, essay, vocab...) and follow them, then you will get a good grade. Ask him in class or after class because he doesn't usually reply to emails.",

The essay has to have 500-800 words, that is, in fact, not much. So you really need to make your content as concise as possible. Make sure to check your citations so that they are all correct. You can earn a bonus point for that.<br /><br />The first speaking task has to be videotaped and be submitted on canvas. So you should probably record a few times and see which one you think is the best before you hand in your work.<br /><br />The second speaking task has to be done in class in front of your classmates. It is about a game-changer, most likely the one you have written in your writing task.",
