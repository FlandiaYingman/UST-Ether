The mean score is usually around 9 but it isn't uncommon for some unlucky students to score 6 or 7 only at times.<br /><br />For Lab Notebooks/Reports, the TAs are usually looking for any mistakes to deduct marks. You can do a hundred things correctly but you'll lose 5 marks (out of 100) for the most trivial mistake. <br /><br />Lastly, the grading...<br /><br />You need a freaking 93% to even get an A-!!!!! Bruh wth??!! Never seen an advanced course where you can get 90+ and only get a B range This ain't a Common Core course goddammit!! The amount of work you need to do in this course is outta this world but the least they could do was provide a more generous grading. I thought UST was supposed to provide grades based on ILOs but they literally just curve this shit. They seriously increased the grade threshold by 6% from last year cuz the mean was higher (that's called curving!!!)",

Definitely not worth 3 credits. On top of this, the grading isn't all that great. If this was not a major requirement, I would've avoided it at all costs.",

It is graded out of 100 points and as long as you stick to the requirements and don't leave out anything major you can get 90.<br />Lastly, there is lab 6 for which you will form a group of 3 and design your own lab. You hand in a proposal, lab notebook and report.

This will be easier if you have friends on the course, but I'm an exchange student, so I don't know anyone very well. <br /><br />In short, I cannot stress enough just how much work this is. The lab reports are due in for weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10, so they have an annoying way of clashing with midterms too.<br /><br />If you want a smaller work load, take 3153 instead.
