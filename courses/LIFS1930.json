Before the final, I feel stressed, so I go through all the materials in a very few hours. That's when I feel &quot;chur&quot;. However, the final exam is not difficult.

Just pay attention during class to catch the IPRS and answer the prof's questions. Who could have known that Profs are more inclined to help a student outside of class hours if they participate during class.<br /><br />The bulk of the grade was made up of a 1000 Word Essay where you were you could choose between one of two open-ended questions. We didn't have a final exam due to the sem being online. The Essay is really a hit or miss as they don't really give you a lot of guidance.

This depends on your understanding of the content. If you have enough studying then 90 minutes are much more than enough to complete. Just note that a few questions are based on what is said during tutorial but not the contents on canvas. Also bioethics will also be in the exam.<br /><br />The 20% essay is the real deal. I bet this is where grades are determined actually as the above 80% are just too easy to get high score. A difference in two or three marks here may cause a difference in grade, I suppose.<br /><br />Although I get nearly 90% in the quizzes, obtain a handful(at least a bit above average?) of bonus marks, and performing really well in exam, eventually I got a B+ only. I guess my essay ruined the whole thing...although I don't know why. The course does not let you know your essay marks as well as the final exam, so I have no idea what went wrong. I won't appeal though, because this should probably be the only lifs course i am taking, so I would rather work harder on the subjects i am interested in.<br /><br />Well, in another perspective, this means that those without a biology background can also strike for an A range in the course just like those who have, and I really have this kind of friend (we are both in year 1) who ended up an A+. This is the only reason I gave it a D but not an E.",
            "comment_workload": "Not high.<br />The time required to read the course material is at most several hours per topic, and if you omit the videoes it takes probably less than an hour. I don't recommend this though because they are worth watching. For the quizzes, you can safely refer to the internet, although careful reading the course material once is enough to get you a nine out of ten, the remaining mark depends on how careful you read the question. Tutorials are in a light mood and you can choose to attend but daydreaming,&nbsp;&nbsp;but the questions are not hard and many of them has no fixed answer, so try to raise your hand a bit occasionally.<br />If not the essay this part would be an A --- yes now I really hate that 400 word essay after grades are out.",

Chapter 7-12 gives an introduction to genetics.<br /><br />The materials are not easy to understand mainly because the length of different parts in a chapter is not properly assigned.<br /><br />It is common to see that the notes just defined a term then move on to the next part, while you don't really know why you need to know that term.<br /><br />The notes for Ch. 4-6 is very lengthy, having paragraphs for every point, but the notes for Ch. 7-12 is too brief, far from sufficient to understand a concept. I mostly rely on the notes I made during my DSE period to deal with these chapters.",
            "comment_teaching": "Only one 80-min. tutorial every week, no lectures. <br /><br />The lecturers will assume you already know everything about the chapter before the tutorial, which is usually about a case-study.<br /><br />The lecturers do take attendances, so you still have to attend the tutorials even if the contents mostly do not appear in the exam.",
            "comment_grading": "The exam (60%) is a 40-question MC, 1.5 hr is given to finish it.<br />The MC are also very easy, in the sense that if you memorized everything in the materials. <br /><br />If you did memorize the definitions of all the relevant terms, you will definitely know the answers, and you will definitely not know the answer if you did not memorize all of the relevant terms.<br /><br />So here comes the problem. this course is not specifically designed for year 1 students, I found quite a lot of higher year students, even year 4 students studying in this course. <br /><br />With a very easy exam, the higher year students are likely to get near full marks in the course.<br /><br />Year 1 student will struggle really hard to get satisfying grade in this course. <br /><br />Note: You will not know your marks of your essay and your final exam.",

That makes me nervous as well, as if you make mistakes for 1 question, there shall be great change to your grade.<br />But generally speaking, as far as I know, the grading is farily nice.

You can look for answer of Cheung's quizzes via Google (somehow I usually can't find answer to quizzes in self-learning materials), not sure about Tang's ones. Lam's and Leung's quizzes require a good understanding of the self-learning materials, but you can find nearly all answers in the materials.<br /><br />In general, I don't think the workload is high. Even the written assignment requires 400 words only. You may further reduce your workload if you have a solid background in life science.<br />(For me, I am year 1 with non-LIFS intended major. I have studied HKDSE biology but didn't study LIFS1902. You can be non-attentive during class and study 2~3 days before final exam if you have similar/better LIFS background as mine.)",

You will NEVER know why you get super bad grade. Although I think it is a easy course, with most of the questions in the quiz I know how to answer, it turns out that I got a B- only. What is the problem behind? <br />My confidence originates from the results of lifs1902, since I got A- from that. And this course is even&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot easier and simpler than lifs1902. But why I would get just a B- in lifs1930!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Lifs1930 is supposed to let some students with no prior biology background to study, so the concepts should be simpler.
