            "comment_content": "I have taken a lot of courses in the past where professors pull out of a certain topic right when things start to get interesting. This course was quite the contrary, it covered a lot of content from many different perspectives (i.e: when talking about platform monetization we analyzed dozens of strategies with real world examples) which grounded the course in reality. The content taught here will be incredibly useful to anyone who wants to understand more about platform architecture, algorithms, competition, and the gig economy amongst many others.<br /><br />content covered included:<br /><br />1. Platform architecture and Network effects<br />2. Chicken and egg problem<br />3. Data and matching<br />4. Monetization and platform canvas<br />5. Platform pricing and Disintermediation<br />6. Traction-Friction, Virality, Openness, and Platform metrics<br />7. Platform competition<br />8. Sharing/gig economy and platform vs pipeline business",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Kim is really great, he is well versed with the content of the course and eager to listen to new concepts the students present in their mini-presentations and incorporate them into his future lessons. <br />Gets mildly boring sometimes given it's a 3-hour lecture but try to listen to him very closely if you want a good grade, understanding the concepts is the only way to ace the final.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading scheme was based on six components:<br /><br />Class attendance: 6% <br />Class contribution: 4%<br />Quiz: 10%<br />Mini presentation: 10%<br />Final project: 35%<br />Final exam: 35%<br /><br />The mean or sd for the components were not released but the curve for the course is quite steep :)<br /><br />92.5% - A+<br />90.5% - B+",
            "comment_workload": "Everyone gets full for the mini-presentation given it's a good topic. The final exam is where you have to work the hardest.<br /><br />Kinda heavy workload but it's the same with most summer courses. Just attend all the lectures and try to finish the projects ASAP and you should be fine.",

The three keywords that sum up the modern digital revolution are online/digital platforms, AI-driven machines, and crowds. Platforms are transforming technology, banking, logistics, media industries to name a few. A platform brings in distinct groups of ecosystem partners who is to join the platform network under the condition that doing so creates value for them. Information and communication technologies (ICT) and artificial intelligence (AI) enable and drive digital platforms, creating and nurturing networks, and facilitating value-creating matches and interactions. Instead of remaining as passive consumers, crowds actively participate in platforms as providers of contents, products, services, and social currency. The three elements are so intertwined that one canâ€™t be comprehended without the others.",
