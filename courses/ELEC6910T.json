        "description": "This course focuses on deep learning and its applications in various areas. The topics include the basis of deep learning and its applications in computer vision, speech processing, optimization, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Specifically, various forms of deep neural networks will be introduced, such as convolutional neural networks, context aggregation networks, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. The students have the opportunities to implement deep learning models for some AI tasks such as image understanding, image synthesis, graph analysis, and speech enhancement.",
