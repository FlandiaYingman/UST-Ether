        "description": "This course focuses on concepts and tools that can generate operational excellence for the production and delivery of services across various industries including healthcare, ride-hailing, advertising, and various types of financial services. Unlike traditional product markets, a salient feature of these industries is that services are often intangible and not storable, and often high variable, which raises significant challenges in decision making. The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This course will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations. Students will also have the opportunity to apply these concepts in various service industries by conducting a group project.",

As Shin assumes that you are proficient at Excel's basic function and his pace of teaching is fast. Trust me , you will never understand what is going on if there is no recording provided.",
