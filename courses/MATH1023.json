I'd directly quote what the Prof said.<br /><br />Study Tips for MATH 1023<br /><br />Rule of Thumb for all university MATH courses (not just 1023)<br /><br />Put continuous effort in the course throughout the semester! Understand all fundamental concepts by regularly attending lectures, reading lecture notes, and discussing with teaching staff and classmates. Develop your mathematical maturity and problem-solving skills through exercises and homework. Don't expect you can skip all lectures or exercises, and then &quot;爆seed&quot; by intensive/overnight revision the day before the exams! It is impossible to absorb all course materials in just one night.<br /><br />(see the meaning of &quot;爆seed&quot; here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)<br /><br />Be critical<br /><br />Don't just learn math superficially by memorizing formulae or by following homework solutions blindly. University level math, especially this honor course, emphasizes much more on logical thinking than high school math. Always ask for the reasons and make sure you are able to justify every step. Don't feel satisfied by just asking &quot;how&quot;, but ask also &quot;why&quot;, &quot;what if&quot;, &quot;under what conditions&quot;, &quot;what's good&quot;, etc. To get started, you should first change the mindset that learning math is not about memorizing or doing routine calculations.<br /><br />Be logical<br /><br />When you learn a theorem, don't just look at the &quot;formula part&quot;. It is more important to keep in mind the necessary conditions and hypotheses in order to apply those theorem. For instance, look at the statement:<br />LaTeX: \\displaystyle\\text{If } \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L \\text { and } \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = M, \\text{ then } \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) + g(x) = L + M. If&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) = L&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g ( x ) = M ,&nbsp;&nbsp;then&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) + g ( x ) = L + M .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Many high school students would just memorize the rule that:<br />LaTeX: \\displaystyle{\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) + g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) + \\lim_{x \\to a}g(x)} lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) + g ( x ) = lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) + lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g ( x )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />but ignore the assumption that both LaTeX: \\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\text{ and } \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x )&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g ( x )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to exist (and finite) in order to make use of this rule.<br /><br />In this course, you should always pay attention to the assumptions and conditions of a theorem. Ask yourself whether the theorem would fail if these conditions are not met. Furthermore, such a condition or assumption must be used somewhere in the proof, ask yourself where this condition appears in the proof and why it is needed!<br /><br />Be a good listener<br /><br />While my lectures will be based on the lecture notes, they are not merely the &quot;audio&quot; version of the notes. By just reading the lecture notes, you may only learn how to do math, but in lectures/tutorials you will learn why math is done that way, and in the long-run you will also learn the way of thinking of the instructor and TAs. Therefore, try to focus on listening and thinking during class. Taking notes (blindly) may hinder your thoughts. All blackboard notes written during a lecture will be recorded in a PDF that you can check it up later.<br /><br />Work smart (not just work hard)<br /><br />Learning mathematics -- just like learning &quot;九陰真經&quot; -- requires intensive practicing, deciphering, but not just passively by quick reading (though mathematics is not like &quot;葵花寶典&quot; that you need to &quot;sacrifice&quot; in order to learn it). Do relevant exercises soon after a lecture. Work hard and do more exercises than assigned; but work smart -- don't just do exercises of the same type over and over again. After you feel confident with basic and routine problems, go deeper on more structured and thought-provoking problems to broaden your knowledge and skills. Don't just do ALL exercises in ONE book, but do SOME exercises in SEVERAL books. Kenneth Ross's book on Elementary Analysis is a good one. Some structured problems of the deceased HKALE Pure Math were very well written -- that you can learn something new in a &quot;guided&quot; way.<br /><br />Learn from people<br /><br />Math is not fun if you learn it alone. Form a small group (such as with your highschool-mates, o'camp group-mates) to study the course together. Whenever you find difficulty in a homework problem, discuss it with your friends first to exchange ideas. If the problem is still not resolved, ask instructors and TAs for hint. If you are afraid of finding the instructor and TAs alone, go together with your group.",

We were suggested to do many optional work, like Latex work, bonus questions and finding exercises by ourselves(although I personally didn't do this one).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Generally if you are adequate and aiming at doing well with a math major, you'd better take Mr. Fong's suggestion seriously.",

            "comment_content": "Before the midterm, the course covers the rigorous definition of limits (That is how to prove for example that the limit as x approaches a of x^2 = a^2 using well defined mathematical formulations and being rigorous while doing so). This part emphasized proofs and professor Hu Proved everything he wrote, and I mean everything. You won't be expected to repeat his proofs in the exam but you are expected to understand them since you can use a similar way to prove other questions he might ask. Also, he covers all the differentiation rules and again proofs the product rule, quotient rule, etc. After the midterm, he focused on on the applications such as optimization problems, sketching graphs, intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem, L'hospital rule, local and global minima and maxima, concavity, etc. Overall, the course has a really rewarding content and I definitely recommend taking it if 1) you don't care about the grade that much and 2) if you are going to major in maths. The course has improved my mathematical maturity so much and made me think of most stuff in terms of their proofs and definitions, definitely a well constructed calculus course and is almost the same difficulty (if not harder) than other calculus courses in other US universities such as MIT and Caltech, etc.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Hu, for me is one of the best mathematics professors that ever thaught me in my life. He has many famous sentences such as: &quot;You don't know the definition, you get a big 0&quot; and &quot;Your intuition tells you that this limit is 0? well my intuition tells me that YOU get a 0&quot; and finally &quot;Analysis is a hard subject, every year at least 3 people commit suicide in MIT because of analysis:&quot;. Professor Hu teaching is extremely funny and laid down and you can sense he enjoys what he does, he focuses on two things: LOGIC and DEFINITION, if you lack one in your answer then you're getting a big 0. For example, the limit as x approaches infinity of (1/(x+4)) = 0 since the denominator grows to infinity and 1 divided by a very big number is 0. if you write this in the exam you get a 0. To get the mark, you can either 1) proof that the limit of 1/x+4 is indeed 0 by the DEFINITION or use logic and algebraic manipulation to write 1/x+4 as (1/x)/(1+4/x). since we know limit as x approaches infinity of 1/x = limit of 4/x&nbsp;&nbsp;= 0 and by the continuity of the polynomials, the limit is 0/(1+0) = 0/1 = 0 therefore we conclude the limit is 0. See how many steps we needed to show the limit of such an easy limit is 0? you have to follow similar arguments in ALL your answers or else, a big 0.<br /><br />A final word about the TA (Xilin Li), this is arguably one of the best TAs in the maths department, the guy is very nice, he explains things thoroughly and you can meet him after class and he would even explain FULL lessons to you after class if you need it, he is always at the maths support center most of the time and I honestly wouldn't have gotten my A- without this guy. Seriously a life saver.<br /><br />Also, for the lecture notes, review the attachments below, study from these notes since they are much harder and rigorous than the Stewart calculus book. everyone studies from it.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is shit, no way to put it except this way. The students who take this course are all really mathematically mature and well, really really good in maths. When I went to professor Hu at the beginning of the year, I asked him if I should take the course since I am an international student and most students who take it are from mainland (if not all of them) and they are known to be the best in maths. He told me you should take it butt you might get a C or C+ even if you're good because these guys are really good, I ended up in the end getting an A- (Even though I regard myself to be exceptional in mathematics and I ranked in the top 1.8 percentile in the maths exam in my country) and I studied a lot! So if this tells you something, its that the course is full of good people, and in the end, around 40% got A- or higher and I barely hit the A- level. So be very careful if you need to maintain a certain gpa for your scholarship, I know you might really think you are very good in maths, but so did I and you're going to have to work your ass off just to get an A.<br /><br />45% midterm, 5% H.W, and 50% finals.",

Instead of just knowing how to do limits, differentiation, and remember certain theorems (what taught in 1013), I can actually know the reasoning and proofs behind.<br />As a local DSE student with neither math competition experience nor self-learned everything, I did feel extreme pain switching from M2 style computation-based math to MATH 1023 style rigorousness. However, it is quite satisfying once you can understand the theorems reasonably well (Doesn't need A+ level understanding to feel this satisfaction), basically opening a new world to you and make you view mathematics differently.<br /><br />Slight criticism though:<br />The amount of content and level of difficulty (especially for Professor Ip's years) is a bit too much for a year 1 3-credit course.",

His English is quite good and the accent is very audible. He handwrites notes using a digital note-taking application as he speaks, and his font is acceptable.<br />He is well prepared before he comes to class and knows the content well, and explanation of content is quite clear. Even if he made a mistake, he will make corrections as soon as possible.<br />His teaching speed is quite fast, but is still acceptable to me.<br />He often includes jokes and easter eggs (eg. uses anime scenes as his Zoom virtual background) suring lectures and in homework/ exams.<br />If you do not understand, Professor Ip welcomes anyone to ask questions after the lesson, he will explain all of them clearly (except for the time he rushed to the cinema to watch One Piece Film Red). You can also ask questions on the discord server, as Professor Ip replies very quickly (at most within few hours).<br />Bonus: As Professor Ip is also a musician, he often invites us to attend his concerts.<br />Bonus 2: If you want to, he also doesn't mind eating lunch/ dinner with his students. Feel free to invite him to LG7 and chat casually with him on math, music and ACG stuff.<br /><br />My TA was Hiu Chi Sit, so I cannot comment on Yunhe Li.<br /><br />Hiu Chi Sit is a good TA.<br />Sadly, as he is always very sleepy, his voice lacks energy and may be hypnotizing to some people (not to me though). His English is good, and the accent is very audible.<br />He handwrites notes using a digital note-taking application as he speaks, yet his font is slightly unclear but still readable.<br />Hiu Chi Sit can explain the tutorial questions quite clearly.<br />However, he also have the problem of teaching a bit too fast.<br />If you have questions, you can raise them anytime, and he do not mind answering them. And if you have a lot of problems, he will answer most of them (before he gets too tired) as he marks homework in the library/ LIFS common.<br />He is also a very caring TA, as he encouraged me to move forward and not compare with others after I told him I fried my mid term.",

I can understand most of the concepts only because I have knowledgeble friends and kind professor and TAs.<br />It should take at least 4 or 5 days of studying before each exam.<br /><br />I know that some may do extra exercise (eg. Rudin's textbook, HKALE, etc.), but homework and revision already took up most of my time, so I did not have time to find any.<br /><br />This course will mess with your study schedule, sleep schedule, reduce your freetime, and give you depression (since your classmates are very strong) to some extent, depending on your ability.<br />I personally sacrificed a lot of sleep time to finish the homework.<br /><br />To (hopefully) decrease your workload in your first fall semester, please study HKALE Pure Mathematics/ mathematical analysis as soon as possible. Although it may not help you solve Professor Ip's extra hard questions, prestudying can certainly help you understand the concepts more easily.<br />In case you are about to take this course, please kindly remind your cute 師弟師妹s, thankyou~",

What's special about this course is that it emphasizes on mathematical rigor, i.e. every statement should be precisely defined or logically sound (up to some assumptions); which means the MATH1023 will focus on these points:<br />· Motivation + Observations<br />· Conceptual Understanding<br />· Logical Definitions<br />· Theorems (+Proofs)<br />· Examples &amp; Applications.<br /><br />And as you can see, it is very different than MATH1012 or 1013 since they are both mostly focused on computations,which is why the course is highly recommended to those who are planning to do a maths major (specifically pure maths) or even doing theoretical physics.<br /><br />This course is very different than school maths because it exposes you to the world of proofs and conceptual understanding of math, but it gives you a great learning experience that you won't find in any other course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ivan is a good teacher overall. He planned his lectures well and is very well aware about the order he should be explaining about.<br /><br />In contrast to some lecturers who simply read and copy whatever the lecture notes says; Ivan, even though he uses the same lecture notes (Yan Min's lecture notes), it's clear that he puts a lot of effort in each lecture so that the session will go smoothly and fun. He's also open to questions, so don't be afraid to ask him some questions :)<br /><br />In short, he is good at teaching and also a humorous guy where you can joke around with.",
            "comment_grading": "Ivan gives two schemes in grading:<br />Homework = 20%<br />Midterm = 40% / 10%<br />Finals = 40% / 70%<br /><br />So even if you screwed your midterms, you can still make a comeback in the finals by using the 10-70 scheme! (which I personally did). But Ivan is very generous in giving grades to his students even though the questions he gave are relatively hard, about 40% of the students are in A range, which is something... Here are some statistics:<br /><br />Midterm grade distribution:<br />Out of 100<br />Mean = 43.38<br />SD = 21.05<br />Min = 2<br />Max = 103 (wtf)<br /><br />Finals grade distribution:<br />Out of 100<br />Mean = 46.37<br />SD = 18.95<br />Min = 8<br />Max = 97 (wtf)<br /><br />Overall grade distribution:<br />Out of 100<br />Mean = 52.78<br />SD = 21.93<br />Min = 1.06 (audit)<br />Max = 98.91 (also audit....)",
            "comment_workload": "This is an Honors course, so it should be expected that the workload will NOT be light.<br /><br />In Ivan's courses, he will give a homework in every week which consists of 4 questions (not including sub-questions + optional problem) that has a deadline of 2 weeks after the homework is released (but each homework is released every week, so the deadline is kind of 1 week -_-)<br /><br />The questions Ivan gives are interesting, you probably have never seen those questions before, solving them might take some time (if you're an average student like me) but it does give more insights to the topic, and that is what makes Ivan's 1023 special.<br /><br />Since this is an Honors course, please do make time to study if you want to have a high grade, learn from many different sources as possible, Ivan will NOT give exam questions that are like the homeworks, so you have to force yourself to be exposed to different and new questions to be prepared for his exam.<br /><br />With all that, best of luck in your 1023 journey! 👐",

Especially Ivan's exam is pretty much hell. However, this course offer a wide range of math knowledge. You will experience the amazing world of math. To survive in this course (as a local DSE people) , I suggest you to learn HKALE Pure Math (if possible, learn 1980-1990's syllabus as HKALE Pure Math syllabus cut some content after 2000s) asap in order to have a better foundation for the course. As a local M2 DSE normal player, HKDSE IS NOT ENOUGH.DSE Stars don't really matter). Also you need to be have a rigorous mindset. <br /><br />Useful resources as a local normal DSE M2 student:<br /><br />Herman Yeung*** Pure Maths 再現系列 (2012 AL Pure Maths syllabus) : https://www.youtube.com/@HermanYeung<br />***note that some &quot;skills&quot; like 倒轉做 in equality is NOT useful when proofing limits(∀ϵ&gt;0,∃δ&gt;0s.t.0&lt;|x−c|&lt;δ⟶|f(x)−L|&lt;ϵ). Watch HY only allow you to learn basics in Pure Maths but don't guarantee you perform well(like helping you get an A) in 1023.<br />probably 90s HKALE Pure Maths syllabus: https://www.adrian.idv.hk/2007-03-27-hkale/<br />Real analysis course in HKUST: (MATH2033):https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~makyli/UG.html<br />(MATH2043):https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/41781<br />also previous 1023 course is helpful too<br />Also google baby rudin pdf which is useful for analysis",
            "comment_teaching": "Ivan is a great teacher. During lessons, he doesn't just read lecture notes like a text reader. He tries his best explaining the concept to students(although sometimes some content is hard and I don't understand). He also include worksheet during lessons and demostrate how to solve a problem. However, unlike secondary school teachers(M2 teachers), He kinda teach really fast(relative to secondary school teacher). When doing WS questions, he kinda skip tons of step(once skip a HKALE level MI proof). If you think your secondary school teacher is medium to fast, then Ivan is SPEEDRUNNING. However he include (probably) many memes and anime background in zoom recording. He include SHREK'S SWAMP in the background once. Also Ivan welcomes everyone asking question after lessons or during breaks(even answer outsyl 1023 questions). He have a discord server which is COOL. If you want to skip this course lessons, I encourage you. Don't skip them.<br /><br />Also TA are good too (Mr Hiu Chi Sit). His tutorial explain many ideas in solving problems. However, like Ivan, he really teach fast and skipping steps. Ask Ivan if you have questions in content. Ask TA if you want to know how to solve problems/exercises.<br /><br />BTW don't call Professor Ip Mr IP<br /><br />Ivan Ip — 2022/12/01 17:14<br />Ivan&nbsp;&nbsp;✅<br />Dr. Ip ✅<br />Prof. Ip ✅<br />イップ先生✅<br />アイヴァンさん✅<br />Mr. Ip ❌<br /><br />if you know Russian you can call him Сэр Ивaн(Ser Ivan)<br /><br />You can eat Subway sandwich with Ivan",

As a local DSE M2 normal people and not too hardworking (DON'T BE TOO LAZY), and kind of &quot;mess up&quot; my final, I got a B. It is suggested to spend more time in grinding or doing questions, so you can get a higher chance to get A range.<br />Note that if you are local M2 student, don't expect you can get very high marks as there is many non local (especially mainland) tryhards. Unless you are that local genius who get 103/100 in mid term and almost full mark in final, try your best to get A range. If not (perhaps scared to have bad grade(broken🐢)) you can choose to accept you are getting B range (if you really do your best) or choose to audit (except for local IRE student who want to be math major) and take MATH1013 L1(special section which has more content than normal 1013 but less hard than 1023).<br /><br /> You all still have chance to get an A in this course (depending on your performance of final examination(I guess)).",
            "comment_workload": "As a local M2 student, workload is kind of heavy. The heavy workload isn't because of many question to do but the questions are very very hard (unless you are a genius)and the very hard exam. Overall there is 2 exams and 10 homeworks but each homework take many hours to do. Normally 1 homework has 4 questions with sub part. To perform well, It is suggested to constantly do revision. This course IS NOT DSE. 裸考 don't work and probably result in poor performance. Study HKALE Pure Maths and 預習MATH1023/MATH2033/MATH2043 definitely help.<br />If you have time type LaTex as it has bonus.<br /><br />study tips:<br />https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/14142/pages/study-tips-for-math-1023?module_item_id=137483<br />https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/32438/pages/study-tips-for-math-1023",

            "comment_content": "The course will be mainly talking about limits and derivatives.<br /><br />Limit:<br />Rigorous definition of sequence and function limit(ipsilon and derta definition, ipsilon and N definition)(Very important)<br />Continuity <br /><br />Derivative:<br />Computation of derivative<br />Linear approximation<br />Taylor's theorem<br />L'Hospitals rule<br />Convex functions<br />Curve sketching<br />Newton's method<br /><br />For the textbook, professor uses different textbooks, including Yan Min's Calculus, baby rudin and lax calculus. Homework will come from those textbook.<br /><br />For examination, the exam put focus on calculations but not proofings, 1023 can (probably) be renamed as &quot;Honors calculational calculus I&quot;",
            "comment_teaching": "POOR TEACHING!!!<br /><br />He only talks to his hand-written notes without further explaining. The only thing he answers to a question asked by a student is &quot;Sorry, but I don't know how to answer this question yet&quot; Professor Xiong develops our self learning ability, which is SUPERRrrrrrr useful in university life.<br /><br />Also, the paper in which prof. Xiong set mainly focuses on calculation but not proofing. However, this is MATH1023, not MATH1013!!! How come there are more calculations than proofing.<br /><br />You know why I am joining 1023? I come here to learn how to PROOOF, not application!!!!! After all, I gain nothing. I learnt no proofing, moreover, my grade is &quot;rotten&quot;.<br /><br />Regarding his quiz, hmm, more and more easier. There are totally 7 quizzes(0-6), and only Quiz 2-6 are graded. Quiz 2 and quiz 3 look like that we are doing proofs, however, the quiz become more and more easier! From quiz 3 onward, the quiz become more computational. Quiz 4 and quiz 6 are about calculating derivatives, while quiz 5 is about calculating limits. No more MVT, no more Taylor, no more ipsilon-derta language... The mean of the quiz becomes higher and higher! Unbelievable!",
            "comment_grading": "ABSOLUTE GRADING!!!<br /><br />He claimed that only &gt;90% could have an A. I don't know how many people will get an A in his course as the mean for midterm was around 56.<br /><br />Anyway, in his &quot;moral lesson&quot;(Half lesson), at least have known that &quot;Grades are important, but not the most important.&quot;<br /><br />Grading scheme:<br />HW: 5%<br />Quiz:1% each, totally 5 quizzes.<br />Mid-term:35%<br />Final:55%<br /><br />I think I may not get a good grade. <br /><br />I didn't perform well in mid-term as they are mainly about proofs, so I did a lot of exercises of mathematical analysis, hoping that I can do proofing questions better, however, the questions in final are mainly about applications, not many proofs and therefore again, I didn't perform well in final.(Hmm,It seems that I am finding excuses for myself🤔)<br /><br />===UPDATE ON 22/12 and 3/1===<br /><br />Grades are out and I'm deciding to audit MATH1024 while taking MATH1014 for the next sem. I don't want such a course to lower my TGA. Choosing 1023 is my worst choice ever! It turned out that 1023 has the lowest letter grade in my 1st semester😢. As I said, &quot;After all, I gain nothing. I learnt no proofing, moreover, my grade is &quot;rotten&quot;.&quot;",
            "comment_workload": "I don't know how is the workload. I'm very disappointed with this course. Hardworking doesn't pay(maybe) in prof.Xiong's course!😢<br /><br />I put a lot of time, revising MVT, revising Taylor's theorem, revising limits, but sadly, 3/4 long questions put focus on computation of derivative, curve sketching and optimization, which I did not revise so much. Hard-working does not guarantee a good grade. However, if you don't work hard, you will certainly get a bad grade!",

Smooth function and real analytic function.<br /><br />One thing I like the most is how derivative is introduced in this course. The approximation approach is really intuitive and makes Taylor's polynomial natural to derive. I personally do not see this course as a course in mathematical analysis since not even the completeness of R was (frequently) mentioned with its importance emphasised till the last lecture.

            "comment_teaching": "----------------------------- 𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐔𝐑𝐄𝐒 -----------------------------<br /><br />The teaching is very concise and clear, but the speed is very fast. His English accent is good enough for us to follow, and he knows Cantonese as well. You are free to ask him questions after the lecture. There is usually a 5 min break in the middle of a lecture, so your brain can take a rest.<br /><br />The handwriting is done on GoodNotes with screen recording. If you cannot follow the pace, you can review the lecture by watching the video.<br /><br />The course content follows mainly Yan Min's notes, but occasionally there will be extra content with supplementary notes. Besides, there will be 1 worksheet per 1-2 lessons that demonstrates some approaches to easier problems.<br /><br />---------------------------- 𝐓𝐔𝐓𝐎𝐑𝐈𝐀𝐋𝐒 ----------------------------<br /><br />There is 1 tutorial per week, demonstrating some approaches to very difficult problems, a lot with long solutions that won't appear in homework or exams. However, I think more explanation can be done on how the solutions are achieved, instead of leaving us the impression that only experienced math students can come up with the solutions.<br /><br />------------------- 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐑𝐄𝐕𝐈𝐄𝐖 𝐒𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 -------------------<br /><br />Before the final exam, there will be a final review session revisiting the concepts, demonstrating some problems, and going through the cheat sheet.",

Therefore, make sure you put enough effort into preparing for the final exam.<br /><br />The grade is decent. A range is given to people with 60% total marks or above, though I was sadly 1.25 marks from A-. You secure a B+ if you are above the mean.<br /><br />-------------------------- 𝐁𝐎𝐍𝐔𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐒 --------------------------<br /><br />The homework offers a bonus course point of 0.2 by submitting a LaTeX-generated .pdf file and the original .tex file instead of handwriting. Therefore, you can get a total of 2 total course marks (without the *20% for homework). I think it is worth the time to type LaTeX, as the 2 course marks may be saving you for a higher grade.<br /><br />You can also earn a bonus course point of 0.2 by finding and reporting a typo in Yan Min's lecture notes, homework, or homework solutions, capped at 2 points. Yan Min's notes contain a decent amount of typos, especially in computation steps, but hard to find in my opinion since the notes are quite long. In contrast, I think typos are easier to be found in Ivan's homework solutions. Some easy ones are missing a &quot;d/dx&quot; and missing a limit symbol.<br /><br />There was also 1 bonus mark given by simply asking a question for the review session.<br /><br />With the highest possible bonus course points of 5, you can get one subgrade higher, so they are worth the time completely.<br /><br />------------------------------- 𝐄𝐗𝐀𝐌𝐒 -------------------------------<br /><br />The midterm and final exams are extremely difficult, you will feel like vomiting blood during the exams. The exams kick off with a very tricky question (What is the name of the mathematician in the portrait?) (What is the meaning of some weird notation?). Then, there are a few short questions, which are already quite difficult for normal people like me.<br /><br />Then, they are followed by 2-3 computation questions which are where most people get points from. Each is worth around 10 points. For your reference, midterm has limit computations that require you to apply basic limit knowledge like sinx/x-&gt;1 as x-&gt;0 and Squeeze Theorem, while final has limit computations that require you to apply the Taylor series (very ugly and tedious). Do not use a calculator to estimate the limit as the value may be extremely large.<br /><br />Afterward, there are 2 long problems with around 4 parts each. These are the most difficult questions that I usually don't know how to do. But by writing something, regardless of correctness, the lenient T.A.s may give at least 1 mark. You can write down the approach to a problem if you failed to work out the exact details, and you will usually get more than half of the marks.<br /><br />------------------------ 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐃𝐄 𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐄 ------------------------<br /><br />Finally, the final exam result and letter grades are quickly released within 24 hours after the final exam, so don't check your result if you think it may affect your performance in other final exams.",
            "comment_workload": "--------------------------- 𝐇𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐊 ---------------------------<br /><br />As a student who got 5** in DSE Math Core and 5* in M2, the workload was like an 8-credit course. But given this is an honor course, I would give the workload a D.<br /><br />There were a total of 10 homework. Each homework would be released each week, containing 4 compulsory long problems and 1 optional problem with 2-4 parts each. But the deadline was usually 2 weeks later, meaning there was a week of buffer in case you cannot finish it within the first week.<br /><br />The homework problems require a lot of thinking. Therefore, it's better to form groups to work on the homework, as lots of times, you wouldn't be able to come up with a solution. Usually, the solution only takes not more than 5 steps, so if your unsuccessful attempt is overly complicated, you may be in the wrong direction.<br /><br />It took me around 5 days to complete one homework at the beginning of the course, and it gradually reduced to 3 days per week as I got used to the rigorousness.<br /><br />However, the homework was very rewarding, not only because they were intellectually stimulating, but compared to MATH 1013 difficulty, you can have a good grasp of the concepts and computations in the topic, but it was completely not enough for handling Ivan's exams.<br /><br />-------------------------- 𝐁𝐎𝐍𝐔𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐒 --------------------------<br /><br />The homework offers a bonus course point of 0.2 by submitting a LaTeX-generated .pdf file and the original .tex file instead of handwriting. This also takes a lot of time, usually within 1 day. I recommend using the online platform Overleaf - https://overleaf.com for its good editor (e.g. highlight brackets, the drop-down list for commands) and auto-save function. If your eyesight is not that good, you can use Mathcha - https://mathcha.io as it is a live LaTeX editor, i.e. you can directly edit the preview of math expressions with LaTeX instead of typing LaTeX code and then compiling it for preview.<br /><br />If you are a perfectionist, do not fixate on the beauty of LaTeX, make sure you put enough effort into other courses and balance time well while you take this beast.",

I think the tutorials should attach more importance to problem-solving training.",

Personally I spent quite a lot of time on studying the first 3chapters of Maths 2043 so I can get to know the proofs of everything that is not included in this course like Cauchy Criterion and some more abstract examples.",

The course content is similar to what was required in Pure Mathematics of the former HKALE exam.<br /><br />This course is recommended to students who intend to pursue a research or academic career in Mathematics, OR those who have background knowledge about single-variable calculus. If you registered this course ONLY because you met the prerequisite (HKDSE M2 5 or above), you will have a very hard time studying this course.<br /><br />No textbook from the market is required. The course covers the first two chapters of the textbook Calculus written by Prof. Min Yan.",

Far from adequate to complete your homework or excel in exams.

In each homework, there are usually standard questions which you can complete as long as you attended lectures or read through the textbook. The remaining half will require much more thinking than what was needed to complete your high school homework. As a mathematics lover, I do enjoy thinking on those more difficult problems. But do expect that you have to spend hours on just one question on the homework.<br /><br />For exams, I would say both the mid-term and final exams are pretty standard, so I believe that you can score pretty well as long as you have done the exercise. Though Prof. Xiong recommended us to do ALL the exercise in Prof. Yan's textbook, I have NOT done so because there are really too many repetitive questions in the textbook. Just do enough so that you can understand the concept and get familiar with the computations. Not worthwhile to do all if taken into account the law of diminishing marginal return.",

The professor is also very kind and patient that you can feel free to ask any of the question relavant to the course.

As long as you finish all the homework seriously and carefully on time and get a good mark in both the midterm and final exam, it will not be hard to get an A.<br />Be careful that homework is very important and do not miss the midterm exam if you want to get an A+(it will be impossible for you to compete with some IMO medalists or something like that with only 95% in total)",

It makes you think twice on any seemingly easy question, and think of what you actually did, instead of skipping steps all over like what I did in DSE.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a friend asking me about a limit problem and I explained to him the arithmetic rule, and the composition rule, and he don't understand. He said: What are all those rules? I didn't use those rules and I got the answer anyways. I said: You said you didn't use it because you don't know you are using it. That's why you get things wrong. You just assumes things and blindly use it (like the L'Hopital's Rule). Taking MATH 1023 really made me more careful when doing problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some contents actually overlap with MATH 2033 so if you have made your way to the end of 1023, you should have an easier time in that.

Sometimes the TA prepared some questions that he have no idea how to solve, or need to use clueless complicated stuff to solve. And he sometimes can't finish the notes.

(Almost) Every Thursday and Friday night I would be just hating my life, but finishing those questions give you that sense of satisfaction and joy (that's right) when you finally think of the trick needed, or done the question, that MATH 1003/1012/1013 would never be able to give you. Until next week and the cycle continues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to pwn this course, what are you smoking? But if you really do, you really need to spend time into not only the homework, but also the problems in Prof. Yan's notes, which would help you clear your concepts and learn some tricks, and extra exercise from other references.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think that you can overcome the homework (don't overlook their difficulty and time required!), then definitely take this course. You will not regret it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and by the way, the midterms and finals are open-notes and you can bring 2 notebooks, and you can use a calculator as well!

Anyone with reasonable math sense could handle this class. I'd recommend this course to students who like to challenge themselves and share a love for math. Even if you only get a 5 in DSE math/ M2, I guarantee that you can still perform well in this course if you work hard.",

But I can assure you that his teaching could elevate your understanding in calculus to a whole new level.<br /><br />What he focused on is DEFINITIONS! He said it many times in the lesson, 'MATHEMATICS IS ABOUT DEFINITIONS!!!!!' So instead of testing a hell ton of algebraic techniques he rather tested on how well you reason your steps. He once said it class while pointing his finger to a student, 'Your intuition tells the limit is 0, you get a 0!' I got a mark deduction because of skipping a tiny step when proving limits -.-! <br /><br />But his approach of marking really forced students to beware of the importance of definitions, which makes 1023 much more rewarding (in terms of content only) than 1013. 1023 helps students adapting uni math. Students will eventually realize how dangerous it will be to do math without understanding definitions.",

But what makes me feel bad is, this year's 1013 has a better grading than 1023 -.-!",

If you wish to take it, you will have to spend twice more time in this course than usual courses. And if you think you are really good at math in high school, you will probably change your mind after taking this course. Actually, I think this course is even more difficult than some math courses start with 2, so please think in-depth before you take this course.

Although I should note that you would have to score really high in midterm, I mean really high (for reference, I scored 97/100 in midterm).",
