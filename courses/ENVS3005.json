It seems like she doesn't know about the topics (i.e. biogeochemical cycling, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, microbes and climate change). <br />Many unnatural pauses, 'um', and only say few more sentences after reading each the slide word by word. <br />Overall, she makes things become very complicated and messy that you will not be able to know what she is saying and what main point even though watching the lecture videos for many times!!!
