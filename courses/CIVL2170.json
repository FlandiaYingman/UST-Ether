The questions will ask u the concept of shadow price, the range of feasibility for the coefficient and the solution. (Sorry for forgetting the technical terminology used in this part)<br /><br />Part2:<br /> The Final exam for this part consists of 2 sessions.<br />Session 1: (45 mins)<br />MCQ and True/False Question, these questions were directly copied from the IPRS questions done in lecture time with being allowed to open-book, the mean is close to full marks. This part contained absolutely no brainer questions that u only need to DIRECT copy from the answer since the questions appeared in the exact same order as the answer given by the professor.<br />Sessions 2: (1 hr)<br />It consisted of 4 long questions, 2 of which were the calculation of monthly deposit and instalment. The third question was the graphing of the overdraft diagram and the last question is the income statement type question.<br />Conclusion:<br />As long as u don't give up and work hard before the will be rewarded a good grade.<br /><br />My Scores:<br />Part 1 Exam: 78/100 Mean 75.7/100<br />Part 2 Exam: unknown score not given<br />Letter grade: A",

            "comment_content": "The course is divided into 2 parts.<br /><br />1. Simplex method<br />You will learn simplex method which solves an objective function (maximizing or minimizing) with several constraints (some inequalities). Dijkstra's algorithm will also be taught to solve shortest path problems.<br /><br />2. Business in Engineering<br />In this part, you will first learn some facts/backgrounds on why studying business in the first chapter, which will only be a minor component in this part of the course. Then, income statement, IRR, ERR, overdraft calculations and so on will be taught. These are the main topics. Note that the format of the income statement to be tested is simple. No categorization of expenses is needed in the exam but it may be required in assignments. <br /><br />Some lecture videos of the second part of the course were provided since some students request for them (the professor thought the videos had been recorded automatically so only half of the lectures were recorded).<br /><br />Note that the last lecture of the 2nd part of the course was very important as some questions discussed during that lecture were actually identical to those in the exam paper. There were few students attending the class, and at the same time, a number of them did not watch the lecture video of the last lecture. It significantly affected the grades of this course.<br /><br />Exams for the 2 parts are separate, which means those tested in the 1st exam will not be tested again.",
            "comment_teaching": "One fact is that there were few students attending the lectures (about 10 to 15 for the 2nd part lectures).<br />For Prof YANG’s, there may be more students attending. Personally, it is just because of the difficulty of the topic (simplex method). However, most of the voices I heard said even attending the course cannot ensure you understand that. Firstly, his accent. Secondly, his explanation way. All in all, attending lectures may function as warning you that you should also learn yourself outside classroom instead. Personally, the only thing I hate most is his voice, which can be too loud suddenly. <br /><br />For Prof ZHANG’s, since they are morning lessons, his voice and his pace can make you fall asleep easily. In my opinion, the accent of both professors may be equally difficult for local (or even international students) to understand. Yet, after 1 to 2 weeks should you be able to get used to that.<br /><br />There could be many aspects to complain about their teaching. Nevertheless, their passion in teaching and patience in explaining some questions to students should be appreciated.",
            "comment_grading": "10% assignments<br />10% quizzes (just for attendance in the 1st part of the course but not sure about the 2nd part)<br />40% exam (1st part): 1 A4 printed/hand-written cheat sheet allowed<br />40% exam (2nd part): 1 A4 printed/hand-written cheat sheet allowed<br /><br />Questions in the paper for the 1st part were similar to those in the assignments. One of the differences is that you did not need to write the entire iteration table (simplex method). We were just asked to fill in some blanks. However, the last question was really challenging. most of us just got 1-3 marks and only 1 or 2 students got over 10 marks out of 30 marks. <br /><br />As most of the questions are “easy”, the mean was quite high. Initially, the S.D. was large because there was one question about the shortest path that any wrong steps can preclude you from getting any more marks for subsequent steps for using the correct method. In the end, as there were a number of complaints, the marking scheme was revised, and most of us had our midterm grade improved.<br /><br />In the 2nd part of the course, there T/F questions (10 marks, 2 points each), filling in the blanks (20 marks, 2 marks each), as well as typical calculation questions. As mentioned, one of the calculation questions were actually nearly identical to those discussed during the last lecture, so I guess some who had watched that lecture video / attended that lecture should have got a good result (30 marks for that “identical” question). Another one of the questions was similar to one assignment questions (income statement) but the exam one was a simplified one with more hints. Also, some more different aspects were included in this question in attempt to include most of the contents in the examination scope (40 marks). The last calculation question was just the same as the one in the assignment (30 marks). It is about project cash flow/overdraft calculation. <br /><br />Notice that there should be sources for the assignments in the 1st part of the course but none for the 2nd part. For those in the 2nd part, it was allowed to work in groups of a maximum of 3 to submit one single assignment. So, you may work with the others. Also, some questions were actually chosen from the reference books (similar to worked examples / from the exercise questions). If you want to ensure a good grade, homework of the 2nd part of the course should be paid more attention since the mean should be lower than those of the 1st part of the course. <br /><br />To sum up, the exam in the 2nd part of the course should be also easy for most of us although there are one to two challenging questions. So, carefulness is the key to success in this course. One careless move losses the entire game.<br /><br />Some data:<br />1st part <br />- Overall 37.9167/50 , mean 38.0700, sd 5.6918, median 39.0833<br />(Midterm 70/100, mean 71.374, sd 13.13)<br /><br /><br />2nd part<br />- Assignment 1: ?<br />- Assignment 2: 96/100, mean 86.1, high 98 low 10<br /><br />I think I did much better in the last exam so it made me achieve an A- in the end.",

The assignments are properly designed which provide chances for us to do proper practices, though students need to revise the notes in detail for the repetitive iteration process in Simplex Method problem, Dijhastra Algorithm, duality problem etc. Overall, the topics I would say they are not difficult but need more attention on the problem statement and iteration process, one careless mistake may lead to heavy score loss in midterm exam. <br /><br />For Part II, Prof Jack Cheng has a relatively slower teaching progress, he explains the concepts clearly with the aid of some in-class problems, the notes are presented to-the-point, illustrative and clear. The only bad thing is, his Konglish which maybe annoying sometimes. <br /><br />For the tutorial part, I think they are not really important because they directly copy the content from the lecture notes and explain the completed assignments again during tutorials.

Simplex method<br />2. Shortest path<br /><br />For the Management part,<br />1. Reasons for studying Bussiness as an Engineering<br />2. Accounting<br />3. Time Value of Money<br />4.

Surely isn't because of the prof's lenient grading, which somehow magically caused me to end up with this grade, despite having a mediocre mid-term score. Yup! It is all on me.",
