        "description": "The Advanced Venture Capital (VC) Investing course is a follow-up of the FINA 5390 VCPE course, with a particular focus on early-stage venture companies. Participants will be able to experience and practice all the learned materials, particularly those related to the VC endeavors, in real-world VC settings. Participants will “invest” alongside VC practitioners as well as being guided by investing, accounting, and legal professionals on various topics such as screening prospective investee companies in a live pitch session and drafting and compiling due diligence lists, term sheets, the required closing documentations, and valuation assessments with respective professionals, in addition to presenting early-read memos to industry professionals (e.g., members of the investment committee (IC)) for deal approvals, among other topics.",
