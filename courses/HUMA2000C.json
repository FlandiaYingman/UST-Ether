        "description": "By studying and performing pieces from the historical spectrum of classical choral masterpieces, students will gain an in-depth and hands on appreciation for the history and artistry of Western music. The performance practicum and analytical skills demonstrated will bring about a deeper understanding of music as an art form. Students will both research and perform these works to gain a unique appreciation for the music. Previous musical training, albeit helpful, is NOT required.",

            "comment_teaching": "SO FUN :D<br /><br />Droscha makes you fall in love with him and music. He's very funny and lively during class, which helps a lot when we're going through particularly boring parts in choral history.<br /><br />During rehearsals, he tries his best to help all of us explore and get familiar with our voices. It's really sad that he doesn't have enough time to mentor each of us properly. I'm sure everyone in class enjoyed this course.",

Don't be afraid of exploring your voice.<br />2. Sing out loud, but you also need blend your voice with your classmates. Requires experimentation if you're new to singing.<br />3. Look confident &amp; look at your groupmates during the singing quizzes.",

Good luck :D<br /><br />2. It's good to practice outside class with your groupmates. Find someone good, stick with them &amp; ask them to teach you how to sing. I practiced once a week outside class with mine.<br /><br />3. Final is a concert, so we had 8 pieces to memorise &amp; sing well. Don't worry, they're in the singing quizzes &amp; mid-term too.<br /><br />4. Intimacy of Creativity is a 2-week-long mini-concert series where composers ask the audience to review their music. At the end of each week, they'll perform their revised piece at a concert. Spent around 8 hours for this, but it was eye-opening. It's around mid-term, so plan your time ahead :)<br /><br />5. Compulsory extra rehearsals are usually at night. We had 3 for this semester, each lasting more than 2 hours.",
