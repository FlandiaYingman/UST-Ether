        "name": "Coastal Development and Conservation at the Great Bay Area",
        "description": "The Greater Bay Area strategic development plan not only provides new opportunities for development, but also brings new challenges in coastal conservation. It is important to make balance between economic growth and environmental conservation when developing and managing coastal environments. With the rapid coastal development in the Greater Bay Area, coastal conservation plays an important role in protecting the fragile coastal environment and ecosystem. Can coastal aquaculture work together with coastal conservation? How can we apply new tools in coastal survey for better coastal monitoring and conservation? This course provides students with first hand learning experience of coastal development status and conservation measures in the Greater Bay Area (through field survey, technical visit, and case studies). Approval of the course instructor is needed for students to enroll in this course. For ENVS students only.",
