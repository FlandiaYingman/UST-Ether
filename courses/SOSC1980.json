A., &amp; Nevid, J. S. (2019). Psychology and the challenges of life: Adjustment and growth (14th ed.)，每一課都有相應既chapter(所以總共有8個chapter from textbook要讀)，而今個sem因為係online exam(網課)所以e-book既重要性特別重要(可以ctrl+F)<br /><br />除左textbook之外，其他reading都係read for fun，個人認為唔讀既問題都唔大",
            "comment_teaching": "Michelle上同既風格幾輕鬆同interactive，而且上堂成日會即場做一啲inclass polling，投票結果會用尼做之後落尼chapter既教材<br /><br />唔take attendence，但考試會考返一啲inclass polling result，而且notes會刻意有啲位置唔太完整，從而你需要上堂先識得相關既內容<br /><br />仲有每個topic都會有wrap up去答翻問題，基本上有問題佢都會答你",

After attending to this course, you can have better concept of the formation of stress, how to cope with it and the consequences of chronic stress. The sex and gender parts also impress me well. They mention about issues like gender gap, how males and females attract each other, and gender identity. There are poll, video and research given in the lecture. Polls are just for students to express their views, there is no model answer and is interesting to know how others think of the same topics with you. The polls are sometimes open-ended questions or mc questions. <br />Syllabus:<br />Research method<br />Understanding yourself<br />Everyday stress and coping<br />Health behaviors<br />Sex, gender, and sexual behavior <br />Interpersonal attraction and love<br />The challenges of the workplace<br />Interpersonal communication",

The textbook is little bit useful but if you don't have,&nbsp;&nbsp;also ok, lecture notes are already enough for understanding.<br />The two research assignments are asking students to finish questionnaires, then write around 100 words to answer the questions such as do you think the question match the purpose of the questionnaire? These two works are in p/f manner, if you pass, you can get full marks, if you fail, you still get one more chance to redo it.<br />The two after-class assignments are released after finish teaching certain chapters. You need to express your views, which is based on research. The second after class work need students to do a test, like personality test, then post the result in the hw. Finally, discuss about the test. <br />Essay is about a way to reduce stress, you need to describe, explain the solution and use scientific research to prove it. Then, you need to think of a barrier we may face when we adapt this strategy and suggestion to overcome the barrier. Lastly, you need to set up a plan or sth to explain how you adapt this way in your daily life. You need to write around 800 words.<br />Video assignment is asking you to choose a job and a city/country, describe the gender gap of this job in this place. You also need to show what difficulties you may face when you work in this industry, with some data proof. The most important part is to describe several solutions that you can prepare now to overcome the difficulties in the future. The max time limit is 5 mins 30 seconds, you don't need to make ppt, you can present a written paper to camera, you can edit the video, as long as prof can see your whole face clearly. <br /><br />I think the workload is quite acceptable because this is a summer sem, I have much more spare time. However, i think it will be little bit heavy if you enroll it in regular sem.",

I didn't expect such content will be tested and so I didn't study it for the first test. I got a pretty bad score because of it.

Also, she is willing to answer questions and even do a wrap-up session for all collected questions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the teaching pace of lecture is quite slow, since in the lecture only part of the concept will be introduced. From Michelle words &quot;the purpose of lecture is arousing your interest to read the textbook&quot;. However, I still hope that she can teach more in the lecture rather than asking us to read textbook.<br /><br />Lastly, no recording.

However, it should be less stressful in fall or spring sem<br /><br />Here are the major tasks<br /><br />1. Research exercises <br />Watching a video and write a short paragraph for summarizing the content and share your opinion. This part is pass/fail scheme so if you pass you automatically get 10%. Basically it is testing your sincerity so please don't fail it.<br /><br />2. Required reading<br />Most troublesome part (in my opinion). You need to read a few chapters (around 8) in the textbook. The major purpose is for preparing the tests as Michelle will examine a lot about the textbook. If you don't read them, your tests will very likely to be screwed up.<br /><br />However, I don't like reading and the textbook is crammed with words. As a result, the textbook offers me a realistic experience that I am experiencing headache when the textbook is introducing the concept of headache. What a good service. If you don't like reading, this part will be quite tough.<br /><br />Moreover, you need to buy (or borrow) the textbook by yourself. The latest version is 14 and Michelle will follow the latest version. Being a poor person I just search the Internet and only found version 13 freely. I found there are some differences in the two versions (ver.13 has 14 chapters only but ver.14 has 15 chapters). However, I read version 13 only and still fine =) .<br /><br />3. Assignments<br />Write two short essays (300 words each). Not very hard, but remember you need to show and apply the concept learnt in lecture but not simply talking superficial things otherwise you cannot get high marks. <br /><br />4. Tests<br />Open-book, open-notes, open-internet. &quot;Ctrl+F&quot; and Google are your best friend. <br /><br />Majority is True/False question. Therefore, good news is that you can have an expectation of 50% correct for blind guessing. However, if you want to achieve higher, you must read through all lecture slides and textbook as Michelle literally examines everything. She even asks you the result of polling conducted in class.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There will be also one short essay question is Test 2. 400 words. The format is similar to assignment.<br /><br />5. Group essay<br />First of all, universal rule for group work : Pray for no freeriders<br /><br />As the group assignment is done by prof, you can only pray for that. If this catastrophe happens unfortunately, you can only either accept your fate or put double or even triple effort to carry your teammates. <br /><br />The topic for this sem is negative emotions under covid-19 and you need to write 1600-2000 words for talking the negative emotions with coping strategies.<br /><br />There are two stages for the essay : Outline and finalized essay<br /><br />The outline is quite simple. It is only helping you brainstorming. The essay itself is not very difficult as well. If your group cooperate properly you can finish it in a few days.<br /><br />To be honest, the required readings are more troublesome than the group project in my opinion = =",

Then, according to the your own result, you have to answer 2 guiding questions and write 300 words in total. Including completing the survey, the whole assignment will take you about 40 minutes to complete. <br /><br />For the Individual Assignment 2, it is about the self. You have to first provide a drawing or a photo of how you slept when you are a baby. After that, you have to analyse your caregiver's intention based on your sleeping location (learnt during lecturers). You have to write about 300 words. This assignment will take you about 30 minutes. <br /><br />For the group project, you'll form a group of 4 by randomly. The project this time is about COVID-19. <br />For the group outline, your group have to list 4 unpleasant emotions (can overlap) occurs during COVID-19 and describe how they form. You only need to write in point form. So, the outline will take your 5 minutes to finish. Super easy. <br />For the Paper, each group member first have to rewrite what written in Outline in sentences (not point form this time) with the support of journal articles. The maximum word count for the first part is 200 words. The second part is a group work that writing a 1600-2000 words essay. This essay is simply about the coping strategies of each of the emotions mentioned in the first part. Each of the group member may have to spend about 2 hours on the whole Group Paper. <br /><br />The two tests are open-book, open-notes, or even can google.For Test 1, only topics from &quot;Introduction&quot; to &quot;Personality&quot; are tested. For Test 2, only topics from &quot;The Self&quot; to &quot;Psychology Work&quot; are tested. For both tests, you have to study both lecture notes and textbooks. Lecture notes except &quot;Romantic Love&quot; are short in length. However, the topics in textbooks has at least 30 pages. For me the heaviest workload for this course is reading textbook. It is a must to read textbooks as 50% of questions come from lecture notes and another 50% come from textbooks. It is better to start reading textbook as early as you can, and finish reading all before tests.",

I spent a lot of time in the poster and presentation, I heard many people got low marks for both of them.

Better not to focus on Michelle's note as there are not much to be tested. <br /><br />For group paper, it can cost you much time to complete. Only theme is given and you have to figure out a topic and sort of writing an argumentative essay. The reason I said it is time consuming is that you have to find psychological papers to support your argument. If you search it with your own computer, there are not many free-of-charge one so you better do it in Barn or LC? Also, I had poor performance in the paper because my arguments were too sociological not psychological. To avoid this, you should consult the TA regarding to the topic.",
