        "description": "The course focuses on the physical processes in fluid systems and their mathematical representation; includes the fundamental laws of classical mechanics and thermodynamics and how these principles are applied to fluid flow problems. The processes of waves and mixing in fluids are emphasized. The type of fluid systems to be studied varies from year to year depending on the studentsâ€™ interest and can range from natural to engineered systems including fluid based renewable energy systems.",
