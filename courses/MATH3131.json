            "comment_teaching": "*** Prof. Yongchang ZHU***<br /><br />&quot; How to test whether one knows Analysis? The answer is to test whether he knows Fourier Analysis.<br />How to test whether one knows Algebras? The answer is to test whether he knows Tensor Product.&quot;___ Prof. ZHU<br /><br />Prof. ZHU is an extremely non-trivial human, he scored highest in all aspects of his PhD qualification exams in Yale (if I remembered correctly :0). Also, Prof. Ivan IP, whose supervisor was Prof. ZHU in UG, is an extremely non-trivial neko that gave tons of happiness to year 1 students this semester. It is clear to see how non-trivial Prof. ZHU is so let's denote Prof. ZHU by non-trivial human. (just kidding :P)<br /><br />Non-trivial human's teaching pace increases exponentially with time. This is my feeling about 3131:<br /><br />Group Theory: This is an Algebra course for Babies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )<br />Ring Theory: This is a standard undergraduate Algebra course (≖͞_≖̥)<br />Module Theory: Any % speedrun 5111 (இωஇ)<br /><br />Roughly speaking, the teaching style of non-trivial human is between FF and Ivan. Non-trivial human has a gradual teaching pace with motivations and examples so you can catch up with the lectures easily. Also, non-trivial human likes to give proof sketches and let us fill in the details after class. One thing that I am impressed by non-trivial human is that his teaching notes is basically some important lemmas and theorems without proof while he can present the ideas and proofs in an organized way throughout this course...extremely non-trivial Orz.<br /><br />In class, non-trivial human like to interact with students (but most of us were shy anyway (///ω///)). One of my unforgettable memories in class is that somehow non-trivial human didn't know how to prove Chinese Remainder Theorem, and he just picks somebody to present the proof in front of the whole class, and that guy is me =͟͟͞͞(꒪ᗜ꒪ ‧̣̥̇) 劇烈害怕.jpg. Perhaps the most effective way to check whether you understand the proof is to present the proof in front of non-trivial human. (✘_✘)<br /><br /><br />*** Our TA, Jeff York YE ***<br /><br />We have the same TA as 2043, 3043. If you don't know how non-trivial he is, let me show you a dialogue in class before introducing this TA :)<br /><br />ZHU: &quot;If you wish to continue the PhD study, then you should be better than the best student in 5000-level courses&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />(Whole class Laugh)<br />ZHU: &quot;No, better than Jeff is IMPOSSIBLE​! Jeff is the best student in recent 10 years, or probably 20 years...&quot;<br /><br />Same as the 2043, 3043 review, I have to emphasize that he is an extremely non-trivial GENIUS. Personally, Jeff's 3131 tutorial problems are easier than that of 2043 and 3043 because you can at least understand what's the problem asking for before attending his tutorials (✘_✘)??? Tutorial problems are still very difficult and some problems are related to other fields like Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Number Theory. I think it is good to give you a taste of other fields that are related to algebra so that you won't suffer from Ivan IP's UROP/ SCIE like me after knowing how disgusting algebra is (-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩_-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩).<br /><br />There are some easier problems in Jeff's tutorials that you should be able to finish it after revision. And I also encourage you to read the solution of some advanced problems cuz some of them are classical and you will see them in 5111 for sure :D. If you can understand the solution to tutorial problems and master the idea of each proof, I am pretty sure, or 120% sure that this course will be an easy A for you.<br /><br />Btw, Jeff is the most effective TA that I have ever seen. He usually grades our homework within 1 day and he graded our paper within 1.5 hours after the final exam (surprise!!! Σ(ŎдŎ|||)ﾉﾉ).<br /><br />***Important***<br />NEVER try to give fake proofs in homework or exam if you dk how to do it...it doesn't work...by my past experience in 2043 and 3043...(˃ ⌑ ˂ഃ ).<br />***Important***",

You need to present your solution very well to get full credits and prof. ZHU cares about every single detail in your proof. Personally, Prof. ZHU deducted &gt;10 pts in my final cuz my statement is not clear enough though my idea is totally correct. Also no partial credit for any incomplete proof so it is quite common to lose more than 10 points in a 15 points problem.<br /><br />This is a fruitful (and non-trivial :P) course with lenient grading, unlike some ¥¥¥ prof. ¥¥¥ whose office sits near room 3488 ┴┴︵╰（‵□′）╯︵┴┴ ...<br /><br />***Disclaimer***<br />I haven't mentioned who are he/she, maybe that professor is Ivan IP (which also teach 2131)​ (￣y▽￣)<br />***Disclaimer***<br /><br />EXTRA:<br />btw, you are not recommended to argue with prof. ZHU for your exams scores...Because...urr...Probably Prof. ZHU will let you realize how trivial you are instead.<br />( ‘-ωก̀ )",
            "comment_workload": "We have a total of 7 Homework through this course but only 5~6 problems in total are difficult. Homework doesn't contribute to my workload pretty much in the course. The major workload is reading proofs shown in lectures. It is extremely important to master and memorize those proofs cuz I think that the tricks for solving Algebras problems are similar sometimes.<br /><br />Also I spent time in construct examples and counter-examples. eg:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Find Group G and Subgroup N, M s.t. N ◃M ◃G but N ◃G<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Find a subgroup of G×G s.t. it cannot be written as N×M where N, M are subgroups of G<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Give an example of E.D. but not field, P.I.D. but not E.D., U.F.D. but not P.I.D., ...etc.<br />It is crucial to construct examples yourself in an algebra course since solving algebra problems is highly rely on your instinct and past experience personally. It is quite important to build up a sense for algebra by consistent practice.<br /><br />good luck :)",

Of course, it would be a torture if one have to learn them in a rush.<br /><br />Professor follows the book contents closely so self-studying the contents should be ok. However, Artin's book is dense and not too easy to understand as pointed out in other reviews. I finally understand the contents by slowing down my pace and re-reading the contents.

Finding the related contents in the book is enough to solve most of the problems. Since the exam time is only 1.5 hour, time constraint is more of a problem.<br /><br />P.S.

He is very nice though, and he will answer questions after class (assume that you have any)<br /><br />Professor love not using the standard notation for things. For example, the notation for normal subgroup (the triangle thing), S_n, D_n, A_n, and so on, are NOT used, making self study kind of difficult, especially when the recommended reference, Artin, uses those notation just fine.<br /><br />The TA usually put up difficult questions and he talks fast.

Most of the time, he just brings up a topic, goes &quot;oh this idea is interesting&quot;, then he laughs to himself and moves on without even explaining much.<br /><br />Then he would open a pdf of the book to see &quot;what he missed&quot; (spoiler alert: a whole lot of stuff, since he basically just skims through everything), then he would go and hover his mouse over some text while talking in a monotonous voice for 20 minutes. not exactly the most engaging way to learn.<br /><br />There were times when he would say &quot;oh this thing is important you can read it yourself in the book&quot;. Man, if it's important you should really be teaching it instead of telling us to read it ourselves. He would sometimes also say that if a proof if &quot;more than 5 lines&quot;, then it's too long to discuss in class and that we should read it ourselves.<br /><br />It's also not uncommon for him to finish blabbering around 30 minutes early, then he just goes and asks us if we have any questions. seriously? you barely discussed anything, and now class is done? &quot;Funny thing is, that when we did ask question about the homework, it would be as if he had never seen the question before (I think he had not), and there are times where he spend 20 minutes thinking about the question to no avail (then ask us to go home and think about it).&quot; (quote from MATH 5111 review. go check it out.

It is a standard textbook with various concrete rigorous examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, it seems that most of the professors use Artin's book. However I don't like it because of the style of storytelling and the examples inside. <br /><br />Other recommended material is Ivan Ip's MATH5111 notes. It is basically this years MATH3131, plus category theory, field theory and Galois theory, so Ivan's note is a good summary on MATH3131 basically. <br /><br />Prerequisite: It seems that (theoretically) there are not many strict prerequistes for learning abstract algebra. However, I recommend future students having some background knowledge to the following:<br /><br />1. Discrete mathematics. In fact one purpose of group and ring theory is to solve number theory and combinatorial problems. In previous year of COMP2711H, there is content related to group, ring and field theory. <br />2. Linear algebra. The module theory is basically a generalization of linear algebra.<br /><br />The course is divided as follows:<br /><br />1. Group theory<br /><br />-&gt; Definition of groups<br />-&gt; Discussion of symmetric group<br />-&gt; Homomorphism and isomorphism <br />-&gt; Group action <br />-&gt; Subgroup, Lagrange theorem<br />-&gt; Coset and quotient group<br />-&gt; Isomorphism theorems<br />-&gt; Caylet theorem, Sylow theorem, classification of abelian group...<br /><br />2. Ring theory<br /><br />-&gt; Definition of rings<br />-&gt; Advanced definitions: Integral domain, field, polynomial ring, ideals, PID, ED, UFD, Noetherian ring...<br />-&gt; Chinese remainder theorem in terms of ideal<br /><br />3. Module theory<br /><br />-&gt; Definition of module<br />-&gt; Direct sum<br />-&gt; Free module<br />-&gt; Construction of tensor product<br />-&gt; Exact sequence<br />-&gt; Vector space and linear algebra over field<br />-&gt; Tensor algebra, symmetric algebra, exterior algebra",

Sophisticated: The instructor is an expert on algebra, so he is able to teach with very fast pace and keep a rigorous treatment of the content. As an expert of Lie group theory, he sometimes tells the relation between measure theory/ real analysis and abstract algebra. As an analysis student, I'm quite enjoyable with such linkage between analysis and other topics.<br /><br />2. (For tutorial) The tutor makes high quality questions for tutorial. If the difficulty of exams is &quot;easy to moderate&quot;, the homework questions are &quot;moderate to difficult&quot;, then I will describe the tutorial problems as &quot;moderate to extremely difficult&quot;. The tutorial of this course has successfully done what it should give to the students.<br /><br />Room for improvement:<br /><br />1. The instructor always come to the class late. Usually he is late for around 5 minutes. An extreme case is that in the last lecture he come to the class late for almost 45 minutes... So I cannot give it an A for the teaching part. <br /><br />2. Sometimes he made minor mistakes, like writing the derivative of x^5 to be 4x^4 (in the first lecture).<br /><br />Remark: The TA is super effective. After I finished the exam and get back home around 1.5 hours later, I received my final exam score. It's somewhat terrible.",
