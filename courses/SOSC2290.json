There are a midterm, a group project and a final.<br /><br />There are 10% participation, you need to ask questions in class and the TA will write down your name. <br /><br />Midterm is MC. But it is really difficult. It covers the reading materials and PPTs. Reading materials are too many(usually 20-70 pages after EVERY class!!), so it's hard for you to read all of them. But the exam covers every details in them, like &quot;which one is not the perspective that xxx holds&quot;. Plus, you must memorize the PPT carefully，many MCs are completely the same with the ppt pages. The mean is low and I got the mean grade--43/100<br /><br />The group project is also really hard. The group of 5-6 people&nbsp;&nbsp;need to submit 12-15 pages paper and take a presentation in front of the class. The topic must relates to China study. <br /><br />Final contains 2 short essays. There are 4-6 questions in one big topic and the prof only give us 1 hour to complete two topics. The topics are more difficult than the topics he taught in class. If you listen to him carefully and read all the materials, you may feel a little bit relieved. Otherwise, you can write nothing but bullshit.<br /><br />I don't know my grades of group project and final. I got a&nbsp;&nbsp;C finally. But I devoted most of my time in studying this course. Most of my group mates got C, their midterm grades all higher than the mean.",

Certainly not the most invigorating class. He prompts students to ask him questions for further class discussions, and his answers to student's questions are elaborate but insightful.<br /><br />You can certainly skip lectures and simply read off lecture materials to pass the course, but some slides are missing details which he answers in class. A lot of data and charts that are quite meaningless for the exam. Lectures are broadcasted on Zoom, but are not recorded, so do not expect yourself to come back and re-watch lectures later on.",

The longest reading contains almost 50 pages (around 20000 words). <br /><br />We have an open-book exam in this course, we need to answer 2 questions in 2 hours. However, it requires to cite the sources from the internet if we need to use them. I do not have enough time to answer 2 questions because the time is really insufficient.<br /><br />The format of answering one question is like that: &quot;You only need to write a few paragraphs to answer one question. In the first paragraph, briefly introduce your arguments. Then use roughly three paragraphs to develop your arguments and use evidence (qualitative or quantitative) to support your arguments. You’d better use at least one paragraph to address counter-arguments or alternative explanations. In the end, summarize your arguments and draw a conclusion.&quot;",

Ironically, the midterms and finals were mostly about the examples that he spoke in class, and if you miss a part or you can't understand of example, you're doomed in exams. <br />Moreover, don't be late for class, as you're gonna be scolded by him and he will keep questioning you why are you late (which implies that our lectures were always being distracted and lost focused lol)",

However, I guess my group paper was quite well written, so my grade turns out was not bad, the grade was in b range at last. For the final exam, owing to the political circumstances, it was changed to a 1-hour exam with three questions, you just have to pick two of them. <br /><br />Another important thing is that there are 10% of participation mark for this course, you will receive some marks if you give out some meaningful questions, but I didn't ask any questions, so my mark for this part is zero.<br /><br />Mark distribution:<br />Midterm exam (25%); <br />Final exam (35%); <br />Group project (30%); <br />Class participation (10%)",

To get the participation scores, you have to familiarize yourself with the powerpoint slides and readings. <br /><br />If you would just like to get average grades, you just need to revise one day before the midterm and final exam. Also, finish the group paper with your peers and make a good presentation (the presentation was canceled due to the cancellation of classes ).",
