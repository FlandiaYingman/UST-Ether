Sometimes he may not hv time to go through the whole ppt and you may need to guess what the examples mean and which examples fit which argument etc but generally its quite clear. <br />Easy to follow if you watch his lecture and understand the key points (eg threshold of participation, bandwagon effect)<br />There may be a lot of other examples that are not well explained in the readings but understanding the arguments are enough as you can use the examples from the lecture for exams.",

            "comment_workload": "- Email questions about the readings weekly to the ta for participation marks.<br />- Midterm and final exams in essay format.<br />- Research essay in at least 7 pages single spaced. Can be done individually or in groups of two. Have to decide your own topic and do some research about it using secondary data like news, telegram, twitter etc. It was the most difficult part throughout the sem but it was still manageable. Although you can choose your own social protest/movement, i would recommend choosing collective actions happened in hk as it is easier to collect data. Then find a controversial issue that you wanna talk about and draft it into a specific question. Although there were not guidelines, the general format was similar to the real research paper. He did not expect us to develop some new theories so the literature review part could be just referring to the theories taught in readings that helped explain your thesis/arguments, but I guess he preferred us spending some time to collect secondary data as it is a research not an argumentative essay. <br />The prof is very nice and willing to hold consultation sessions upon request.",
