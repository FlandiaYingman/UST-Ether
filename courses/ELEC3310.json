But it is relatively easy comparing to other 3000/4000-level courses I took (elec3100, elec3300, elec3400, elec 4320), even easier than some 2000-level courses like elec 2100.<br /><br />But if you are a beginner who is interested at hardware and the deep working principle of digital hardware like cpu, gpu, various chips, etc., this is a fundamental and good course for you. It can't give you deeper knowledge, but it is a good start and necessary. <br /><br />I think this course should be an unofficial requirement for elec2350. You should take this course before taking elec2350.<br /><br />If you have already learnt digital circuit and are good at it, this course can help you to revise and give you very good grade.<br /><br />I studied a course from Coursera before taking this course. That course is quite similar to this course. If you passed that course, elec3310 will be easy for you. You can try if you are interested:<br />https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital-systems",

Also, you need to understand the related concepts in the lecture notes. <br /><br />HW only has very few questions (1-3) which you must be able to finish if you understand the lecture notes.<br /><br />mini project is just lab8. but instead, they won't guide you to do.

            "comment_teaching": "Although I mention the course not being hard, professor explain almost every single concept to you in the lecture, which makes the course a little bit boring when you understand how it works.<br /><br />Tutorials are all about labs and the mini project. The labs are about VHDL coding, which is about programming a Basys 3 board. The progress and the result is different compared with software programming like C++ and&nbsp;&nbsp;Python, etc. But the coding part is easy if you already complete COMP2011 or something similar.",
            "comment_grading": "As you have to finish the lab and project to get pass, you always get full marks on that.<br /><br />Homework does not count in course grade under usual situation, but I still recommend you to finish all if you are not that busy. Because the same question may appears in mid term and final exam (For me, yes).<br /><br />However, getting high marks on mid term and final exam is difficult. As everyone perform pretty well, you have to pay much more attention on how to design the logical circuit and how to make it works. Deep understanding on each components is a must to get A or B+, for example like different kinds of flip-flop(D ,JK, T), Multiplexer, Decoder. Finishing homework can practice your brain on transforming different parts using gates.<br /><br />Finally, there is course participation marks on course grading. According to the professor, the most easier method to get all participation marks is to attend the lecture, answer questions and ask as much as you can. Make the professor remember you.<br /><br />mid: 25%, final: 25%, lab and project: 40%, Hw: 0%(usually), course participation: 10%",
            "comment_workload": "There are 7 labs and 1 mini project (all in pair of 2) need to do in the whole course. You must finish all to pass the course. But there are skeleton code for you and the remaining part is piece of cake if you attend the tutorial or have knowledge on how to software programming. I think the most difficult part of lab is to installing Vivado (the software to finish the labs), for student this semester. We have to write Email to AMD to get the permission to install.<br /><br />Total 5 homework, but it does not count in the grade if you work fine in this course. Homework will help when you fail on mid term and final exam marks. You will get pass (the course grade) if you are almost fail but with all homework done.",
