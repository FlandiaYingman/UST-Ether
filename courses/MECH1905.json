The content from this course is so shit and stupid I actually want to die.<br /><br />The PPT slides are just walls of text, and the exams and quizzes test every tiny fact from the slides, so if you like memorizing PPT slides you will love this course!<br /><br />Also there is like 2 huge chapters that isnt even about buildings - VR and microsensors. <br /><br />The shit he teaches is like a middle school presentation. (stupid topic, terrible organization, poor communication, and zero effort) <br /><br />At the end of the course, he tries to bribe the students by giving a free ebook/audiobook that you can find on google",

But yet I feel I have learnt nothing about it. <br /><br />He always just plays youtube videos during lectures. I dont mind the videos, but they are all useless - for 3 lectures straight, he just played advertisements for Alexa and other dumb products.<br /><br /><br />In lectures after midterm, he name-called people who got low scores... he is evil and cold-blooded with no concern for student's well-being.<br /><br /><br />also he is a real bitch about camera policy",

You can even find him whenever you are free to chat with him with the things that are not even related to the course. He is more like a Secondary teacher than a lecturer so you are expecting him to be a little bit different from standard lecturer. For example, he would require the students who attend the lessons not to eat or chat in the class. So you may have to behave yourself if you attend his class.<br />However, in the lecture, he would not provide much information outside of the lecture notes. So you may find it boring to attend his lessons",

The calculation is almost the same as the calculations done in the assignments. So this part of score is a must-get score. The short questions are the materials from the lecture notes. They can be recited easily if you can find the pattern. The grading is also great. I got an A+ in return of simple revision.",

You can do it if you don't have such background by searching inside the lecture notes. You may have to notice the deadlines of assignment.

We were given 20 or 30 smth topics to choose from, and maybe choose the one that you know the most or at least passionate abt since the topics could completely be unrelated to the course materials and you have to do a lot of research by yourself. In the end, we were told to write a 10+ page report and present it using ppt. There will be one or two progress checking to see how your team was doing by submitting a tentative report. A day or two before final submission, the instruction of the report's format changed and so some adjustments needed to be made which was annoying",

The attendance part is just to FORCE you to TURN ON YOUR CAMERA during each lecture (however boring the content sounds like) so as not to lose marks here.

As for the short questions, although it was told listing the points with explanation was enough, they were unpredictable. For instance, one question asked about the constituent compounds of natural gas without asking for explanation. <br /><br />Structure of the exam paper is just similar to the midterm paper, except having a double of the number of questions. What's more, one short question required more than explanation in words but also a diagram. As for the calculation questions, although it was told that they were very similar to the assignments, in fact, ALL OF THE THEM in the exam paper are DIFFERENT from those in assignments. Concepts or ideas of those questions in the paper may be included in the lecture slides instead. Some of them may confused us as their situations were similar to examples shown in the slides but the ideas or concepts were totally unrelated. They were taught in DSE physics lessons instead, like mgh = 0.5 mv^2 (conversion of PE to KE).<br /><br />In short, it is encouraged not to trust in professors. <br /><br />Additionally, should you find anything ambiguous in the papers, just ask the TA or professors. They may then explain to you, although Moses may actually want to blame you for not reading the questions carefully...<br /><br />Regarding my performance:<br />Assignment 1: 19/25<br />Assignment 2 - 5: 25/25<br />Midterm: 51/100 (below ~1sd)<br />Final: ?<br />Grade: B+ (It seems that I have got a pretty high score in the final exam. It may be so lucky that I have studied physics in college.)",

Questions are not hard. <br /><br />The workload before midterm and final exam may be high as you are going to copy all important stuffs in the slides to merely 2 sheets of A4 paper, and most of the stuffs are potentially important owing to unpredictability.",
