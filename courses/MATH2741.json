Moreover, geometric constructions will be associated with algebraic fields of numbers and hence related to various famous constructability problems. Topics covered by the course include Euclidean constructions, compass-only constructions, straightedge-only constructions, constructability, three classical problems and regular polygons.",

            "comment_teaching": "這課程十分依靠Canvas及自己的小組進行教學。我是逢星期一、三上課。每星期先預習下星期的課 (有影片及文字資料)，星期一老師會講一些難的部分，你可以聽或不聽，一邊自己做練習 (不很難，大多不用很多步驟就能畫到了，死線幾乎不用趕)，不懂就問旁邊的人。星期三幾乎每星期都有堂課，兩三條問題，和組員 (上限是四人一組) 討論一下就好了。匯報是不用自己有什麼工作成果的，只是在網上找一下資料然後告訴同學就好。就像有兩堂是同學在教書那樣。因為平常都見到組員上課，有一點交流，做起工作來也很順利。較要求自主學習的一科。老師們都是很善良的人，教得好不好我見各人有各人看法 (而且老師講課的時間不很多)，可能只是你與他們的教學方法合不合你而已。",

            "comment_content": "A course to study what kinds of figures we can draw using tools as simple as straightedge (i.e. unmarked ruler) and/or compass. In Chinese, the course is about &quot;尺規作圖&quot;.<br /><br />Brief Outline:<br />- Brief History of Geometry, Euclidean Constructions<br />- Constructability, Three Classical Problems<br />- Compass-only Constructions, Mohr-Mascheroni Theorem<br />- Straightedge-only Constructions, Poncelet-Steiner Theorem<br />- Regular Polygons, Theory of Constructible Regular Polygons (most crucial part for the course)<br /><br />Some very basic concepts in Abstract Algebra, Complex Numbers and Number Theory will be mentioned. But anyway they will assume we have no prior knowledge on these terms and will start everything from scratch, so no need to worry too much. <br />(If you study well you will be able to solve z³=1 XD)<br /><br />There is also a presentation in week 5, in which all students will form groups of 2 (can choose partner, so if you don't want to be randomly assigned to someone you don't know you may try to persuade a friend to enroll and study with you XD) and each group will use one week to prepare for a 8 minute collaborative presentation on a prescribed topic (e.g. introduce the method and principle of a specific tool that can be used to solve the three classical problems), then transfer the content of presentation into a formal written report.<br /><br />A midterm exam was held on week 8 before Mohr-Mascheroni Theorem, and a final exam on the end of semester. Both exams are &quot;open-canvas&quot; but &quot;close-elsewhere&quot;.<br /><br />As far as what I observed, the number of enrollments for this course is not very high for several years, probably because this course is neither a common core, nor a requirement for all math tracks (having said that, this course can be used as an elective for General Math Track or Math Minor), thus their study paths are likely to be occupied by many other core courses. Insufficient course reviews might also be a factor. However, in my opinion, the content itself is quite interesting and I can really learn something different from usual computational math courses.<br /><br />Moreover, I think this course is irrelavant with calculus but don't know why they need us to pass MATH1014. People can start this course as long as they are good with high school geometry knowledge, like coordinates, sine law and cosine law, similar triangles, equation of circles, &quot;diagonals of rhombus are perpendicular to each other&quot; etc. Math department should somehow consider replacing the MATH1013/MATH1014 pre-requisite by &quot;Level 5 or above in HKDSE Math (Compulsory Part)&quot; or something like that to encourage potential-in-math freshmen to join this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "As the course is delivered in Blended Learning Mode, most of the contents are learnt by ourselves. In general, course materials for next week will be released on each Saturday. Dr KU will use the Monday Lecture as a briefing on the materials, as well as Q&amp;A for last week's materials, and the Friday Lecture to release and go through some additional in-class exercises, as well as Q&amp;A. When necessary, i.e. when he thinks the materials are not that easy to understand, he will spend some time in the lecture to explain the concepts involved. His English is good and the teaching pace is slow.<br /><br />You may choose to skip the lectures if you want to get extra hours do manage other courses. As far as I can remember, usually only less than half of the class attended the lectures. However, Dr KU appreciates more interaction and feedback from students so I would suggest to engage more in lectures.",

            "comment_workload": "Light and uniform throughout the semester, and could be a little bit busy during the presentation preparation week and during the last two weeks.<br /><br />We have online exercises every week containing hands-on construction problems, explanations, informal proofs, T/F or MC questions etc. Seems a lot but each question is not hard. I would interpret them as several step-by-step worksheets, we worked out the answers by ourselves and learn from them. I spent around 1.5 hours (outside class) for completing the exercises on each week. Nevertheless, as the due date for each week's exercise is set on next week (Monday for the main topic and Wednesday for the in-class exercises), you have plenty of time to complete the exercises. Just beware of T/F or MC questions since you can answer only once, and that's why I lose 0.5 point in &quot;Online Exercises&quot; part.<br /><br />For presentation week, we might need to spend more time to do research or rehearsal or report etc., but the workload increment is not that significant, since no new materials will be released during preparation week and presentation week. <br />The course materials in last two weeks (i.e. starting from regular polygons) are relatively more difficult and hence might need more time to digest. <br /><br />If you did all exercises by yourself and understands the principles behind, you should be able do the exams well, don't need to spend too much time on revision.<br /><br />Overall, in my opinion, lighter than most of the 2000-level Math courses, slightly heavier than COMP2711.",
