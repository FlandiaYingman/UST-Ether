        "description": "This course provides an overview of quantitative methods used for design and analysis of construction operations to maximize productivity and resource utilization through Discrete Event Simulation (DES), System Dynamics (SD), Agent Based Simulation (ABS), and Building Information Modelling (BIM). This course is intended to equip students with an understanding of the roles of simulation techniques in practice and research and introduce state-of-the-art simulation techniques for construction simulation and management. The course includes a combination of lectures, assigned readings, quizzes, a series of weekly individual assignments, and a class project (term project) for modelling and analysing actual construction operations. The lectures aim to provide the students fundamental concepts and principles of advanced simulation technologies to solve construction problems. Assigned readings from literature will guide students to better understand the discussed material through active learning approach. Assignments will improve the problem-solving skills for students. Students will be asked to complete a term project on their topic of interest.",
