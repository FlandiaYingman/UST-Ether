        "name": "Introduction to Modeling & Simulation of Complex and Multi-Disciplinary Dynamical Systems",
        "description": "Many complex systems found in nature/society and studied by social/economical/physical scientists (e.g. the human cardiovascular system, the brain neural network, biological systems, the geophysical network of oil/water/gas reservoirs, social networks), or developed by engineers (e.g. labs on chips, iPads, magnetic resonance scanners, nationwide electrical/gas/oil transportation network, supply chains, currency/stock markets, buildings/automotive/aircraft frames) can be viewed as large collections of interconnected dynamical system components. The goal of this course is to provide students with a working hands-on knowledge of the state of the art in modeling, simulation, model order reduction and uncertainty quantification techniques for these types of systems. The focus of the course will not be on mathematical formalism and rigorous theorem proving, but rather on developing general intuition, creativity, practical implementation and model debugging skills. Students will work in small teams on a course-long project involving modeling and simulation of a complex system chosen either from their own research or from the examples presented in class.",
