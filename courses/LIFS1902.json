Comparing to the previous content, the complexity was like an abrupt turn.<br /><br />The concepts of topics he taught were very very challenging, remarkably hard to understand and too many to be memorized. If you can't understand the concept there is no way you know his questions in the exam.<br /><br />His teaching is intriguing, he will ask many questions related to the content and allow the student to think.

He's also keen to answer the students' questions during or after the lecture.<br /><br />**Some tips: He really loves the details in his ppt slides. Make sure to memorize minor things in his ppt even it doesn't seem to be related to biology.**<br /><br />Professor Li<br />: The chapters that she's in charge of requires a fairly large amount of memorization. Her teaching is good enough for understanding the concepts but sometimes the lecture pace is so fast. (maybe due to a lot of contents to cover in a limited time span)<br /><br />**Some tips: Don't try to memorize everything in her ppt slides. Only focus on the things she mentions during the lecture.**<br /><br />Professor Liang<br />: Professor Liang sometimes questions about why a certain phenomenon is happening and why should it work in that way during the lecture. He gives students some time to answer his questions. These questions can be critical for understanding the concepts in his part. Make sure to know what is the right answer to the question.<br /><br />All three professors have different teaching styles. It would be good for your study to know their teaching styles and respond to their style properly each time the professor changes.",

There was new content not covered in IB Bio, but they are not complicated. WARNING: Miller has a whole lecture on psychology/pschoanalysis and lots of seemingly unrelated info on Nobel prizes/random facts. GET THAT RANDOM INFO DOWN. Being fluent in English helps immensely with this. If you are not fluent in English, you will need to memorize these facts. Fortunately, Miller's ppt's are comprehensive and required little additional notes. Miller's pace is also slower than the other two profs, which is good for learning but he doesn't finish planned content. He only tests on taught content, so no worries. <br />Miller also has a strong sense of humor that some <br /> absolutely love and others find unbearably distracting. I loved it. <br /><br />LI:<br /> Her ppts includes a lot of images and diagrams, but lack words. I had to rewatch lecture videos and type out notes. Li's sentences don't flow as smoothly as Miller's (I suppose because she has less experience). This is not a problem during lessons, but becomes one when having to type out notes. Rewatching lecture and typing out notes was very frustrating and unnecessarily time-consuming, especially since typing out all key points during lectures is practically impossible. However, Li is very kind and willing to answer students questions. <br /><br />LIANG<br />Clear passion and difficult content. His ppts contain a good amount of content, but not everything, so rewatching and typing out notes is definitely needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the content very difficult in comparison with Miller's and Li's, however (I imagine) it is the basis of the rest of the biology classes. Liang also includes brief Chinese/Cantonese idioms/sayings to explain certain things. It's just an extra and does not (at least from what I see) affect the understanding of non-Chinese speakers. Despite how much I like Liang's teaching, I found studying his content an absolute pain",

And the contents of his lecture sticks to the syllabus/book<br /><br />Liang:<br />His part is the hardest (dna)( so be prepared by the hard Qs in the exam), so u will need more time to prepare and understand his parts, his ppt is very organised and separated different parts with colour. He will include more extra information apart from the lecture, and u should prepare that in exam, but if the extra content is really out of syllabus, he will tell u that part is not required in the exam. And his exam Q is tricky and not as straight forward as miller's and raymond's.<br /><br />Raymond:<br />He talks very slowly in class and he always can't finish the slides in the lectures (bear in mind that he has retired and is just helping some parts of the course).

There was new content not covered in IB Bio, but they are not complicated. WARNING: Miller has a whole lecture on psychology/pschoanalysis and lots of seemingly unrelated info on Nobel prizes/random facts. GET THAT RANDOM INFO DOWN. Being fluent in English helps immensely with this. If you are not fluent in English, you will need to memorize these facts. Fortunately, Miller's ppt's are comprehensive and required little additional notes. Miller's pace is also slower than the other two profs, which is good for learning but he doesn't finish planned content. He only tests on taught content, so no worries.<br />Miller also has a strong sense of humor that some<br />absolutely love and others find unbearably distracting. I loved it.<br /><br />LI:<br />Her ppts includes a lot of images and diagrams, but lack words. I had to rewatch lecture videos and type out notes. Li's sentences don't flow as smoothly as Miller's (I suppose because she has less experience). This is not a problem during lessons, but becomes one when having to type out notes. Rewatching lecture and typing out notes was very frustrating and unnecessarily time-consuming, especially since typing out all key points during lectures is practically impossible. However, Li is very kind and willing to answer students questions.<br /><br />LIANG<br />Clear passion and difficult content. His ppts contain a good amount of content, but not everything, so rewatching and typing out notes is definitely needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the content very difficult in comparison with Miller's and Li's, however (I imagine) it is the basis of the rest of the biology classes. Liang also includes brief Chinese/Cantonese idioms/sayings to explain certain things. It's just an extra and does not (at least from what I see) affect the understanding of non-Chinese speakers. Despite how much I like Liang's teaching, I found studying his content an absolute pain",

It goes from physiology to DNA and inheritance. I don't think it is the typical order of learning Biology but there's nothing else to do rather than accept it. The part taught by Prof MILLER and LI is basic physiology. Part of the contents taught by Prof. LIANG overlaps with the contents in senior high (mainland)(It's like the English version of it, but of course a little more in-depth). The vocabulary may be larger compared with other subjects, but it is acceptable once you get familiar with the prefixes and word roots, etc.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. MILLER is kind and just like your grandpa. His lectures are engaging and interesting. But his slides is a bit unorganized and he taught about lots of 'useless' and 'unnecessary' staff like the people winning Nobel Prize etc. The lecture on Nerves is totally transformed into psychiatry, about Freud and other mental illnesses. HOWEVER those seemingly 'useless' staff will appear in your midterm exam(even the female writer that wrote against Freud). So try to remember everything covered.<br /><br />Prof. LI is young and seems to be new in teaching. Her class is not so engaging as her tones seldom rise or drop and she seems to be not so familiar with the content. But her ppts are neat, and the structure is very clear. There are many pictures on her ppt, which are important for having a good understanding of the stuff she is talking about. Pictures didn't occur in the exams but you'd better study and memorize them. In my opinion, her exam questions are not so straightforward as prof. MILLER and is more challenging. It's easy to get confused.<br /><br />Prof. LIANG's accent is a little strange but it doesn't affect understanding. He usually raises some questions for students to think about. The questions are worth thinking. Sometimes he gives the answer, but sometimes he didn't state it quite clearly either. It greatly improves my ability to search for relative materials to find reasonable explanations. Some of the questions may appear in the test. His ppts are just fine.",

But he is still patient and willing to answer our questions. <br /><br />I like Dr. Li the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a very young woman that she explained the concept clearly and allow us to ask questions in the midway of the lessons. Her lecture notes included many diagrams and structures that were hard to memorize. Some minor concepts were missed. She also provided a chance for students to talk to her face-to-face after the exam if they have any difficulties. <br /><br />As Prof. Liang comes from Mainland China, he has a strong accent in English.

She makes some jokes and gives you a break during lecture. However, what I do not like is her terrible powerpoints; she just copies photos from getty images and shutterstock and leaves a line of description. The point is that there are tons of useless content within those photos and you need to work hard to differentiate what is useless and what is not. So the best thing to do is to attend every of her lessons.<br /><br />Liang's lecture is not really brilliant. His lecture is the most difficult one to be understood. It is understandable because the topics he is in charge is the most difficult one. However, his powerpoints are more organized than Li Laam's.

Choosing a person with no friends aside have a higher chance of success than choosing a group of people. That's because those group of people are usually met in ocamp, and they will bond with themselves so well that you can't even engage in their conversations, then you will just awkwardly sitting next to them after saying hi.<br />I found my friends when asking professors questions.<br /><br />Kind reminders, don't focus on understanding the details , this is just a introductory course , those details will probably be taught in other courses<br /><br />I think skipping lessons are fine, if you can do self learning<br />I didn't even watch those recorded videos after suspension of classes (starting from 6/11/2019 ) <br /><br />Gosh ! can't go to ust and have lessons for the entire year!

(His ppts are different from the ones he posted on canvas but he will upload the full version before exam) Also, he teaches fast. Somehow it is hard to catch up for me.<br /><br />Raymond’s teaching pace is slower than the other two, he loves to share his research results to us. Regarding his teaching, his ppt is quite confusing because he just copies the slides from google and insert them into his ppt without clear organization. Again, make sure you attend his lectures if you want to understand what is going on.<br /><br />Liang chun is responsible for teaching us the DNA and biotechnology parts, he loves to ask students questions during classes (but it’s not relate to the exam). His ppt is easy to be followed, but some of the details he will not include in his ppt (which will be examined), make sure you jot notes during his lectures.<br /><br />Luckily, the videos will be posted on canvas so it is a good new for those who do not attend lectures.",

It could help you cover all the trivial matters quickly.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Miller: I think he is the better lecturer of this course this semester. He goes through concepts really clearly and reminds us of the main points of his content frequently. Just follows what he asks you to remember is good enough to deal with his questions.<br /><br />Professor Wong: Not so good compared with other lecturers. I fell asleep several times when I am having his lectures. Probably because of his word pace is too slow. Maybe the best part is that he never finishes his ppt. Less content for revision. Also, he frequently gets off-tracked by himself and repeats what he has mentioned before.<br /><br />Professor Tang: A really kind-hearted lecturer. She holds tutorials for us, which is good. She goes through all the things smoothly but sometimes pretty boring.<br /><br />Professor Ho: Just has one lecture. No comment.",
            "comment_grading": "Mid-term: pretty easy. 60 MCs in total.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are several questions that test you some really trivial matters. Other questions are mostly normal and straight-forward. <br /><br />Final exam: more challenging. 100 MCs including 5 multiple answer MCs. Maybe the topics tested are something new for DSEers, so I would say it is more challenging. The MC requires you to think more compared to the mid-term.<br /><br />Mid-term score: 55/60<br />Final score: unknown<br />Grade: A range",

Also, he would send a summary abt the topics he taught soon after class.<br /><br />Herrup is a foreign Prof. that should deserve more respect.

I'd definitely suggest studying from the textbook (you can find the pdf version from higher year students) off the written chapters as well as the PPT lectures notes BUT, only study the textbook parts that have been mentioned in the lecture notes first (textbook has lots of excess information) <br /><br />Here's the general outline of the course<br /><br />Introduction; DNA structure and gene expression (25)<br />Patterns of Gene Inheritance (23); Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance (24)<br />Development (22)<br />Reproduction (21)<br />Endocrine System (20)<br />Evolution (27)<br />Aging (22)<br />Circulatory System (12)<br />Respiratory System (15)<br />Lymphatic, Immune Systems &amp; Infectious Diseases (13)<br />Osmoregulation &amp; Excretion (16)<br />Digestive System and Nutrition (14)<br />Biotechnology (26)<br />Nervous System<br />Aging",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Herrup is an absolutely amazing lecturer. He speaks very fluently with a sense of passion about the topic and gets all excited about the content that he's lecturing on, which is always great. With all that being said, his PPTs/lecture notes are EXTREMELY confusing and disordered to the point where even he himself gets all confused as to what he's supposed to talk about next. Maybe it's a good technique for forcing students to show up to the lecture, since the notes make no sense otherwise. Make sure to jot down the things he says, they're pretty interesting even if they don't come up on the finals. (He asks general questions about what biology is all about and how systems interact with each other that some find hard but I find more useful)<br /><br />Professor Lam is great. Clear speaking, clear lecture notes, a really sweet guy. Again, there's a small issue with how he controls the noise level in the lectures, aka, he doesn't. <br /><br />Professor Liang looks really experienced in his field and very passionate for his work in genetics and cancer research HOWEVER he's just not a good lecturer. Simple as that. Not everyone can handle a class of 300 people while speaking eloquently, it's a fact. Just study from the textbook and his PPTs it's all good (He asks lots of questions in the exam that need only memorization)",
            "comment_grading": "The exams are almost identical to the IB Biology Paper 1, so kinda tricky and not so straight forward. I personally like the way they're written since it rewards students who spend time actually learning rather than memorizing a bunch of content like zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is one mid-term (50%) and one final (50%), each containing their own half of the semester with approximately 5MCQs from each lecture. There's 52-54 questions.<br /><br />I got an A overall but I don't think it's that easy to get an A range since most people around me who did well in the exams ended up with a B/<br /><br />-Midterms I got a 42/50 with mean 32.7 out of 50 and a SD of 8.0 <br /><br />-Finals I'm almost sure I got around 51/54 but the actual scores were never released.",

After you study with their lecture videos and ppt, you still will have to ask to the professor directly if you are curious or struggling in some materials.",
            "comment_grading": "Just like all life science courses, the grading is quite harsh.<br /><br />The overall score is divided by two, which are the mid-term exam and the final exam. The score distribution is 50% by 50%. The course does not take attendance and provides lecture videos to students who miss the lecture, which is very helpful.<br /><br />Both are in the similar level of difficulty, but due to relative scoring you should not expect getting a very high score in this course.",

He explains more than reading the powerpoint so you should at least go to his classes because there's not a lot of information in his ppts.",

Not much to learn here, and the lectures are perfectly skippable. Not that you could 吃中學老本, but the workload here is near zero compared to Herrup's part.",

It is simply natural for the professor to try and share as much as his knowledge to students.<br />Dr. Tang, meanwhile, is a typical Hong Kong lecturer. She speaks with a pretty Hongkong-ish accent you might find......rather.......hypnotizzzing. Well in her defense she got the way less interesting part, i.e. human physiology, a topic largely overlapping with DSE biology.",

These questions make up 20 marks in each exam.<br /><br />Not sure about the grading since it was kind of irrelevant to me, but here are some stats.<br />76.4% midterm, &gt;2.4 SD, mean 49.6%, max 84%<br />87.2% final, mean 54.8% iirc<br />--&gt; A+.",

After you take it you'll either feel like biology is your calling (if you like memorization and you see how useful studying biology is) or it's the grossest thing you'll ever study (especially for people who hate memorization).

Diseases are incredibly fun and not as difficult to study as you might imagine. The developmental biology, though, requires extensive Wikipedia reading and emailing Prof Herrup. It's extremely time-consuming, but the joy from understanding these processes makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />To be fair though, people who are gonna work at research labs for UROP will probably find this course mostly, if not completely, useless. It's not very helpful for biochemistry courses later on too I guess. So unless you wanna transfer to medical schools (for which this course is near-perfect), just think of the contents as something good to know, and no pressure really.",

His lectures are fantastically delivered in a fun, interactive and clear manner.

            "comment_teaching": "The 3 professors each have drastically different teaching styles. <br />Miller is very kind and entertaining. He explains the content clearly(well the content he teaches is generally easy to begin with) and frequently asks the class to revise/recall what he said during the lecture.<br />One thing to note about Miller: He really likes the details in his lectures. While his powerpoints may appear simple enough, every small detail(like the names of the two layers of connective muscle tissue and the formula for blood flow) will very likely end up on the exam. If Miller is teaching first, the very first lecture you will have in LIFS1902 will be something about psychoanalysis and psychology. Most people will think this content is useless and not pay attention in class. In fact, he WILL test you on stuff related to psychology, and it accounts for a sizeable portion of the exam questions(around 10-15). Even frivolous questions like who Konrad Lorenz or Simone de Beauvoir are will be asked. So make sure to memorize EVERYTHING from his powerpoints. <br /><br />Liang sure likes conceptual understanding and logical reasoning. He would frequently stop lectures to ask about why something occurs or why something is this and not that, then answers the question himself using logic. This will help you understand the concepts better but could get confusing at times.<br />Liang teaches the &quot;nitty gritty&quot; content of this course. His DNA and gene expression lecture(related to replication, transcription and translation, and cell control) is by far the hardest LIFS1902 lecture (to understand) you will experience and the questions asked by him in this module are the most difficult(I probably got many of those questions wrong). <br /><br />Li's teaching is a bit more &quot;generic&quot; than Liang's and Miller's. Apparently she's much newer to teaching this course; I still think her teaching's fine, just not as &quot;engaging&quot; as Miller or Liang. She allows students to directly ask questions on Canvas mid-lecture and answers these questions in-class, which could be helpful in conceptual understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, unlike Miller, you do not have to remember every detail she puts in her powerpoints; it's impossible if you do. The content she teaches is generally easier than Liang's but still covers a lot of new content not necessarily covered in high school biology. The questions she asks in the final exam are also easier than Liang's, although it would only be easy if you fully memorized all the important details in her lecture. <br /><br />In my opinion(all 3 are good instructors though):<br />Nature of content(how easy is it to understand and remember): Miller &gt; Li &gt; Liang (except for that weird psychology lecture Miller gave)<br />Teaching quality: Miller &gt; Liang &gt; Li<br />Difficulty of content: Liang &gt; Miller = Li",
            "comment_grading": "Having no quizzes and assignments comes with its own curse: the exams. They're not &quot;hard&quot;, it's just they can only grade you on the exams.<br />Basically 50% midterms, 50% finals<br />Midterms was 75 MCQ's and that's it<br />Finals was also 75 MCQ's and that's it<br />So your entire grade relies on 150 multiple choice questions. In my opinion, that's not good. <br />You would find this very aggravating especially if you tend to get nervous or mess up during examinations because there is no other way to redeem your score if you do poorly in exams. But I guess most LIFS lecture courses are like that due to how many people take them, smh...<br /><br />For me:<br />Midterms: 89.33% (67/75)<br />Finals: Unknown<br />Grade: A+",
            "comment_workload": "No assignments, no quizzes, no homework, no projects. <br />Many people are attracted to this course because of this promise(or, of course, they're choosing LIFS major and have this pre-enrolled). <br />You may start off this class thinking that it's very easy because there are no assignments or quizzes or anything. <br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />If you decide to revise frequently(which is what you should do in this course if you want good grades), this course quickly becomes one of the most demanding courses in your schedule. <br />Start revising at least 3 weeks before exams. Go through and re-write your notes, use the textbook to your advantage(if you bought it, if not that's still okay), watch the extra videos for Liang's content while making sure you understand his main concepts, re-watch Li's lectures if you're confused about some of the content, and photocopy all of Miller's taught lecture powerpoints into your brain(this works because Miller will give questions about content found exclusively in his powerpoints and nothing else).

Provides a lot o online materials as well. He tries to thrown in a few jokes as well to make lectures more fun as well.

He makes sure students understand what he wants to deliver to students. He sometimes include iPRS questions as well. His lectures are fun and lively and easy to follow. He plays music when its break time which is so refreshing and fun and relaxing.<br /><br />Herrup is amazing. He includes a lot of humor in his lectures to make lectures more fun. He throws in a lot of analogy to make students understand the material more easily. He is interactive with the class. He checks on how students are doing before class whenever its close to an exam period. He keeps messing up with the projector tho, that's a bit annoying but I am sure it is annoying for him as well so -<br /><br />They all give good ppts, although i personally prefer Lam's and Herrup's a bit more.<br /><br />All lectures were videotaped and put to Canvas.<br /><br />Having different lecturers or different chapters is not the funest thing ever.",
