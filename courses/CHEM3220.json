I think this was the reason that I got quite satisfactory marks (at least for me they were satisfactory). <br /><br />Prof. Leung held office hours throughout the semester but seemed just few of us went to ask him questions. But I know there are quite a number of us asked him questions through email, and I did too. He was responding to my emails very efficiently and clearly. By the way, office hours were optional. For the attendance of tutorials, it is optional but will be critical when your marks are on the boundaries of the letter grades. So please consider to join actively and discipline yourselves. <br /><br />The lectures were quite rush, but Prof. Leung was willing to stop and answer questions whenever we expressed that we didn't understand a certain part or wanted to know some more extensive knowledge. The lecture notes were clear enough. He provided a summary for each units too, they were so useful. He is a passionate teacher!",

Notable topics include catalytic mechanism of transition metal catalyst and syntheses/reactions of a wide variety of compounds explained in terms of various theory (These are the topics that make me feel that I finally can do things which a chemist is supposed to be capable of).",

For me, the time spent to study inorg II was less than inorg I but I am still able to maintain at a high level. The reason is that the content of inorg II rest on the foundation knowledge learnt in inorg I (which I have done pretty good) whereas you mostly start from scratch in inorg I. It seems there is more memorization judging from the content but I think the exams actually test your understanding rather than plain memorization.",

            "comment_workload": "I think it is quite a heavy workload if you want to desire a better grade.<br />Coordination Chemistry is fucking EZ so the mean of quiz 1 is quite high. You need to pay more attention to your careless mistake in the calculation.<br /><br />I think the most challenging part is organometallic catalysis and the main group chem. You need to remember all of the key reaction steps in the catalysis cycle and characteristics in the main group chem (close to remembering of the content of L10-14). Although it is the open-notes exam, you need to remember the content of the notes if you want to get a better grade. Hence, in quiz 3, mainly focusing on the final part, the mean is quite low. <br /><br />Mid-term is quite straight forward and you can answer it.<br />(Plz do problem sets, tutorial and review your assignment question)<br /><br />The final Exam is normal (not easy but not difficult). I think the professor wants to divide some outstanding and normal students so some questions are very challenging in MC and Long Q. In the final exam, I don’t have enough time to do all the questions in section B. So, if you want to get an A range, try to understand all of the concepts in lecture notes. Good luck!<br /><br />For others part, two professors encourage students to answer questions. You can get the marks if u do polling in zoom and tutorial sections. Because of I do all the polling in the lectures and attain all the tutorial sections after sometimes answer the questions. Therefore, I get the B+ rather than B. Sometimes this part can determines the grade. If you are not outstanding students and want to get higher grade, I highly suggest you answer the questions actively.<br /><br />Overall, the course is good. You can desire a better grade if you work hard. B+ is very good to me.",

I only got 22/32 (mean about 13) for that part. To be honest, the TAs and instructor gave me higher scores than I expected. I think the grading scheme is quite decent. I heard last year the final and quizzes are quite easy and the mean is high. Lots of people last year got quite high scores (like more than 95% but not A+)&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think this year the instructor has adjusted the difficulty and the mean is lower than last year. This year the instructor was likely to give more A+ since I got A+ eventually with overall about 93%, which is beyond my expectation.",

For example, you get 80/80 in the final exam but he thinks the paper may be difficult so he will make the full mark to be 78.Therefore, someone will get 80/78.",
