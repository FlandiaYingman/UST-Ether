            "comment_content": "I know this is a beginner’s course, but it fails to teach some of the very important basic programming concepts, for instance, <br /><br />pass by value and pass by reference (I know, theoretically there is only so-called ‘pass by value’ in Java, but still, you can pass a reference of an object/array (or any other reference types), which I believe should be regarded as pass by reference).<br /><br />What’s worse is that they will ask you questions related to this concept, i.e., what happens when you pass a variable to a function/method v.s. what happens if a reference of an array is passed.<br /><br />The above concept is not clearly explained in lecture notes on which, they say, the exams are based.<br /><br />Apart from that, the difference between objects and reference isn’t well-explained in the lecture notes too (though I don’t know if the professor did a good job in explaining it, since I didn’t attend most lectures). This concept is again tested in the final exam.<br /><br />What I am trying to say is, there is nothing introductory about the course. The content may be friendly to beginners, but the exams aren’t as they test knowledge not included in the notes. For this reason, I can’t give a good grade to this course. If you have programming experience, the course perhaps gives you the opportunity to explore the Java language, but if you don’t, just take the python course.<br /><br />They did recommend a textbook for reference, which can be handy if you knew some programming basics.<br /><br />The title is “introduction to java programming comprehensive version 10th edition”, just google it, the first result should be the PDF file.",
            "comment_teaching": "Didn’t attend the lectures, so I don’t know. The lecture notes are succinct, but you won’t get good grades if you just read them. You’ll need practice and a little bit of exploration because the notes won’t teach you everything, just as I said from the ‘Content’ part of the review. Also, do all the past papers so that you’ll have a better understanding of how the TAs will troll you with their trick questions.<br /><br />By the way, this course uses Greenfoot and the Eclipse IDE.<br /><br />Here is the link to the lecture notes and some of the past papers: https://bit.ly/2QkaSJr",

They like to test subtle concepts such as post-increment, pre-increment, pass by value, dangling else problems, etc. The long questions are just like any programming exercises you can find on the Internet/ from textbooks.<br /><br />Final exam (40%) (online, all MCs)<br /><br />Mean=88 SD=13.8<br /><br />Not as tricky as mid-term. But recursion questions can take a long time to finish. The most difficult should be one where you have to rewrite a nested loop into a non-nested loop (not tested in the last exam, but it was in the mock and in previous exams).<br /><br />As you can see the means for both exams are ridiculously high.

The teaching style of Desmond is fun, he always says&quot; Desmond is a good / bad guy&quot; XD<br /><br />while after class or in emails, he always answers students' questions until they solve their problem.<br /><br />Desmond has made briefing sessions for both assignment and explained the instructions detailedly. When he knew many students got problems and questions on assignment 2, he even postponed the deadline of submission.<br /><br />Desmond focuses more on logical thinking, knowledge understanding, application in exams and exercise, but not memorizing skills. Marks can be argued if the logic is correct but different from the model answer.",

The scope covers variable, class, main function, loop, if-else statement, file IO,&nbsp;&nbsp;and recursion.

In the second half, it is probably better to finish the lab work on your laptop the night before as it might take more time if your are stuck. TAs will help during the lab but there are a lot of students so you might have to wait. If you finish the lab work before the lab, you could just present it to the TA and leave straightaway.

First part is a lot easier than the second part, and overall it takes quite a bit of time (especially for beginners) so make sure you start this early and try out you program completely to ensure it works for all circumstances. Not much help is provided if you are stuck so find someone who knows Java or programming to help you. Information online is also useful sometimes.",

These 30 points are easy to get full.<br />The exam is rather broad than hard, since there always are questions that aren't mentioned before during the class, for like about 5 or 7 points? But most people can't get it right so actually it doesn't influence too much.

It does include a small section at the very end, although I doubt it'll be of much help.<br /><br />If you have some programming fundamentals, you should do alright.

The course was in video form and looked like it was made in early 2010s, which does fit with the BlueJ that the course uses, which feels and looks like a software from 30 years ago (it's insufferable to use). I highly recommend speeding up the videos by 2x speed, it would be nice if the website has a 3x or 4x speed option, because the videos were atrociously boring. Muting the video would also be doing yourself a favour, as the the voice of the instructor is barely audible without the subtitles.<br /><br />Of course you don't have to go through the completely useless videos, just search up some random online course, it'll be 100 times more educational.",

You are allowed quite a few tries and only a handful of test cases were used, so it's safe to assume that the majority of the students are able to complete these parts with full marks. The few hand checked lab should also be easy enough to get 100% if you follow the instructions (although it does get ambiguous sometimes).<br /><br />The exams are conducted on the canvas quiz system and you are allowed to use BlueJ, pdf files, google calculator and course websites. Past papers were provided, but they were not representative of the difficulty of the midterm, which was exceptionally easy, quite some people scored 100. They probably realised the issue and designed the final with greater difficulty. It was also filled with problems. The system did not recognise correct code and the questions were deleted because the program provided was not written properly. It led to great confusion during the exam and people did poorly compared to the midterm.<br /><br />The grading in general is very lenient, even if you messed up and get 80 something in the final, you can still get A+.

Looking for some extra-curricular Java tutorials may also help. If you are really not good at programming, consider COMP1021 (really), given by the following grading information.",
            "comment_teaching": "As an Indian (presumably from Andhra Pradesh?) lecturer, Muppala's English is peppered with heavy accent. This however, doesn't affect my understanding. After all, as he's responsive to questions asked in and after lectures, clarifications can be raised without doubt. Generally, a good lecturer.<br /><br />I previously heard about that Muppala shows cat videos during lectures according to a 2014 COMP1022P review on MSSSUG, but I don't observed any cat videos being shown on lectures. (after all, it's 6 years past...)<br /><br />Regarding TAs, they are supportive during labs. Some of them have heavy Chinese accent when speaking English, but are generally understandable.",

This means not only the mean is quite high, but also you'll face fierce competition.<br /><br />From an optimistic perspective, as there are plenty of programming experts, you can easily ask for help if you have any conceptual problems. For example, I met an experienced French student on course Whatsapp group, and he helped me a lot on understanding scopes.<br /><br />I have to say that I'm very lucky to survive in COMP1022P as a programming muggle (especially when I didn't look through course reviews before pre-enrollment). In general (and for other courses in HKUST, actually), you're in great trouble if your score is under the mean.",

You can get a good score if you can make early preparation for the 2 assignments (For example, I get full mark for the programming assignment). Workload is generally light.<br /><br />There's also weekly computer labs, focusing on recent topics taught. Although for most of the time you can get easy full marks for labs, it's highly advised that you should prepare for labs early, as you won't know the difficulty of the upcoming labs (For example, a number of students and I screwed in a lab related to if/switch statements).",

The syllabus goes from basics to the difficult ones, so it really helps build a good foundation before moving on.",
            "comment_teaching": "Desmond is an extremely good professor. If there was an A+ for me to choose for his teaching it would be A+. I am a programming dummy so during classes I would ask silly questions and ask him to repeat things that I could not catch up with. Desmond patiently answered my queries every time and would even stay behind class to explain more to me. The thing is he even encouraged me when I felt hopeless during the course, and I would say he has been more like a mentor than he is a professor. Desmond係科大既清泉 if you know what I mean.",
            "comment_grading": "I would be honest, I think the grading is really fair actually. If you are good at it, you get a good grade, if you are lost most of the time (like I was), you don't get a good grade. The distribution is really fair and it is not impossible to A range, but that definitely means a great deal of effort. Some students have a programming background and it is normal for them to do a bit better but then for those who don't and started from scratch, I would say it would be challenging. Yet again, I would say I never expected to get a good grade when I enrolled in the course. I just wanted to learn. So maybe if you kept this thought in mind, the grade wouldn't matter that much after all. The course is really worthy to take and the final grade is just a by-product to me. (Not gonna reveal my grade but I failed every test, think this says a lot)",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is alright. Sometimes Desmond would hold make-up classes when he has to catch up with syllabus (as it is quite a lot) and the make-up classes were quite demanding to me (teaching a lot and using long hours). Yet apart from that, I would say the workload makes sense. Two programming assignments throughout the course, and if you are good at it it shouldn't take you a lot of time.",

You can code in that period, but it is advised that you do it before attending so you can present your codes immediately when it is your turn. Normally each task takes around 10-15 minutes to do if you are capable, even if you are not you can find Desmond he is willing to guide you through the thinking process.<br /><br />For the 2 assignment it might be a bit tough (approximately 10 working hours each). One is image processing and another is implementing a game. Desmond will hold an extra session for introducing the assignment, extra topic covered in the assignment and tips that might be helpful in doing it.

I saw many students asking questions to professor after classes. On the other hand, the class was too easy for me and my friends having experience of programming. In this course, we used a software called greenfoot to get familiar with programming, which I think it's useless because it is making even difficult to understand the Java programming. There are more memorisation than Python course, but once u memorised it will be easier than Python course.",

Recursion and ADT are also harder than other session), you will be more prepared with the exam.<br /><br />There is also an online discussion area for us to discuss with other classmates and teaching team. We can ask question about concept taught on lesson as well as asking help on labs :D<br /><br />Oh and according to TC, LX mid term score are a lot higher than the average of all session.<br />All session average in mid term and sd:<br />avg = 78, s.d. = 20<br />LX's average in mid term and sd:<br />avg = 84, s.d.= 16",

What I must specify is that I also take it as my first programming course in university and I did not have any CS background in high school. And I found it acceptable. You know CS is a really competitive field and I am absolutely NOT among the top tier. So if you really want to dig into the computer science field, you should try this course first as a touchstone. It is the first step to become a genius programmer and trust me, every programmer must have gone through this step. And if you are just interested in programming but not meant to be a practitioner, you can absolutely go for the Python course.<br /><br />content:<br />Something about the basic concept of java in computer science, not too hard overall if you truly spend time on it and make the logic clear.",

            "comment_content": "I think this course gives a basic but thorough overview of java. The instructors and TA's assume everyone to be a beginner so they start with elementary topics and work at a good pace. So, if you are a beginner in java or even programming, like me, you can learn a lot and not feel like you're being left behind. After the midterm, you are introduced to a little bit more complex topics, but I still feel like the pace of the class is quite good.<br /><br />Labs were also a really good supplement to my learning. Overall, it was a very interesting class.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor was very nice and kept a light-hearted atmosphere during the lecture. He always asks if students have questions and is always willing to help students if they have questions after class. <br /><br />I believe he explained the concepts quite well. He also wrote programs during class to show how certain things worked instead of just reading off the presentation slides.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading in this course is probably the biggest downside. I heard many students already know java so the mean and SD of the mid term and final are quite high. If you want to get a high grade you cannot really make any careless mistakes. <br /><br />With that said, even if you're a beginner, if you work hard you can do really well in this class.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is quite low. If you want you can do labs before class and just demo it. However, the later labs can get a bit challenging. But, the TA's and student helpers are very helpful and you can always ask them questions. <br /><br />The assignment isn't too difficult. You just need to be a bit careful and double check your work.",

Gotta appreciate whoever made it But considering the high level that the course reaches by the end, the professors have to move kinda fast. Despite the fact that all the basic tools required to ace the examination are provided in the lecture slides and lab-work, you may not get the right idea required for a question as each concept and type of programming questions are not covered exhaustively. But with the right determination and proper coverage of the reference book, you can crack this course.",

But I feel like I was able to get that grade only because I learnt C++ in high school. But even that turned out to be a problem, because despite their similarities, there are some fundamental differences between Java and C++ and it kept bothering me throughout the semester.<br />Make no mistake, you can ace this course without any programming knowledge. I have friends who did. But you have to pay attention to the lectures, go through the reference book( I cannot emphasize this enough) and try the online quizzes. Download Java Eclipse from the course website and try out new codes every time you feel confused.",

Also, the concepts they teach were all essential information on handling JAVA. However, this course is not recommended for the students who start programming since JAVA is the quiet hard programming language. If you are a beginner, start with Python.",
            "comment_teaching": "the instructor NG, Wilfred Siu Hung 's teaching was bad. He knew well about the content but, his English speaking was terrible so, it made me hard to understand the several syntaxes of JAVA and the meaning. the instructor MUPPALA, Kumaraswamy R Jogesh's teaching was very satisfied. He had no difficulty in explaining the note and he often recommended the better way of study JAVA with fashion. Choose the good instructor if you want to take this course",
            "comment_grading": "Overall, the students get good marks. But, getting A grade will be super challenging. the mean grade of the mid/final exam was about 80%~83% and I got 96% in the midterm exam and 91% in the final exam.I almost got the full mark on the assignment and the lab but, my grade is still B+. The reason is too many students who know JAVA very well enter this course and the only very small percentage of students got A. Since my grade was not bad, I will give B on grading section.",
            "comment_workload": "QUIET HEAVY.<br />the students who start the programming will suffer a lot from the very hard written assignment and the programming assignment. Generally, the written assignment takes 4hours, the first programming assignment takes 12hours, the second programming assignment takes 24hours to finish to the average students.<br />You must attend the lab course once a week to get the lab grade.<br />Each lab course takes 2hours to finish. Hopefully, the grade of the workload is usually high. The first written assignment will the most challenging task for the beginners haha.",

The exams were designed to be more difficult so the mean was not very high.",

The second assignment was suggested by the TAs as the most difficult assignment ever in the course history as the A* algorithm was not even covered in the 2000-level courses. This assignment was designed by a foreign TA and Desmond was quite regretful for giving us this assignment so he provided tips to lower the difficulties before the deadline. Yet, you can learn many things in the assignments.",

Abstract Data Type (in this semester, this topic is included in the form of supplementary notes and not included in the exams)<br /><br />Although the content is quite adequate for an introductory course of\u001b Java, the topics included may be too difficult for programming beginners and for some people with little knowledge of object-oriented language. I would recommend those people to take COMP 1021 or COMP 1022Q instead.",

(Mean: 78.51, SD: 17.79) The overall percentage is 95.3% and I got an A.<br /><br />The grading is quite harsh because many people with strong programming background would get really high marks in the exams. So be careful in the exams, otherwise you will lose a lot of marks and get a lower grade.<br /><br />Also, the time given for assignment and lab work is quite sufficient (in case you cannot finish your lab work in the lab session, you can still submit it within a few days), so please finish all work to ensure you won't lose marks which others don't.<br /><br />(Fyr, the grading rubrics is attached)",

However for the later ones, you need to actually solve the tasks by yourself. The lab notes only serves as very general guidelines (although sometimes the TA will provide some hint)<br /><br />For the assignment\u001b, in this semester we are required to reproduce the game &quot;Mastermind&quot; by using &quot;GreenFoot&quot; (a programming platform using Java with GUI). The assignment takes really much time so I recommend spending a few weeks on it.

It generally covers variable, concepts of classes and object, arithmetic and boolean expressions and branching statements in the context before midterm.

The overall content is just basic concepts and not much sophisticated. If you want to learn more, you can always refer to Greenfoot API or some other online documentations.",

Just follow the professor carefully in lectures you can easily nail most of them. Some of them is confusing and it is better to ask to professors he will cross check and give feedback. It is not time-consuming but it can help you with your understanding. If you don't want to write your own games, then finishing the assigned project just takes about 3-5 nights in total.

It taught about basic programming techniques in Java at first and more advanced applications mostly after mid-term. The course is not very difficult to handle but as a beginner in programming I found it quite hard to understand the logic. To be able to understand everything I needed to read the textbook and the powerpoint slides thoroughly and try the codes by myself using my own computer using my spare time. Maybe because I am not very interested in programming, I did find the course a bit dull and demanding. My advice is to take this course only if you are very fond of the subject.",

            "comment_content": "The course is divided into two parts. The basics are taught with Greenfoot, a graphical intro to java. It might be confusing for those who have some sort of programming background, but generally it is a good starter programming tool. The second part is taught with Eclipse.<br /><br />The topics includes if, while, do..while loops, arrays, basic console and file i/o, etc. All of those are fairly easy. Except for recursion, which I have heard that many struggled with.<br /><br />Labs are very easy, the TAs didn't mind you bringing your already finished lab works to their sessions, so you have plenty of time to prepare well at home if you find any of the works hard.<br /><br />The assignment is about some Chinese chess game. If you don't already know how to play the game, it might be a little hard to get the rules.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is very clear. The ppt slides are easy to read and understand.

So if you really can't finish one of the requirements, you can still get full marks by doing some bonus tasks.<br /><br />The exams are not hard but that results in a very high mean and s.d. Mean is ~80% while sd is ~18% for both the exams. So you can't really have careless mistakes or it will cost you a subgrade.",
            "comment_workload": "both exams are open-book exams, so you only need to fully understand the concepts to take them<br />labs are easy, the TAs are helpful<br /><br />overall light workload comparing to other UST courses",

            "comment_content": "An introductory course with a main focus on Java programming. At the beginning a graphic-based software, Greenfoot, is used to introduce Java in a rather relaxing way, since it is less tedious than traditional Java programming software. It provides a decent platform for programming newbies to try out. After Midterm the focus is shifted to Eclipse, a more professional Java software. The course generally covers most of fundamental elements in Java language, like language grammar, Class, Variable, Method, Looping, If-statement, File I/O, Recursion, etc. You definitely don't need to be afraid of taking this seemingly tough course, since all these stuff are easy to get familiar with.",
            "comment_teaching": "Very good professor who has a strong passion in teaching programming. Sometimes he makes jokes in lesson. Occasional in-class mini projects are to be expected (e.g. Make a piano in Greenfoot). If you sit at the front of the lecture theatre he may invite you to answer his questions. A friendly atmosphere throughout the lessons. Lab sessions are also compulsory which in fact help you understand concepts introduced in the lectures. Each lab consists of several tasks and TAs will check your work and grade it (actually if you can finish those tasks then full grades will be given right away. They rarely ask you questions).",
            "comment_grading": "Good grade as usual. Since most students haven't studied ICT or computer-related subjects in secondary school, it is never a hard job to get a good grade if you are hard-working enough. For those who have studied ICT (no matter which elective, Database for myself), you will find it very easy to overwhelm others. In my opinion, ICT is much harder and broader than COMP1022P.",
            "comment_workload": "One Midterm and one Final. Very light workload. A lab task for every week. You may want to finish it before the lab session. Only one assignment (it is more like a mini project) is required to finish throughout the semester, which is a Board Game &quot;Jungle&quot; (鬥獸棋) and you need to use Greenfoot to write the game. Skeleton is given so no pressure on finishing the project. Even you are unable to finish some of the required features, you can always complete bonus tasks to get full mark.",

Type of variables, class, method, array, recursion etc. are included in the content. The difficulty escalates after the mid-term exam so be prepare to spend a bit more time on the second half of the course. <br />Most of the course uses Greenfoot to help you learn how to do coding. The later part uses Eclipse, which is slightly more complicated.",
            "comment_teaching": "For some reasons I have attended some lectures from each of the three instructors. I shall do a brief summary of their teaching style.<br />Prof. NG: He uses ppt that combines his own input and the original slides. He explains things clearly and patiently. He has a sense of humor and is always well-prepared for lectures.<br />Prof. KIM: He includes quite a lot of extra things in his lecture (e.g. Hashmap) which are not required for exams. Even students with programming experience can learn something new. His lectures usually move at a fast pace. He is also witty and seems to enjoy interacting with students. <br />Prof: MUPPALA: He uses the original ppt slides and goes through them quite slowly, which is very ideal for any beginner. I observe that students tend to ask questions more eagerly in his lectures because he is very patient.",
            "comment_grading": "Lab sessions<br />There are tasks in each lab session: attending the lab is one of them. Labs before midterm are easy. They get harder after midterm, especially when Eclipse is used. I personally would do pre-lab on my own before the lab sessions. The TAs would help you if you can't complete the tasks but sometimes they can't help all the students given the time limit so you best be prepared.<br /><br />Midterm<br />It was quite easy. Many students got over 90%. The format was a few multiple choice questions followed by coding.<br /><br />Final exam<br />Open-notes. The first part was multiple choice and the second part was coding. The key to get a high score is always a clear concept. Again, many students got over 90%. <br /><br />Overall, the course gives good grades! And it is enjoyable as well!",
            "comment_workload": "Assignment<br />My assignment was to make the Jungle board game 鬥獸棋 on Greenfoot. It was divided into two parts, which had different deadlines.<br />I found the &quot;save&quot; function (I/O) the hardest. There were bonus points for you to gain by setting extra functions, such as sound effect. Even if you fail to program some of the basic requirements, you can still get full mark with the bonus points. The TAs would be quite busy towards the end of the semester so doing the assignment and ask for help earlier might be a good idea.",

Plus, he seems to be just reading aloud a script, very boring.<br /><br />I learned Java 6 years ago so I didn't watch most of the videos. I watched tutorials from https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28 and I recommend this playlist a lot.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is similar to COMP 1022P courses by other instructors in the past. Around 95% total mark can get you an A, so it's quite bad but should be fine for people who learned programming prior.<br /><br />However, the mid-term exam and final exam are poorly designed.<br /><br />Here is a summary of the exams' style. They are delivered online as Canvas quizzes. PDF notes, Google Calculator, BlueJ, and the course website (HKMOOC) are allowed references.<br /><br />There are 10 questions in the mid-term exam and 18 questions in the final exam. Some are MCs, some require you to process the code manually and determine the output, and others require you to fill in the blanks to complete a program. Codes that aren't intended to be copied into BlueJ will be displayed as an image.<br /><br />The instructor (or TA) really wants to utilize Canvas' auto-grading system, so he adds a lot of warnings asking us not to add &quot;;&quot;, full-stops &quot;.&quot;, unnecessary spaces &quot; &quot;, etc. in bold, italics, and with capitalized words. The utterly long warnings take up to half part of a question.<br /><br />There is 1 error in the mid-term exam and 2 errors in the final exam, causing us to waste all our time on those questions. Combined with the warnings distracting us from reading the core part of the question, all of us become careless in at least one question. Therefore, the maximum in the final exam is 96/100, as opposed to 100/100 in mid-term exam (and 103/100 in MATH 1023 mid-term exam).<br /><br />Moreover, quite a few questions don't really test our programming abilities with Java. One asks us to process a code but everything is compressed (like two methods in one line, brackets, if statements, for loops, return statements, all put in a single line, which is allowed in Java but not in Python). Honestly, it only acts as an eye test but nothing else.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is quite light. The deadline for everything in part 1 is before the mid-term exam and in part 2 is before the final exam. It took me 4 days in total to finish all the assignments.<br /><br />1. MCs: You get around 3-5 MCs per module to test your understanding of the topic.<br /><br />2. Labs: You have a lab per module, and inside a lab, you have 3-4 related tasks constituting the entire program of the lab. Each task, you write around 10-20 lines of code for each task, but the task is very easy to understand and the code logic is very simple.<br /><br />3. Discussions: You need to figure out the answer to the given question and post the answer in the discussion forum. There are only a few discussion tasks, and honestly, you can just copy the answer from the forum.<br /><br />4. Project: It is just a longer lab with around 5 tasks, plus some code can be copied from previous labs.",

Only few questions are about some memorizing knowledge that you can find on your lecture note and others are all tricky questions. Usually those tricky stuff came from the questions asked by students after class, and those students are usually more advanced with respect to learning programming language.<br /><br />Conclusion: Try to listen to and understand the questions students asked during class or after class + Find a good Java partner to tackle the assignments = For a Java newcomer to get good grades :)",

            "comment_content": "Personally, I had no problems understanding the concepts of java and writing simple programs in class. However, I felt that the lecture content was highly deceiving when I sat for the exams. The TAs make very tricky question papers which are extremely difficult if you do not have previous java experience. Whatever taught in class is completely useless and honestly, you can sit in your own dorm room and teach yourself. Even then, you will probably end up with a C or below if you are not an experienced programmer.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is not very good in the sense that the professor teaches nothing that is relevant to doing well in the exams. He will explain concepts to you well but the real essence of programming lies in practice and actually writing programs which is not done in class at all. I found the TAs to be extremely unhelpful especially an Indian one who I believe relishes in seeing students miserable with their assignments and labs. So if he is the one grading them for you, I wish you good luck :)",

He gave around 30% A range.",

In this year, they gave us a Greenfoot task that was hard for people, and they had to add extra code to the skeleton code to make it easier. I personally think Desmond should have held the advising session for the second assignment as he did with the first assignment (The TA in charge of explaining was not so good).<br /><br />For the lab sessions (about 10 sessions) they are easy and just do the tasks before you go to the lab and you are good.",

But if you're a newbie, better take a rain check or do an online course beforehand, because it becomes too much work load.

Learning the basic syntax in lectures, take them into use in labs and assignments, and good luck in exams. Things learn in the notes are just basic knowledge and the course is requires more in understanding and logical thinking to be demonstrated through tasks and exams.

He and the TAs are always willing and able to answer your questions after class, in lab and on canvas, and of great effectiveness. But again, some have fairly heavy accent, both in Cantonese and English (No prob if you are good in Indian or Mandarin), which is the only problem i can think of.<br />(Even though I absolutely gave up the course in around Nov and did not attend a single lecture or watch them back)",

And as previous years, mean is somewhere high in the 70s; +1 sd is high 80s ~&nbsp;&nbsp;mid 90s, and you know the rest. <br />So if you know nothing about Java, and can't get full marks due to carelessness, choose another course and don't be like me. One TA was absolute sympathetic and surprised at me that I picked this course when I have no idea about Java (He said I'm so 'chur' but I'm just an idiot who has no idea what (s)he is doing)<br />Luckily it seems the final paper will be set according to the midterm result (which is absolute horrendous and is like 10 marks lower than previous years), the final was much easier than the previous years and the mean is like 10 marks higher (which is not a good thing as +1 sd is like mid 90s, and +1.1 is [no one cares/gets] )",

(If you understand the syntax well. And yes, from a programming idiot prospective)<br />You can do your lab tasks before hand and show them to the TA if you do not waste your time. Or if you are an idiot like me, you can get the answer and attendance after sitting through a whole 2 hrs in the lab.<br />Assignment is to make a mastermind (with a twist, ask the TA you are curious if you are not a cat). It is separate into 2 parts just to relieve your workload. First part is fairly straight forward (copy from notes cough cough) while the second part requires more logical thinking and understanding on syntax. It can be fairly time consuming if you get stuck, and the TA will NOT offer any help out of fairness. I do it on my laptop on my long journey to/from the serene UST such that I didn't find it really costing me much time. It will not be that time consuming if you do the task over a long period of time. Don't do it in the last minute or you could be thinking of mushroom when you are stuck.",

Most tasks are relatively short.<br /><br />Assignments are much harder so you may need to discuss with some course-mates and help each other. Most take a lot of time to think through and finish so word of advice is start right after the assignment is released and not a few days before deadline. Desmond is very helpful and if u send him an email he will try his best to help you with the assignment.",
