Introduction to econometrics<br />2. Review of probability and statistics<br />3. Simple Linear Regression: Estimation （即係點做）<br />4. Simple Linear Regression: Inference （即係做完點分析）<br />個人認為Simple Linear嗰part even簡單過2411....<br />----------------Midterm-----------------<br />5. Multiple Regression: Estimation （基本上同Simple一樣，舉一反三）<br />6. Multiple Regression: Inference (又係同上面一樣咁濟...)<br />7. Non-linear Regression （時代革命同埋佢sem頭教得太慢cut埋，但睇落一啲都唔難，take下log，d下數咁）<br />8. A guide to empirical study （時代革命同埋佢sem頭教得太慢cut埋）<br /><br />讀完真係好似無讀過咁，啲content係講緊你有basic stat個底去睇書可以一日自學晒，完全唔明啲prerequsite同4credits係jm9。",
            "comment_teaching": "雖然content好唔掂，但lu xun教書教得唔差，個logic講得好清晰，同埋佢會make sure你明背後個intuition，而唔係淨係玩數學。但佢真係教得好L慢，一版powerpoint可能講緊joint probability，佢要講成20分鐘咁...同埋佢啲英文真係好唔掂，個accent好重，有啲一舊舊。我諗對一啲stat真係好差嘅人真係一個好好嘅professor，但對一啲有認真讀prerequisite嘅人嚟講都真係悶到抽筋。自己睇路走堂。另外佢會示範點樣用STATA，都係用電腦撳一次俾我地睇咁。<br /><br />Tutorial 兩個星期先一次，懷疑個tutor都覺得無野教，上堂就做下exercise，計下啲tricky少少嘅數咁囉，唔上都無所謂，但佢啲notes都唔差嘅。",
            "comment_grading": "考試都好正路，通常頭一兩題concepts，之後計下數，臨尾一兩題係啲簡單嘅proofs咁，concepts啲題目係真係要十分心水清，make sure你知晒啲terminology嘅definition同可能有無啲咩special case嘅examples之類啦。計數就簡單野，可能俾三點你計返條regression line出嚟，再計下啲相關嘅野，例如R square之類。proofs就反而係最simple嗰part，真係跟住啲formula砌就得，唔會要用啲好hardcore嘅math skills。Midterm一版cheat sheet，final兩版，基本上整得好就玩晒成個course。<br /><br />Grading system:<br />6 Problem sets 15%<br />Midterm 30%<br />Final 55%<br /><br />General Performance:<br />Problem set: basically full for everyone<br />Midterm: 74/100<br />Final: Unknown<br /><br />My Performance:<br />Problem set: full<br />Midterm: 96/100<br />Final: Unknown<br /><br />Final Grade: A+",

But for the mid-term and final, only less than 30% of the questions required calculations and no R-related questions at all!

I only step on the overall mean (or even slightly below), but I can still manage to get a B.

When he is explaining some intuitions, he tends to explain deeper and it is understandable. But when it comes to mathematical derivation and infererence, he teaches poorly and skips a lot of steps when explaoing which makes me feel puzzeled. But he is nice and helpful as you are free to ask any questions and interrupts him during the class. He is willing to answer your questions which I think it is the most important part. Moreover, he teaches more concepts behind econometrics than the math itself and teaches based on the powerpoint slides. All the exams will only be tested based on what he had taught in lectures and powerpoint slides with some math proof. So the teaching is absolutely relevant to the exams and it is better for you guys to listen to his lectures because it is hard to understand just by looking at the powerpoint slides. Also, he will explain the past paper questions and tells us which part is important which is quite good.",

And I think he kind of rushed a bit on the big data part. But don't worry&nbsp;&nbsp;because you are not expected to know much about big data.<br /><br />To be honest, I expected this course to focus more on the mathematical tools of econometrics, but really it didn't. I wouldn't say I'm 100% satisfied with this but I have to say it makes sense since it's only an introductory course and many of the students don't have a solid foundation of math knowledge. So it's okay if your math is not so good. You can still do well in this course.<br />Many have compared this course with ISOM2500/2600, and some say that they are kind of similar. But my opinion is that even they use the same mathematical tools, their core idea is quite different. While ISOM2500/2600 focus on interpretation solely from mathematical results, this course introduces and focuses on the concept of &quot;causal inference&quot;. I think it's vital to always keep that in mind to do well in this course.<br />And I think it's totally fine if you didn't do well in ISOM2500/MATH2411 since this course gives you a chance to &quot;start over&quot;. Professor will start from the ground up to talk about some basic probability and statistics stuff.<br /><br />The textbook for this course is Introduction to Econometrics by J. H. Stock and M. W. Watson. It's already sufficient to only know what's on lecture slides since the exam is exclusively based on them, but I think reading the textbook will give you a more solid understanding of econometrics.",

He would add in his own understanding and some more &quot;modern&quot; stuff in lecture. He would also give us some tips that might be useful for our future study/research. As someone who just finished his postgraduate study I think he understands us a lot. And I think he's opinion on teaching and grading is quite &quot;advanced&quot; in this university.

Fortunately, I listened carefully sometimes and once the example he gave was one of the possible answers in the midterm. Going to class and listening to him carefully is therefore important. <br />The tutorials are even more boring(Peter I'm sorry for that). I together with some friends don't think the TA can explain a problem clearly and briefly. Generally TA will either provides some questions from past paper and work them out with us or goes through what has been mentioned in class, sometimes with new things added though. Those only mentioned in tutorials are not tested of course but may help you get a deeper understanding. Not every week has a tutorial.",

Statistics Review<br />Some of the things are not covered in Math2411/2421, and he will also introduce some terminology that are useful in this course, so don't skip it.<br /><br />4. Linear Regression on Single Regressor<br />5. Robust Standard Error<br />6. Control Variables and Multiple Regressors<br />7. F-test<br />8. Application<br />Some real world examples are given.<br />9. Advanced Methods <br />Heterogeneous Causal Effects, Instrumental Variables, Difference-in-Differences.<br /><br />This course focus on<br />1) the correctness of the model<br />2) the math part (inference step)<br /><br />I would say wang peng put a lot of emphasis on the first part. In the final exam part 2 (56/100), there are a lot of these kinds of philosophical question:<br />- If the data generation process is like this, can we say that some population parameter is independent of another population parameter?<br />- Under different data generation process, can we believe that the OLS estimator is correctly describing the causal effect?<br /><br />These questions are very hard to answer (or even search in net I think), it really test your understanding on the material of this course and how carefully you can think of to make sure the models are correct. It often requires insights on real life situation. Therefore, even you are good at the Math part, you still have to understand the art of Econometrics to ace this course (when Wang Peng is teaching).<br /><br />I would say this arrangement is reasonable because an incorrect model leads to incorrect inference. The math part can be solved by machines easily today. So the job of Economists is to define a correct model. Actually, I appreciate such kind of art/philosophy of Econometrics.",
            "comment_teaching": "Wang Peng is a very nice, kind gentleman, and he tries to provide as much help as possible to students.<br /><br />I would say his teaching is quite good but the design of the content of lecture notes is bad.<br /><br />Let's talk about his verbal delivery first. His English is quite good with light accent. One problem is that he never stress some points, meaning that he speaks everything at similar tone. He will speak the mathematical formulas directly which is difficult to listen to, e.g. variance of sum equals to sum of variance plus 2 times covariances. Luckily I got Zoom this year so that I can replay. Besides these things, I think his explanations are quite good.<br /><br />But the flow of lecture notes is very bad.<br />Since I take Math2411 before and get destroyed by ycw. I really appreciate that the review part make me understand a lot more compared in Math2411.<br />However, starting at chapter 4, I lose my mind of the sudden change of topic. It is like I haven't attend to class for few weeks. A lot of notations that are quite confusing and some math equations that jumps out from nowhere.<br />For example, the average treatment effect E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}) is very confusing. I originally thought it is for a single person but it is actually the average effect on the whole population.<br />Another example: the mean independence requirement for OLS model: E(u|X) = 0 jumps out from nowhere. I can fully understand it after the chapter of control variables. It is used to prevent the &quot;selection bias&quot;, meaning say people choosing particular treatment X may tends to have certain characteristics that affect our results.<br /><br />I guess he intended to teach us all the theory part first, then it will be much easier (he thought) to learn to subsequent content. For example, in the first few slides of chapter 4, there is a slide talking about heterogeneous variance population model. It will be used in ch5 and ch9 later but he decided to put it earlier.
