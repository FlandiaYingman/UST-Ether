            "comment_content": "Pretty interesting introduction to blockchain if you wanna know more about the topic. The first 60-70% of the course was relatively easier to understand. It might be a bit confusing or overwhelming at first, but I personally think it helps a lot if you're willing to rewatch the recordings. I find it easier to learn through the recordings as I can keep going back if there's a part Im confused about. It's also easier for you to jot notes as some content arent available on slides. The latter part is a bit more confusing and difficult to understand. Overall there's not a lot of content to go through",

            "comment_grading": "Class Participation 5%<br />i feel like i wasnt too active throughout the sem lol, just occassionally answered qs in chat. And i think attendance isnt recorded as well<br /><br />Assignment 10% (5% + 5%)<br />Assms are pretty easy, the prof spends a lssn talking about each assm and teaches you how to do it lol. Took me probably an hour for each assm. Got full marks for both<br /><br />Group Project 15%<br />I think the project was quite confusing for me. It requires you to develop the code for sth blockchain/smart contract related but not much of the course is really about coding. So if you or your teammates dont have any programming background its quite challenging. The deliverables are the code and the 2(?) page report. The report is really simple, its just the coding part thats challenging. For me and my group, I feel like we didnt really spend too much time on the project and we chose a relatively simpler topic, but I guess we did ok, dont know what grade we got though<br /><br />3 exams 20% each<br />The topics for the first two exams are pretty easy, and because the prof spends a lot of time repeatedly explaining the concepts, in the end the amount of content isnt that much. Theres not a lot of stuff to study and the exam is just a few mc questions plus one or two short qs, really simplen format. The last exam was more challenging, and the topics were a bit confusing to me.<br />I was just slightly above mean for the first two exams, didnt receive the grading for the last exam but i feel like i didnt do well<br /><br />I felt like I was going to get a B range but surprisingly got an A so i was pretty happy with it lol",
            "comment_workload": "Actually pretty light workload. Assms were really simple and fast to complete. For the exams, I usually study about 2-3 days before the exam (I usually listen during class or would watch the recordings afterwards). As for the project it depends, but it was ok for me",
