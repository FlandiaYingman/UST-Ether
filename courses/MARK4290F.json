This Course is aiming to help future Marketing Directors and Leaders to navigate different business management trends in an environment where the simultaneous creation of Social Added-Value from Brands keeps increasing. It will provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create short-term impact or long-term genuine change and how this can lead to increase loyalty and market share. Students will explore dimensions of product brand-based and corporate “purpose-led” marketing and learn to analyze and develop successful marketing and organizational strategies that deliver mutual benefits for business and society. Areas of study include: greenwashing, cause-related marketing/purpose marketing strategy and brand activism.",
