        "description": "This is the second part of the two-semester sequence on the ethnographic method. Students will continue with their fieldwork, at the same time they will submit field notes for class discussion, with the goal of writing a final paper that can be submitted to an academic journal at the end of the course. A hands-on practicum, the  seminar provides a platform for students to read and comment on each others' field notes and on-going analyses, and offer critical and constructive comments on each others' work. We will also dissect exemplary published work using the ethnographic method and learn to construct argument and edit ethnographic data for publication purposes.",
