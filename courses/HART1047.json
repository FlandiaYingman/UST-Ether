        "name": "Introduction to Chinese Landscape Painting",
        "description": "Of the three main categories of traditional Chinese painting, namely, landscape, flower‐and‐bird, and figure painting, landscape painting has developed a unique significance through history. Painters in every dynasty and epoch, whether official imperial court painters or literati painters in their cultural circles, have made brilliant achievements in this field. They may have different focuses, techniques and presentation methods of nature; nevertheless, what they always show is the inner scenery of the painter, the ideal world constructed by the painter. Students will learn basic brush techniques, through which they will understand the creative process of Chinese painting with the focus on landscape painting. They will be encouraged to create their own works through the application of the techniques and attempts to reform this traditional art form. \n中國繪畫以山水、花鳥、人物為三大主要分科。山水畫發展歷史悠久，經歷不同朝代及社會民生的變化，包含著複雜卻又千絲萬縷的關係。無論宮廷畫院，文人派系，甚至新中國時期以祖國建設為題的山水作品，都是以傳統基礎為依，堅守外師造化，卻不失時代環境的獨特個性。透過學習山水畫，通過臨摹、作品觀摩、範本挑選、課堂示範和練習等，同學不但能學習相關技法，也能對中國藝術的審美能力有所提升。",
