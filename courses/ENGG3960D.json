        "description": "RoboMasters Robot Contest is a robot competition platform created for young engineers. Participating teams will get out of the classroom and independently develop and manufacture robots for the shooting confrontation. The contest will provide them with an opportunity to obtain precious practical skills and use strategic thinking, combine theories with practice and create advanced smart robots through fierce competition. (http://www.robomasters.net/) Enrollment in the project course may require instructor's approval. May be graded PP.",

            "comment_content": "For software engineering, you will learn C++, C, perhaps python, C# and even ARM assembly languages! You can also implement your robot with whatever language you want (if you can do it). You will also get chance to learn about different mathematical models, computer vision and AI, getting expose to cutting-edge technologies. After this you can show your fancy computing skills (like opening a bunch of terminals and operate you computer fully on command line) to your peers and laugh at their stupidity.<br /><br />For hardware and mechanical engineers, you will obtain practical experience on CAD software like Solidworks, fusion 360, Altium Designer, which students in these majors will only learn a tiny little bit of them during their industrial training. Also we will enhance your craftsmanship by offering chances to manufacturer robots (soldering, 3D printing, CNC, and assembling different kinds of stuff)<br /><br />Also prepare yourself with a sufficiently spaced hard disk since you will install multiple operation systems, you will use windows for different kind of CAD software and IDEs, each of them cost you at least 10 GB of memory, now you will gain a excuse for getting a gaming PC for deep learning, rendering or whatever.<br /><br />for mechanical engineers you can also ask your parents to buy a set of German made tools to show them off.",
            "comment_teaching": "senior members are very kind and nice and gentle and HANDSOME (I am serious :D), they are willing to share all knowledge they have (if you can catch up), they will also teach you hands on hands (if you are pretty or gay enough)<br />I got a pleasure and honor, of being taught hands on hands at the beginning stage, cuz I am genuinely curious on themselves and what they know so they thought i am cute (/ω＼).",
            "comment_grading": "GOOD <br /><br />as long as you work<br /><br />BTW we got many beautiful girls and handsome boys here this year, no worries for not getting out of the pool, this worth much more than grades isn't it.",
