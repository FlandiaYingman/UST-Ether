If you only took FINA2303 before (my case), most likely over half of the content in this course would be new to you. So it is not recommended to skip lessons, as each topic only spends ~1.5 weeks to go through.<br /><br />By the end of the course, you should be very familiar with the relation between risk &amp; return, because you will have drawn countless times the mean return-risk diagram. Although the course covers a wide range of knowledge, you must not fail in the following important topics: Capital allocation, Markowitz, CAPM, and APT. These topics require your full understand before taking the exams.",

Your understanding in the concepts are critial and the calculations are very simple. Darwin likes giving true or false questions (5 marks each) in both exams, each question requires your explanation of choice.<br /><br />I got mean in the MT but work much harder in the final. I don't know my final exam result but I got B+.",
