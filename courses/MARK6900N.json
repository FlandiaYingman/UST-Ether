        "description": "This four-session doctoral seminar will explore a few select topics in consumer behavior from an information processing perspective. The course has two objectives: a) To enhance students’ understanding of and interest in the specific topics under study; b) To use those topics as a platform to develop critical, scholarly thinking about consumer behavior in general. Thus, students are expected to actively read prior research in different areas – i.e., they should try to understand the authors' ideas and develop the habit of constructive criticism of the research, including developing their own hypotheses and theoretical perspectives that build on the current knowledge base.
