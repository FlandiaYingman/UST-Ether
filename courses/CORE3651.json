        "description": "This course surveys the major developments of Chinese ink painting from the late 19th century to the present, focusing on her interaction with foreign cultures, debate over continuity and reform, search for modernity, and adaptation to the political, social, and cultural transformations in different historical periods. Discussions will give equal attention to techniques, stylistic analysis, and interpretations in historical and cultural contexts. In content, this course complements what is not covered by CORE 2651/HUMA 2660 at a more advanced level.",
