        "name": "(Un-)Sustainable Consumption",
        "description": "The choices we make in daily life - what we eat, what we wear, the products and services we use - are defining our lifestyle. Sustainable consumer behavior means that we constantly have to rethink our ways of living and make decisions that help to prevent adverse impacts on the human well-being and minimize the use of natural resources and reduce emissions and wastes. Yet, as the number and complexity of consumer goods rises, making sustainable choices becomes an increasingly difficult task. This class will look at the ingredients in products that we consume on a daily life basis, and explore features that make them (un-)sustainable. Besides practical applications, the class will give insides to what is influencing our consumption behavior and what can governments or corporates do to promote sustainable products and services, and protect consumers and the environment from potentially harmful substances.",
