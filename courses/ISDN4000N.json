        "description": "This course is about to continue with Product Innovation by integrating systems as physical, functional, feasibility prototype through Design. Either a self-chosen topic, this elective study is about how to enhance previously engineering designed technical packages by conceptualising [industrial] product design and prototyping physically through Innovation Design by integrating systems to physical, functional, feasibility prototypes (e.g., of an automated actuator-sensor-control system) or an articulated joint if no own topic is chosen. Each participants’ augmented concept and skill on how to build a functional prototype will be supported by live supervision. The elective study includes in class discussions on successful examples and case studies to be transferred by the student[s] to practical hands-on improved physical models for materialising either their concepts or including – but not limited to – kinematic chains, joints, and drives, plus eventually sensors and actuator-sensor-interfaces alternatively; by supervision for group(s) or 1 to 1 for individual student(s) as desired. Instructor’s approval is required.",
