        "description": "This course introduces the use of physical methods in the study of biological systems, including macromolecules, membranes, nerves, muscle, photosynthetic systems and visual systems. The biological systems to which the methods are applied will be surveyed and current interpretations of their structure and function will be discussed. The treatment of biological phenomena will be based on physical principles with appropriate mathematics when necessary. The emphasis will be on the applications of physics in biology.",

However, the course assessments are quite easy and do not test our more advanced topics. <br /><br />Ref textbook: Physical Biology of the Cell by Rob Phillips",

His english/presentation skills may be slightly polarizing among the student body but he puts in the effort. More importantly, he ensures good grades to his students and always arranges generous bonuses to boost our grades. He assured that most students will score at least B+.",

The weight of the report might be changed depending on the class performance.<br /><br />The exams are closed-book but all the necessary formulae and constants are given in the exam paper.<br /><br />My scores: <br />HW: 399/425&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(mean: 301)<br />Midterm: 24/30 (mean: 18)<br />Finals scores are undisclosed. However, I'm pretty sure I scored 35+ out of 40.<br />Bonus report scores also weren't released.<br /><br />Final grade: A+",
            "comment_workload": "One HW every week (~1-3 questions). Relatively easy as long as you are able to understand what formula is applicable for the problem at hand. Tutorials always give out hints for HW before the deadline.<br /><br />Exams are relatively easy as long as you are good at calculations with a good sense of problem-solving. Prof gives many hints on what kinds of problems will appear in the exam during his lectures.<br /><br />The bonus project report might take some effort though as you need to explore literature and come up with a concrete project that displays your understanding of the subject matter in a logical manner.Of course, don't copy from ChatGPT, prof runs an AI checker.",
