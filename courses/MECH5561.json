But no worry, professor explain in every bit of details. A lot of examples are also provided and covered in the lecture,<br /><br />If you have taken robotics course in your bachelor degree, this course help you refresh and crushed into more advanced topics. Syllabus listed below: for your reference:<br /><br />Week 1: Configuration space <br />Week 2: Rigid-body motions<br />Week 4: Robot kinematics <br />Week 5: Robot motion planning: foundations<br />Week 6: Sampling-based motion planning<br />Week 7: Other motion planning algorithms<br />Week 8: Rigid-body dynamics<br />Week 9: Robot dynamics I <br />Week 11: Robot dynamics II&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Week 12: Robot control: foundations<br />Week 13: Motion control<br />Week 14: Force/hybrid/impedance control",
