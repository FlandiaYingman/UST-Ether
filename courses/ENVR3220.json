THIS IS AN ECONOMICS COURSE. <br /><br />I specifically asked her if I would be okay taking this course with very little Economics background (this class has no prerequisites, but there should be), and trusted her when she said it would be fine. I WAS WRONG. <br /><br />Both mid-term and final require economic concepts for essay writing and solving mathematical problems:<br />Hotelling rule, marginal cost, prisoner's dilemma, market failure etc. Some of the concepts are not mainstream and will require learning simply for this course (my year four friends with economics major did not know them..) <br /><br />Overall, the content is actually very interesting (esp to ENVR/EVMT students).. however, as our education system tends to, the grading aspect completely ruined the class for me",
            "comment_teaching": "She tries her best to help you understand but honestly if you are not motivated to learn in your own time... good luck. <br /><br />For example, she went through the entire principles of microeconomics in one lesson, and oftentimes it is not substantial enough.",

For the whole semester, there are:<br />- 3 assignments (short and long questions)<br />- Mid-term exam (mostly from her powerpoint)<br />- OPEC Game (this game was very confusing as you have to determine supply of oil every day for 10 consecutive working days; mostly economic problems; at the end you also have to write a group reflection memo)<br />- Final exam (there was adjustment to 24-hr essay questions; there were 2 long essays not more than 800 words each, opinion essay, and some economic knowledge)<br /><br />All in all, the workload is not that much and relatively easy but for assignments you will find hardly the answer from powerpoint.
