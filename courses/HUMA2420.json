Content should be simple if you've taken Chinese history in DSE or if you've studied some Chinese history before.",
            "comment_teaching": "A good professor passionate about history. His view towards history is unconventional and I don't agree to some of his views. However, I appreciate his emphasis on the problems and biases of traditional historical narrative.<br /><br />One thing I don't like about him is his lack of referencing, which is extremely important in the field of history. He would raise many historical evidence in lectures without mentioning where there are from, the credibility of those evidence raised is therefore questionable. We don't even have to cite our historical data in the exam essays, further demonstrating this problem.",
            "comment_grading": "Tutorial 40% (4 x 10%)<br />Final exam 60%<br /><br />Tutorials:<br />There are 4 tutorial sessions, attendance to each session is mandatory. You are expected to read the required readings beforehand and present your views or arguments in the session. There will also be some suggested discussion question posted by Professor Ho so that you can answer the questions in the session. <br /><br />To be honest, the amount of required readings in this course is inadequate for a history course in university. I personally would prefer a longer time of discussion as well since each of us only got around 4 mins due to the limited time.<br /><br />Marks for each sessions: <br />Attendance 2%<br />Performance 8%<br /><br />Final exam: (open book)<br />We have to complete 2 essay questions (out of 4) in 4 hours. You could answer in either Chinese or English. Answers should be typed into a Microsoft word document and uploaded to canvas within the time limit for this online semester. You can exit the zoom session after the first hour of exam. The questions are largely the same with contents in the lecture, so going to lectures will help you a lot in the final exam. <br /><br />I personally added my own point of view with some historical evidence found in the optional reading and my own investigation, apart from the points illustrated in lectures. Overall, I wrote around 4500 words in English. <br /><br />Final grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is small if you only aim for B range, just read the required readings and go to lectures, then you'll be fine.<br /><br />If you want A range, however, much more effort is needed. Read not only the required readings but also the suggested ones, dig up historical evidences and different viewpoints of history from other books by yourself, and most importantly, analyze historical events critically. As a history enthusiast, I found this course rewarding, but you'll probably suffer a lot if you don't like Chinese history, think twice before enrolling this course.",

            "comment_teaching": "個instructor係廈門大學嚟既visiting scholar，應該淨係上呢個summer就走。佢講書都算好，唔會話照PowerPoint讀（PowerPoint其實好少野，多數係佢上堂elaborate）。每個鐘會暫停一次俾大家去下洗手間，所以上堂個pace唔會太快。Tuto係播紀錄片或者同學present，lecture實際既時間2個鐘都無。每日去上當聽故仔。",
