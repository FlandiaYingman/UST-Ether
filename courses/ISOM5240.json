        "description": "Deep Learning (DL) is a promising way for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. It is exceptionally useful for training a large amount of unstructured historical datasets, and predicting the most-likely outputs. DL can be applied in many business areas such as finance, marketing, customer services, information security and so on, and most importantly DL can outperform existing non-AI systems due to the nature of neural networks. This course intends to introduce Python programming language for developing DL business applications. Students will apply knowledge in current and future trends of DL to design DL business applications.",
