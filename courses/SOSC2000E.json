        "description": "The new tri-modal learning approach adopted by the University emphasizes practical and experiential learning. In keeping with that emphasis, this course is designed to let students learn through hands-on involvement in a community or social service project. Students will form groups and collaborate with a local NGO or CBO (community-based organization) to design, plan and implement a community/social service project. They will be urged to think creatively about designing solutions to local problems and helping underprivileged groups. At the end of the course, students will reflect on the lessons learnt from their activity and on how this has influenced their growth as individuals and citizens. The course is intended to encourage students to get involved with and actively contribute to the communities they live in. Students who are passionate about a particular cause - be it environmental pollution, helping disadvantaged minorities or caring for the elderly - can form their own groups to work on related projects.",
