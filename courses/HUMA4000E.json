        "description": "From Pearl Buck's The Good Earth to Edgar Snow's Red Star Over China in early 20th century, from Martin Jacques' provocative claim in When China Rules the World to Henry Kissinger's memoir On China, China has always been a major subject of inquiries for foreigners throughout modern history. Given the growing \"China fever\" nowadays and the rising global attention on China as the next superpower, this course aims to explore China \"in and through foreigners' eyes\" by undergoing an in-depth examination of the variety of writings and observations by foreign individuals across different fields and disciplines from early 20th century to now.",
