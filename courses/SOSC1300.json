Political power,authority, and the state<br />3. Democracy and political obligation<br />4. Freedom and justice<br />5. Traditional ideologies<br />6. Contemporary ideologies<br />--&gt;mid term<br />7. Laws, constitutions, and federalism<br />8. Votes, elections, legislatures, and legislators<br />9. Political parties<br />10. Executives, bureaucracies, policy studies, and governance<br />11. Civil society, interest groups, and the media<br />12. Democracies, democratization, and authoritarian regimes<br /><br />不過今年好似冇左一課，prof話d人寫SFQ話太chur，所以斬左個課",

Individual essay (30%)<br />4. Pop quizzes(好似4個) (as class participation) (10%) <br /><br />我上個時test1就above mean dd，然後test2就below mean dd，essay分最後冇出到，pop quizzes走左1個。最後應該都係踩mean左右，都有B+，所以如果大家GPA遇上危機，請即上summer sosc1300，應該都輕鬆b range<br /><br />順便講下個Individual essay，不得不提個course真係世界級，一開始已經比曬topic，仲要prof講明曬textbook有呢堆topic嘅point，即係換言之你只要抄返落去，再加少少例子已經交得。佢仲要怕人懶，直接cap埋個頁放上canvas比人睇。而且就算真係最後諗唔到點寫，你落堂去搵james，佢會幫你睇份文d論點合唔合理，叫你去搵例子。總而言之，essay冇可能炒，除非你人又唔肯搵，canvas都唔睇(咁抵你死啦)<br />pop quiz就只係對堂上d反思問題打返自己意見咁，不過 d MC就會問返notes入面d野，可以比自己清下concept咁<br />test (mid term,final)分做2part，前面係MC問notes入面d野，後面就係SQ(4揀3)，MC個part，james係test前一堂會放勁多料比你，對準個topic溫應該冇死，SQ就最緊要揀最有信心個d(我呢d冇睇過case study就絕對唔會揀個d題)，james會間接講個topic邊度最重要，咁個度九成都會係SQ見到。",

You might have different expectations when you enrolled, i know i have, but it won't be a problem.",

He speaks at an appropriate pace, and most of his words are just elaborations of whats already in the PPT to help you understand.<br /><br />He also made the lecture more interactive, event though it's difficult through zoom. That includes asking questions, discussion breakout rooms, games, and polls. In my opinion, it was fun.",

Also, she really tries to make an interactive class environment by suggesting questions regarding the class topic to discuss with other peers. <br /><br />Politics is a very subjective topic to discuss and it is often very hard to conceal a person's stance towards a specific political issue. I could see that Prof. Keller trying not to talk about her political views during class. Instead, she wanted to present various alternative views on a certain topic to us, which I thought was very appropriate for a politics professor to do in class.",

If you have any problem with fluently speaking English or speaking publicly, I will not suggest you this course since it's going to grade you accodring to how frequently you speak in class. <br /><br />The weekly tests are not that hard. Just meticulously go over lecture notes/presentation, that's the only thing you need to prepare weekly tests. <br /><br />For the group project, I had four people in my team, but two of them were free-riders and I think I did almost 70% of the work. I couldn't appeal to Prof. about that because the class turned to online mode in the middle of semester, but I still got A-.

            "comment_teaching": "Teaching was only OK, professor Keller explained her ideas clearly, with good examples to illustrate the points, powerpoints are simple but made well and clear which helps a lot with studying for the quizzes. Lectures are mandatory because there are both in class quizzes on readings and mini exams on lecture contents.<br /><br />Personally speaking it was a bit boring but that has more to do with the course content, not the teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "Mini-exams: 30%<br />10 exams in total, each covering 2 lectures worth of content, quite easy and if you have read the readings and looked at the powerpoint even just a little bit before the exam you can do well.<br /><br />Suggesting exam questions: 10%<br />Suggest 2 questions that may be used in the mini-exams, questions were based on the course content of the week.<br /><br />In-class participation: 10%<br />As the name suggests, just be active in the chat and talk more, despite being worth 10% the chat is surprisingly inactive.<br /><br />News: 10%<br />At the beginning of the semester you are asked to choose 3 countries that you will research the politics on, and after that you find 2 articles from the news media in that country that relates to the course content.<br /><br />Presentation: 20%<br />Make a 10 minute video discussing the most important political question in the country you are assigned to, work in groups of 6.<br /><br />Memo on the government of your choice: 20%<br />1 page long memo of the aforementioned presentation, needs to include feedback given by the professor.<br /><br />Bonus: 5%<br />in-class quizzes based on the readings.<br /><br />Mean marks:<br />mini-exams: 21/30%<br />suggesting exam questions: 8/10%<br />news: 8.73/10%<br />participation: 9.03/10%<br />presentation: 16/20%<br />memo: 17.9/20%<br />Bonus: 3.3/5%<br /><br />With these EXTREMELY high means given by the lenience of the grading, EVERY little percent matters, therefore if you aim for a good grade, you MUST do well on the bonus, study for the mini-exams, and be active in chat, and most importantly pray to whatever religious figure that you get good groupmates.<br /><br />God was not on my side, giving me quite incompetent groupmates, meaning that I got below mean in both the memo and the presentation, but because the grading is so lenient, it is only -2% in the final grade, as I performed well in other areas, I ended up with a 91.6/100%, 8% higher than the mean, netting me a grade of A-, which was on the poor side as I expected an A...",
            "comment_workload": "Rated at B, but is actually B- to a C+ as workload is heavy for a common core, 1000-level course.<br /><br />Readings are necessary if you want the 5% bonus marks, and instead of interesting, political philosophy that you may expect and want from a course titled &quot;politics&quot;, the actual readings are quite boring, and often focus on the details and statistics. There are a few good readings, such as Mill, Montesquieu and so on, but most are quite boring. Most people seem to not read them aswell. Meaning you could get an advantage over others for very little work, even if its 1-2% over grades.<br /><br />As for the mini-exams, they are quite easy and only takes around half an hour or so of studying to do well in, since each exam covers 2 lectures.<br /><br />On group projects, working in groups of 6 means that you have to work with others, and cannot &quot;carry&quot; the entire group given that its a 10 minute long presentation. That means you are simply at the mercy of the competence of your groupmates, if you get bad groupmates who don't help, this will be quite difficult as you either have to suffer a bad grade, OR help them fix their poorly made parts. This applies to both the memo AND the presentation (40% of grade!), so workload could fluctuate greatly depending on your luck.<br /><br />News and suggesting exam questions: just 15 minutes per week going on news sites or looking at notes to think of a question, not hard.<br /><br />Again, this course focuses more on the practical side of politics, if you are interested in politics as in the philosophy (or more relevant to the current situation), look elsewhere such as SOSC1661, or if you want to have a better time studying this, wait until James is teaching that semester.",

It provides ground for the latter discussion.<br />The second part is comparative politics, where political systems between different nations is compared.<br />The professor was also kind enough to spare the last lecture to discuss international relationship, which was very helpful.<br />It is definitely rewarding for those who are interested in political/ social science.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Wong was very clear in illustrating the complex ideas by combing real life examples. Even though each lecture lasted for about three hours, it was not boring or tiring. <br />The material is also very illustrative and shows the reference very clearly, which does a great help if you wish to do some further reading.",
            "comment_grading": "Three as hoc assignments and each takes up 5 points.<br />Two essays, each counts for 35points<br />Two social media post, each counts for 15 points<br />Got 92.5/100 and final grade was A<br />It was very surprising as I always thought I was bad at writing",
            "comment_workload": "Fine.<br />I suggest taking this course in summer if you are not very confident in writing, since there is no exam and you have more time to do research and modification to your essays. <br />Mind that you only have 24 hrs to complete each ad hoc assignment and 3 days to complete each essay. It can be a bit intense if you are not very comfortable with reading academic papers and writing in academic language. However, the process of researching and reading itself is quite rewarding and in my opinion it is one of the best part of this course.",

I guess it is more important for students to show their understanding towards the topics and try to make use of the evidence and examples they have observed in the real world (i.e. not just analysing and rephrasing the theories which have been explained super clearly in the lessons). For the essays, maybe students should be more careful about their writing styles and the organisation of the work.",

I especially appreciate it when she included texts that are related to politics written by prominent scholars as readings (like Max Weber, Adam Przeworski, John Stuart Mill and Benedict Anderson). They may be quite difficult, but they provide insight. Prof. would explain them after the iPRS questions are raised. <br /><br />Sometimes the progress in lessons gets a little too slow as there are quite a lot of iPRS questions and loads of enquiries raised by classmates, which she had to carry the previous theme into the next lecture and cut down the content. <br /><br />She really welcomes questions though, and she would reply to anything being asked in lectures or on the CANVAS discussion board.",

Just make sure you have responsible groupmates. <br /><br />The exam is straightforward (just recalling concepts and definitions), combining T/F questions and short questions. Remember to jot down the iPRS questions, it would be useful for the exam as it includes the essence of the readings.

The flow of teaching is very clear and nothing is too hard . <br />There’s also a project in which you find a country and its issue and create a memo on it . The project part is ok as she’ll provide guidance for you but beware of free riders and stubborn group mates .",

She’s also very clear with her ppt and the content , as well as answering peoples additional questions which might take up half of the lesson time in total . She’s also willing to answer peoples questions in canvas for participation points if you’re too shy to speak in class .",
            "comment_grading": "She’s lenient with deadlines and can consult her before you hand in final project . Mini quizzes are quite short and open book , but will still have to study beforehand as each quiz is only 10 mins and often times you can barely finish it . <br />As each quiz is quite short , every question matter . Some questions are quite tricky and only talked about during lessons and not in ppt .",
            "comment_workload": "Project and mini quiz every week . And also reading that’s quite hard to understand , you will definitely have to sit next to some good people and ask for their answers in order to get good grades for additional reading mini quiz .",

If James goes over a concept twice in different lectures I'd probably take that down as something that'll definitely come up in the final.<br /><br />If you do all the readings and understand all the lecture slides you'll probably be good at this course. Not extremely difficult content as this is only poli sci 101.",
            "comment_teaching": "Kinda boring, a lot of the time he just goes over what's written in the lecture slides so there's no real value in sitting in the lecture unless you want to ask him questions in the lecture. (I would go early if you ask questions or at the end of class as he will explain your question very thoroughly and this may result in class going over time)",
            "comment_grading": "James is really fair and transparent with his grading and if you think something is wrong with your paper he'll take time to explain to you why your answer doesn't reach the grade boundary you wanted it to reach. <br />Personally, I would recommend going to every session as sometimes the MCQs are weirdly marked and you might want to double check whether or not it's your misunderstanding or that you can receive credit for your answer.",
            "comment_workload": "Only one essay and it's not in a group project. 1000 words so it's doable in 6 hours and still can receive a high grade for it. <br /><br />You should do some of the readings before class, so that you understand the lecture better as James when he's bored will cold call on people who he thinks aren't listening in the lecture.",
