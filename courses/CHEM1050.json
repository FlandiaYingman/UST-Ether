Lab technicians are glad to answer the questions, if you meet the right one. I once met a pretty girl in this course, but this chance does not belong to me...<br /><br />REMEMBER TO TELL THE LAB TECHNICIANS THAT YOU HAVE FINISHED THE LAB AND ASK THEM TO CHECK OUT!!!<br /><br />If you didn't do so, your marks on lab report ( the 40% one) will be deducted.",
