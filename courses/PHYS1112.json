Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. Students without the physics prerequisite but who have taken PHYS 1101 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but who have taken MATH 1012/ MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.",

            "comment_teaching": "教學包括 lectures 同 tutorials。<br /><br />Lectures 一般唔計 attendance 可以隨便走堂 / 換另一個 professor 嘅 section 上（但係強烈唔建議走堂）。Lectures 主要係教公式嘅推導過程，同埋更加重要嘅係唔同公式背後嘅 physical meaning。由於考試唔會直接要求我哋推導公式，所以如果跟唔到個推導過程其實問題唔大，但係一定要明唔同公式幾時用、點樣用。<br /><br />但係要留意嘅係 MATH 1 字頭嘅 course 未必足夠應付 lectures 嘅內容，雖然考試唔會需要任何 advanced calculus skills，但係可能出於教學需要平時上堂會加插 partial derivative, vector field, line integral 等等嘅 MATH 2 字頭 course 先會遇到嘅 notation，如果冇上堂嘅話真係會唔知做緊乜。我自己本身讀完 MATH1012 就 reg 咗入嚟，一開始就發現自己嘅數學底係唔夠嘅，vector 拆開成 unit vectors î 同 ĵ 對我嚟講已經係新嘢嚟，再加上一 D advanced 嘅 math concept 我上堂有少少難跟。不過大可以放心，calculus 呢個位唔會考得好深入，一般嗰兩個 tests 10 題只會有 1 題係牽涉到 calculus，同埋同 MATH course 唔同，MATH 可能會牽涉複雜嘅運算，PHYS 最重要係識得辨認題目嘅 setting，列好條 function，你只要列好晒 D 式下面就會好順利。<br /><br />Lecturer 方面 Sheng Ping 我會俾 E。Sheng Ping 係大陸 professor 嚟，個人認為佢教得又慢又悶，同冇上冇分別。上咗幾堂我覺得唔對路，結果之後我上晒另外 Cheung Man Fung 果個 section，應該大家都知佢教得好好啦，同埋佢個 look 喺大學 professor 嚟講算高汁 ^_^ ♥♥♥ 不過我有 frd 覺得 Cheung Man Fung 上堂講解太過 mathematically dependent，數學底唔夠好嘅話會好吃力；相反 Sheng Ping 嘅教法會比較易入手 D。我只可以話唔同人各有所好啦，我嘅睇法都唔可以作準。<br /><br />至於 tutorial，據我所知唔同人 hold 有唔同嘅 attendance requirements。我個 section 係 Cheung Man Fung hold 嘅就必須上晒，但係其他 sections 我唔太清楚。Cheung Man Fung 嘅tutorial 一般形式係先做基本 exercise 清 concept，多數係冇實數嘅比較題，例如係比較兩件物件喺唔同位置嘅力、速度等等，呢類題目對清 concept 同埋鍛鍊 qualitative thinking 極有幫助。Tutorial 嘅後半部分就用 problem-based learning 嘅模式，我哋分組解決一條比較複雜嘅情境題，因為題目難度都幾高下，正常成個 section 冇邊組可以計得啱，就當係一個 training 啦。<br /><br />因為本身 Cheung Man Fung 真係 hold 得好好，同埋 tutorial 冇得中途比你 walk-in，所以就算需要 full attendance 我都強烈建議 reg 佢個 section。",

You are probably ill-prepared for a Physics course that is oriented around calculus. Things can get really scary really quick here. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm down.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the thing, this amount of calculus involved in this course is really not high. There is almost no chance that you will ever face any difficult calculus problem. Most of the integration/differentiation (If there is any) that you will face are very easy. All you need to do is to set up the equation and you will be fine. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about vectors? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You will encounter most of the vectors in the first few weeks of the course. The rectangular coordinates that you were once familiar with will be changed to vectors, and it can get uncomfortable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But again, the vector calculations in this course are not difficult, and all you have to do is to spend a few hours to understand what the notations mean and you are all set. If you still find it difficult, search youtube for &quot;Organic Chemistry Tutor Vectors&quot;. The video might seem to be very elementary and basic, but that's pretty much all you are ever gonna need! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Still not convinced? In the Midterm/Final Exam this semester, not a single question involve vectors/integration/differentiation calculations (Maybe there was one or two, but I can't remember, so it can't be that bad.. right?)<br /><br />=Contents= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half (Up to the midterm) is basically just a revision of HKDSE Physics. From F=ma all the way to circular motion. The main focus is how to tackle the problems in HKDSE from a calculus perspective. (And also vector notations) You will have plenty of time to practice your calculus and to get comfortable with them. They also introduced the new concept of the moment of inertia, which, is really not that hard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half is different. They will introduce the new concept of Simple harmonic motion and Waves (Which is wayyyy more difficult than DSE waves. Your previous knowledge about wave will not be able to save you in this one).

The problem is, he is very smart, and he assumes that everyone is as smart as him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not super good at Math or Physics, chances are, you will find Cheung Man Fung's lectures very difficult to understand. You are most likely not going to understand a thing in the lectures and it will leave you questioning your life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It's fine. It happens to the best of us.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why his lectures are so difficult to understand is that he spends a lot of time talking about the DERIVATION of the formulas. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to dealing with the exams, there's really no need to understand those derivations (Well.. unless you are aiming for a guaranteed A+ and want to get the highest mark in the whole class... In that case it would be better if you understand the derivations). The reality is, the exam questions don't require you to know how the formulas are derived. You just need to know how to use those formulas and when to use them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I not saying that you should skip all the lectures and ignore the derivation (you can if you want). My recommendation is to try your best to understand the derivations. It is provide you with a slightly better understanding of the topic. If you can't, that's fine. Don't spend too much time in it. The focus is knowing how to use the equations. <br /><br />=Liu Bin= (TA)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Why... Just... why???<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a sh_t teacher. There is no question about it. The students know it, he knows it, we all know it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not try to explain the concept, he does a poor job teaching. No one pays attention in his class. We are just there because we need to take attendance. He is perfectly aware of this. He could not care less. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My advice: Quit trying to be a TA, go do the Physics research that I'm sure he is good at, and learn how to pronounce the word &quot;square&quot;.",

It is multiplied by 1.1, so a 90ish mark will give you a full mark in the final grade. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The workload from the homework is not high. Google is your friend. Slander is also your friend. <br /><br />=Exams= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, the focus is knowing when to use the formula and how to use them. The only way to achieve this is by practicing, a lot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the supplementary exercises on the Mastering Physics Webpage first. Those are the essentials but will not be adequate for you to get a good grade. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a good grade, do the exercise at the end of each chapter of you Pearson textbook. If you don't know how to do them, copy the questions and search them up in google. For 90% of the questions, you can find the full solution in Slander. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The workload is heavy. There is no question about it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the difficulty of the final Exam is not comparable to the midterm. If you are going after an A grade, make sure that you have at least 5 day (No, 3 days are not enough) devoted to PURE practicing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this course is a good chance for you to reflect your life choices, and think about why you didn't get into CUHK when you have the chance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiiii.... the sweet sweet taste of regret. <br /><br />-Saber Athena",

But, The syllabus includes a lot of unfamiliar constant and symbol. I believe more than&nbsp;&nbsp;90% of students cannot fully understand the topics. But still, even you cannot fully understand the contents, you can still get quite a high grade in the final. The lectures emphasis on the prove of equations, but in the tests and final, they are more about examples. the final have somehow more conceptual questions compared to the tests. But only a quarter of them are these kind of difficult questions. So you may spend more time in the practical questions in mastering physics before test and final.",

In my opinion, I think it is better to put more effort in introducing the examples instead of proving the equations since most of us cannot understand how the&nbsp;&nbsp;equations come. Doing more practices may be better for helping us to clarify the concept.",

This course is the very first course he taught in HKUST. Before he entered HKUST, he finished his undergraduate degree in the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and his doctorate degree in Harvard University. Before he came to here, he has been a Pappalardo Postdoctoral Fellow in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)&nbsp;&nbsp;for three years.<br /><br />Given his outstanding achievement background, his teaching was no doubt very well as he passionately wanted to help us to grasp all the knowledge of Physics despite this was a tough course for all freshmen like me and other classmates. He tried to answer all questions raised by us both during the class and after the lessons. I remembered a few classmates and me has asked him for over an hour after classes (Please note that this period should be lunch time for all of us), and still he was willing to answer all our enquiries and all of us could really understand all the difficult concepts. I have also asked some questions through emails and he could answer all of them clearly within a few hours. <br /><br />For the in-class teaching, due to the extremely massive amount of things we need to learn in this course, he had no choice but had to cram all things into our brains, but still, I could feel that he was trying his best to let us understand all of them in a very short time. You can still take a look at his hand-written notes after the lessons as he would always upload them on Canvas.<br /><br />For the TA, my TA was called Top Archie Dela Peña. He was a Filipino. Please bear in mind that sometimes his accent was a little bit unclear, so you might not be able to get what he said initially. He was not that good at helping us to learn the things as you know, the tutorial session was only 50 minutes, which was totally not enough. However, you may ask him through emails as he could answer my questions quite clear and detailed.<br /><br />You can see more information about my TA in the following website:<br /><br />https://tadppublic.wixsite.com/my-site",

The same textbook and license can be used in PHYS1114, so no additional cost if you take it in the next semester.)<br /><br />About half of the content is included in DSE Physics, but never think that you can rely on your previous knowledge. You will NOT survive. Calculus is required sometimes, but not so frequent. Most of the problems you will encounter are just formula-using type, although there are many formulas which can confuse you.<br /><br />To be honest, this course is very tough. Many physics concepts are introduced in a relatively fast pace, and if your physics background is not solid, you may find it hard to follow (especially for rigid body and thermodynamics). The ability to derive algebraic formulas in complicated situations is also very important (e.g. derive the formula for energy loss in completely inelastic collision), as you may consider preparing a formula sheet for exam (online exam mode).",

Some questions may be difficult, but most of them just require you to be super careful. Each incorrect submission would deduce some marks, so you have to double check each answer if you aim a high grade.<br /><br />Attendance on tutorials counts to your grade, so remember to be present. As we have lesson on Zoom, attendance mark will only be counted if we can answer a super easy MC question correctly. It is just for testing if you are actually paying attention.<br /><br />Mid-term exam coverage are mostly overlapping with DSE. However, almost all questions cannot be answered by using DSE knowledge only. Never think that you can rely on your previous knowledge. Questions are in fact not difficult, but the time allowed is very limited. I prepared a formula sheet for exam, and found it quite effective. But doing this can be time-consuming. Final exam covers all topics (except entropy), but the difficulty is slightly lower than mid-term. Again, preparing a formula beforehand sheet is very useful.<br /><br />In fact the mid-term and final are straightforward, but time allowed is quite insufficient. Thus the mean score is very low. By preparing a formula sheet for both mid-term and final, I managed to get a high score, and turns out got an A+.

But make sure you understand them before exams.<br /><br />There are also some additional exercise not does not count towards the grade. I personally did them just before the mid-term or final. <br /><br />Another workload comes from preparing the formula sheet, which I do it when finishing the homework and additional exercise. Actually the homework is more difficult than exams, so if you can understand them well and give the explicit formula for the questions, you will be able to manage the exams.<br /><br />In conclusion, the workload depends the grade you aim at.",

            "comment_content": "This course covers mostly mechanics, some about waves and thermodynamics. If you have good understanding of physics learnt in high school/ DSE, this course should be very easy for you as most of the topics are just the extensions of those covered in the DSE.<br /><br />As the topics are not really complicated, reading the lecture notes alone could already help you understand the contents. Doing the exercise in Mastering Physics is the key. Even if you do not attend the lectures, you can still get good grades by completing all the exercises in Mastering Physics. <br /><br />I didn't attend lectures. I read the lecture notes while doing the weekly assignment, which basically consists of questions extracted from Mastering Physics. Before the mid-term and final exams, I completed all odd numbered questions in the thick book Mastering Physics as it only has answers to the odd numbered ones. Although you are not required to do crazy maths to derive the provided equations/formulae, it is a good practice to try to derive them yourself to test your understanding. I sometimes went to the weekly Helpdesk session to ask the TA some problems in homework/ Mastering Physics that I couldn't solve.<br /><br />For the content, make sure you understand how everything works. Do not just memorise the formula. Don't worry if you did not study m2 in high school as the maths required are not complex and most of the time you only need basic differentiation/integration.<br /><br />Scores:<br />Mid-term: 27/30<br />Mean: 18.5<br />SD: 5.5 (above mean 1.55 sd)<br /><br />(Online )Final: 32.5/40<br />Mean: 20.7<br />SD: 6.3 (above mean 1.87 sd)<br /><br />Final grade: A+<br />I got 5* in HKDSE physics FYI.",

Sometimes he uses his own pattern instead of just following the lecture notes for explanations. <br />One thing is that the derivations and proofs are not useful if you just want to tackle the exams, as those are for deeper understanding of concepts. <br /><br />Experiment will be done to have visual understanding of concepts.<br /><br />He is also willing to answer your questions after the lecture. You can also ask him for MasteringPhysics and he can teach you to solve the problems<br /><br />Tutorial:<br />留意番tutorial有2種方式，教法好似都有唔同。<br />My tutorial is optional for attendance. Some questions which are similar with those of MasteringPhysics will be done each time. The tutor will then use some time to explain the way of solving the problems. <br />But because of lacking of time, he can only use fast pace to do so, and it may not be easy to understand.

            "comment_teaching": "The instructor is very NICE!!!!<br /><br />He is very clear about what he is saying and his writing is explict--as eveyony knows, writing style sometimes determines whether you wanna have a look at the whiteboard in class and have a further thinking about the knowledge while you're a bit confused, so it helps!<br /><br />Besides, this instructor replies emails in extremely details!!!! Even though the reply is not that timely, you won't get any angry as long as you see his logical explanation with examples :))))",
            "comment_grading": "the grading is good as long as you keep focused on what he is saying in class or if you're mainland student and have a rather strong command of physics in high school then you can directly skip all the lectures and the only thingh you need to do is getting through the lecture notes online and reviewing some classic physics models which we had already met and known very well in high school time, and then you can get good grades. but also NOTE that Tutorial is a must!!!!<br /><br />2 quizzes (each contains 10 questions, which can be very easy and many people get 9 or 10, you just need to be careful.)<br /><br />1 final exam (40 or 45 questions in total i forgot sorry.......can be a little bit difficult since you need to apply various concepts within a not long period of time, get familiar and then you can make it!!)<br /><br />attendence in tutorial (just follow what the TAs tell you to do, practice question is not hard as long as you do not rely on others--you teammates)",

So... he's not that bad??<br /><br />Contrary to the overwhelmingly good comments on the TAs, by all means I must give bad comment on my TA, Hailin Yuan. Not only the questions he give are superficially easy (and without further harder questions), his English speaking is also terrible, probably the crappiest lecturer in terms of English-speaking I've seen in UST for my first semester. Moreover, he just shows the answer of tutorial questions in assignments without much explanation: there's only a few tutorials where he gives time for us to solve tutorial questions before he shows and &quot;explains&quot; them (Before I screenshot them for further reference, LOL).<br /><br />Also did I mention I have COMP1022P lab section 10 minutes later after his tutorial?

There's also a email Q&amp;A running on weekdays, but my opinion is that the email Q&amp;A is less useful than the help desk session.<br /><br />Harder supplementary assignments are also available, and personally, they should be attempted (by all means) to increase your understanding.

It's a lot of content for people with no background, but with effort you can pass this course.<br /><br />For detailed syllabus check other reviews.",

Spend about an hour or two every week watching their videos and you will not suffer as much.<br /><br />If you do know DSE physics (Then why are you reading this?) The lectures are fantastic, professor Leung explains concepts very well, lessons are interactive, and he even does live demonstrations over Zoom which is incredible. But again, he expects you to already know DSE physics, so if you didn't take it in high school, no point in attending.",

He is the youngest instructor among the teaching team of PHYS 1112 (should be a young man around 30), very responsible and well-prepared for every lecture, tests and exams as a course coordinator. <br /><br />Dr. Cheung prepares his own notes in addition to the formal lecture notes (prepared by the Physics Department which I find useless). Before every lecture, he upload his notes on Canvas for students to review. During lectures, he introduces what we are supposed to understand for every topic and explain concepts well in a logical and rational manner. Every single formula and equation required in each chapter are derived in detail, which is easy to follow and noticeable. He explains the key concepts in calculus approach and in verbal sense, formulating a clear picture for each section. He makes lectures interesting and interactive by raising questions and mentioning how these concepts can be applied in our daily life. I have seen some students (especially the foreign students) often respond his questions and raise useful questions) , making lectures more exciting and rewarding. To facilitate learning, demonstrations and experiments are prepared, which are interesting and funny :) I really look forward to attending his class :)<br /><br />Prof. Leung substituted one of the lectures, he is the vice dean of the Science School and also having long teaching experience. His teaching is more like stick to the formal lecture notes but still explain things logical. He hates students using electronic devices during classes and always asks&nbsp;&nbsp;students to response his questions. He likes making a metaphor, saying that all these knowledge covered in this course are easy to handle, &quot; You learnt it in kindergarten :) &quot;<br /><br />Comparing the two instructors, I prefer Dr. Cheung more than Prof. Leung, since he is well-prepared and always ready to make useful responses for any matters in this course.

If you prepare well, getting 7 marks should not be a difficult task. <br />You can make a retest after the first attempt to get a chance scoring higher or simply have more opportunities drilling the questions. <br /><br />Final Exam: <br />The Final covers all topics in this course which is very demanding with very abundant concepts. I strongly advise students to prepare the exam as early as possible. Working on the exercises, past paper and understand the key concepts is a must ! <br /><br />The final consists of 45 MC questions with varying difficulty for different questions. About half of the questions are thermodynamics which require you to work on multiple steps and calculate carefully. Some questions ask the definitions of different principles and equations. <br /><br />The questions covering Waves and Simple Harmonic Motion can be very difficult, you need to sketch the waveform and identify the multiple usage of equations to obtain the answers. The Mechanics problems, I would say some are easy and some requires you to think carefully before answering. <br /><br />My score (scaled)<br />Assignment: 10/10<br />Tutorials: 5/5<br />Test 1: 7.72/10<br />Test 2: 8.73/10<br />Final: 32/45 <br />Overall: 80% <br />Final grade is A-. <br /><br />I strongly advise students to enroll in this course in Fall rather than Spring, the grading in Fall is better and students are generally locals and internationals. Those science students who are required to meet the school requirement, please take this course in Fall if you took DSE Physics. Don't let yourself to be a stupid guy taking those LIFS and CHEM courses you are not familiar with, those will harm your GPA.",
            "comment_workload": "This course requires you to be a very hardworking person with good understanding of the content for every chapter and good time management for preparing frequent exams, finishing weekly Masturbating Physics and attending the tutorials which I find completely useless and wasting my precious time, as well as spending extra time reading textbook&nbsp;&nbsp;and drilling additional exercises. <br /><br />Homework: <br />You are required to purchase the &quot;University Physics&quot; textbook on Day 1 of the semester at the bookstore in order to obtain an access code for the &quot;Mastering Physics&quot; online assignment system. Assignments are offered weekly and questions provided cover the topics learnt in previous lectures. Each assignment include around 10 questions and take really long time to finish, since you need to first understand the concepts and read the examples, then apply them to the exercises. The assignment system makes everyone exhausted because students received questions with different numbers and the answers vary among students. There's a penalty system for answering wrong, usually 10% mark deduction, so make sure you check your answers and steps before entering the numbers and signs. So, find your friends to work on the assignments together. A warm reminder is that make sure you complete your assignments on time and score more than 90% for each task, to ensure a full mark (10%) for the overall assignment grading.<br /><br />Tutorials: <br />You are required to attend the tutorials weekly except the test week. Every tutorials take attendance and contribute 5% of the course grade. My tutorials are boring and useless. People wait for PRS taking attendance, and wait for the TA to explain some of the assignment questions, which I find time-consuming. <br /><br />Advice for revision and preparation of exams and tests:<br /> <br />*READ THE TEXTBOOK AND THE NOTES <br />They are the most useful sources of this course, covering all the concepts you should understand and get familiar with. Calculations and examples are very useful for understanding the concepts and please read every single word of the textbook in detail and make some key notes and reminders for yourself. <br />After understanding the deviation and proofs of the equations, use it often and understand the meaning of each symbols and their units conversion. <br /><br />* WORK ON TEXTBOOK EXERCISES AND PAST PAPER <br />The assignment questions are NOT ENOUGH AND ONLY COVER SOME PARTS OF EVERY CHAPTER. <br />To get familiar with the key concepts and calculations, work on the exercises at the end of each chapter, calculations and graphical drawings are required in this course. I strongly recommend students work more further problems on thermodynamics which cover about half of the final exam paper. <br /><br />Being a student who only received a Level-4 in DSE Physics, I strongly advise students who are not smart but diligent and hardworking to spend more time on this course, hard work really pays off for this course :) Since topics are the solid foundations for further studies in engineering and physics.",

The content will usually become very difficult in the second part of the topic, consisting more concepts, new methods and difficulties.<br />Also the topics in a semester is not really related, from gravitation to force and motion and to gas.

If you do them wrongly, you would get 0 mark for that part and no more attempt is allowed!!!!!<br /><br />I always stuck at those questions that I did wrongly for the first attempt so I took a lot of time to finish. Remember to check carefully when you submit the answers.<br /><br />There is also a dynamic study module that can give you bonus mark that contribute to homework if you complete 8 topics. I did that too.<br /><br />As for revision for exams, It is a nightmare to memorize a large amount of formulae and do practices. There are 3 online practice exams in https://lon-capa.phys.ust.hk/ each for midterm and final exam but they are released only 1 week before the exam. Since I was afraid of getting C, I worked hard and finished all practice exams before the real exams. However, for the online practice exams, after finishing them,&nbsp;&nbsp;there were no steps from question 20 to 40 so I found it super difficult to study some topic especially thermodynamics. <br /><br />Tips: <br />1) clear concepts especially in thermodynamic 1&amp;2<br />2) In the second half, gravitation and doppler effect are relatively easier topic so make sure you can master them<br />3) memorize equations especially in periodic motion, wave motion<br /><br />Basically not only do you need to study hard but also some luck in the exam since they are all mc questions.",

An assignment takes about 2-4 hours to complete. There are also supplementary problems for you to practice but are not counted in final grades. I would recommend you complete all the exercises given every week and the practice exams to get you to familiarise yourself with different types of questions and ways to answer the questions.",

The difficultly lies in the calculus that is used for equations. <br /><br /><br /><br />PHYS 1112 target students who have learned the most basic knowledge in physics in high school. Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. Students without the physics prerequisite but who have taken PHYS 1101 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but who have taken MATH 1012/ MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.",

It is challenging to keep up with the pace of the course since the heavy content is squeezed to only a small time frame.

Apart from learning differentiation and integration, I have no idea about other calculus concepts like the Taylor series in SHM or partial derivatives in energy. Luckily, not a lot of calculus concepts are asked in the mid-term and final. The exam mainly includes physics concepts, so don't worry too much about the math. The math just enables you to understand the physics concepts well",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Cheung has good teaching, which was mentioned in previous reviews. One of the good things is he has hand-written notes. His handwriting and notes are also clear and very easy to understand. Besides, he used a lot of math proof to make us understand more about the physics concepts, which is quite interesting indeed. Despite the online semester, Cheung also issued anonymous feedback surveys so as to let students ask questions anonymously about the lecture<br /><br />However, one major drawback is that a lot of calculus (more than any other professors) is used in Cheung's class (knowing differentiation and integration is a MUST). People who didn't take M2 (like me...) must be aware of that <br /><br />PS: The professor teaches well. Yet, concepts like periodic motions and rotational dynamics are quite abstract e.g., the moment of inertia, the manipulation of sine cosine functions. Really suggest you guys to pay more effort and be aware of these two chapters. Besides, 1112 is really a math-based course. If you don't understand the physics behind via math, you may not synchronise with the professor's teachings",

The easiest question in the exam was the hardest question in the homework. That was why we all had a terrible performance in exams.<br /><br /> In my opinion, the extended exercises in the online platform are the most useful help for you. Make sure you understand how to do those homework questions and the extended exercise.

Yet I still appreciate his effort: At least he unexpectedly linked the concepts with our everyday life e.g. angular momentum: Earth's rotation speed will be lowered when glacier melts. <br /><br />TA Li Cheung Shun was excellent in explaining the details/ reviewing concepts. This was significant when evaluating the tutorial exercises, where I could understand the shortcuts of the questions: Only state the variables among different cases while the constant quantities could be ignored. However it was a pity that mid-term and final could not use those tricks as the questions were far from those in tutorials.",
            "comment_grading": "Grades were calculated according to: a) Homework(10%) (use Mastering Physics): There were 11 graded homework. Most of the questions were hard even if you were familiar with the concepts. Search the questions into the Internet and go through the steps, but do not input the answers provided directly because the numbers provided may differ from what Mastering Physics gave. Otherwise you may lose 6% marks of that part per incorrect answer. You may find the answers in some websites and pdf files. Do not underrate its importance as HW may save you from low grades!<br /><br />Here were my homework scores: HW01: 7.88/8 (Mean 7.2/8)<br />HW02: 3.06/8 (Mean 7.2/8)( I got very low marks as I did not realise that I could find the answer on Internet till HW03)<br />HW03: 8.61/9 (Mean 8.2/9)<br />HW04: 10.18/11(Mean 9.9/11)<br />HW05: 8.84/9 (Mean 8.2/9)<br />HW06: 9.82/10(Mean 9.1/10)<br />HW07: 9.65/10 (Mean 9/10)<br />HW08: 7.72/8( Mean 7.2/8)<br />HW09: 10/10 (Mean 8.9/10)<br />HW10: 9.82/10(Mean 9/10)<br />HW11: 7.94/8(Mean 7.1/8)<br /><br />Note that HW12 was not graded.<br /><br />b) Tutorial(5%): Except first tutorial, other 12 you need to attend unless otherwise specified. Yet you may get full marks if you complete all tutorial exercises with relevant calculations or diagrams or keywords written. I suggest you take photo before submitting your tutorial work as you may not get them back after each session for revision. Don't miss any of them!<br /><br />c) Assessments(Mid-term 35%, Final 50%): Do not trust both Sample papers except heat&amp;gas part as the difficulty was much lower than the actual ones. Although they were all MCs( 24 for mid-term and 40 for final), even if you are clear with the concepts,&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the questions( around 60-70%) suck as they involved in numerous variables, realising the relevant plus multiple concepts to the questions or being complicated. Remember not to be too optimistic as you may not be able to know which formula to apply for each questions, especially for mid-term since force &amp; motion has infinite variations and calculus involved. <br /><br />Homework grade: full mark, need to calculate by your self according to the attachment<br />Mid-term grade:9/24<br />Final grade:15/40<br />They were all below mean but I still got B-.<br /><br />Perhaps my high grades in homework saved me haha!<br /><br />For overall performance among students please see the attachments.<br /><br />Oh don't forget to complete Dynamic Study Modules(DSM)(included in Homework(10%). Not only do they clear your concepts but also bonus marks may be given.",
            "comment_workload": "Homework were not difficult if you could find detailed solutions on Internet. It would be disastrous if you try complete them on your own.<br />DSM would ensure you answered those MCs correctly several times for those you got them wrong at first. Therefore you could get full marks for all DSMs if you are patient.<br /><br />If you aim B range, workload should not be heavy as you could secure near mean, given that you have a good mathematical foundation. For A range, you may need to complete Mastering Physics textbook questions( I did not go through it ).<br /><br />Last but not least, review all calculus up to vectors before mid-term as many MCs need calculus to solve (especially MATH1013, which I studied, did not cover it until Nov 2021). My mid-term sucked as a result.",

The course only lightly touches the concepts and equations, so there is a large portion of the textbook which you do not need to read. However, there are more than 20 chapters that you have to study for this course, so it all balances out.<br /><br />Topics include:<br />- Linear Mechanics (Newton's Laws; Energy; Spring)<br />- Rotational Mechanics (Rotational Motion)<br />- Waves (Mechanical; Sound)<br />- Thermodynamics (Heat; Thermal Properties; First Law; Second Law)",
            "comment_teaching": "This lecturer has an acceptable English accent and can speak both Cantonese and Putonghua. <br /><br />I could tell the lecturer has passion in teaching. The lecturer regularly emails students about his ad hoc consultation session periods. Before the mid-term and final exam, the lecturer also sets up extra consultations session periods. He definitely has heart in teaching.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that the lectures are a bit boring, and that the lecturer should focus a bit more on other aspects instead. The lecturer focuses a significant portion of time on explaining how the physics equations are derived, which is rather useless if you simply want to get a good grade.<br /><br />For those who are looking to major in Physics, or simply interested in how the equations are obtained, this lecturer is perfect for you.",

You can use my results and background to get a general idea of the difficulty of the course.<br /><br />Take note that due to COVID, this semester was fully online, so results may vary.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is ridiculous. <br /><br />Each week, the course asks you to finish homework. Each homework consists of 8 to 12 questions. Each question has multiple sub-questions. The system predicts that you use 80-100 minutes to finish the entire set, but I personally took 2-3 hours to finish the homework set if I do it seriously.<br /><br />Thankfully, you can Google the answers to some (not all) questions through copy-and-pasting. Of course, I don't suggest you to do so, as doing/understanding the questions definitely helps you during study. You should only do this trick when you don't have free time.",

Both the quizzes and final only have multiple-choice questions, which is a good thing because you can just guess, but also a bad thing because the questions require a lot of calculations so if you mess up just a little, you lose the entire question.<br />For the final, I only studied thermodynamics and only seriously answered thermodynamics questions; for other questions I just guessed.",

            "comment_content": "Textbook:<br />University Physics by Young and Freedman (14th Edition)<br />(Including access code for Mastering Physics, an online platform for weekly homework)<br />I highly recommend buying the e-book instead of the hard copy. It’s a little bit more expensive, but you can use it for PHYS1114. To be honest, the hard copy is quite heavy.<br /><br />Syllabus (24 lectures):<br />Mechanics (15 lectures)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Newton's laws<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Work, KE and PE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Collision and momentum<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Rotational motion and moment of inertia (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Angular momentum and energy (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Gravitational force and energy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Kepler's laws, apparent weight and black holes (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Simple harmonic motion (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Real pendulum, damped and forced oscillation (*)<br />Waves (2 lectures)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Transverse waves, power and reflection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Standing waves, beating and Doppler effect (*)<br />Thermodynamics (7 lectures)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Thermal expansion and heat (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ideal gas law<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Heat capacity of gas and energy (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- First law of thermodynamics and types of thermodynamics processes (*)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Second law of thermodynamics, engine and refrigerator (*)<br />(*) new topics for DSE students<br /><br /><br />For DSE Physics students:<br />The first half of the course should be rather easy if you have studied physics (I mean seriously) in high school, as most topics about mechanics are already covered in DSE. The first quiz only covers lectures 1-7, up to collision and momentum, all within DSE syllabus. Be careful and you should be able to get a relatively high score. The lecturer will do a lot of integration during lesson to derive and explain some theorem. But no need to worry too much about the derivation because understanding the concepts (when and why to use calculus) is more important. Using only your high school knowledge is enough for most cases in homework or even the quiz.<br />TL;DR: Be relax during lecture and be careful during the quiz<br /><br />The second quiz mainly focuses on rotational motion, gravity and periodic motion, covering lectures 8-15. It is more difficult than the first quiz because these topics are new, and you will need more revision and exercise to absorb the concepts well. You can no longer rely on high school knowledge. I highly recommend you try the supplementary exercises on Mastering Physics if you are aiming high. Although most of them are more difficult than the actual quiz, they will surely help you fully understand all the new concepts and build your confidence.<br />TL;DR: Try supplementary exercise to understand new concepts<br /><br />The final exam is quite challenging I would say. The questions are more difficult than the previous quizzes and you also need to revise all the topics at the same time, including 1/3 of the topics that are not tested before. Questions in the exam are harder than your homework, so you should focus on lectures 16-24. You will need a lot of time/effort to absorb all the concepts without mixing them up. (SHM vs Wave motion, first vs second law of thermodynamics) As I said, I HIGHLY recommend the supplementary exercises on the website. Some of them may be very challenging and some are even out of the exam syllabus, but them will help you learn much more effectively than merely revising the textbook. (Disclaimer: there are TONS of exercises on the website, about 20 long questions per topic. You should plan your time wisely to finish them)<br />TL;DR: DO NOT REVISE AT LAST MINUTE and try to do more supplementary exercises",
            "comment_teaching": "Tian Wen’s lectures are quite enjoyable. Even though he is a little bit clumsy and my section is always lagging behind the other sections, he would still try his best to teach as thoroughly as he can, to make sure students can understand the concepts better. He may not have the best explanation or best presentation I would say, but he would reiterate stuffs from the previous lecture sometimes and he is trying hard to make his lectures easy to follow and understand. And even if you have doubts, if you ask him after the lesson, he is willing to explain again or even rephrase it in various ways to help you.<br /><br />If you often have troubles in understanding the concepts in lectures, maybe you should try reading the textbook before each lecture, it helps a lot. Don’t expect sitting in the lecture without ever studying the notes or textbook will help you absorb all the contents. Notes taking is important.<br /><br />Sometimes he would crack a joke about the concepts he is explaining. Only if you understand the concepts would you understand his jokes. But not all his students appreciate his humour, I think?<br /><br />TL;DR: humorous, helpful and passionate lecturer, but you should also pay effort to learn better",
            "comment_grading": "Grading scheme:<br />Assignments: 10%<br />- Mastering Physics online exercises, ~10 questions every 1-2 weeks. Most of them are relatively easy, but the system is quite tricky to use (buggy I would say) Anyways, no need to be too worried when you get some questions wrong (due to system bugs or not), getting over 90% score in each assignments will give you a full mark in this part, because the final score will be scaled by 10/9. Remember to finish on time.<br /><br />Tutorials: 5%<br />- You need to attend the tutorial lesson of about 1 hour long each week. The tutor would just tell you to finish your homework there. Fortunately, my tutor takes attendance in the middle of each lesson and therefore being late is not catastrophic.<br /><br />Test 1 and 2: 20% each<br />- Each tests consists of 10 mc questions and you need to finish them in an hour in a computer room. The questions are quite easy and the grading scheme is fairly lenient because you can retake each test once, and the system will take the highest score from the following calculation methods:<br />1. First take * 100%<br />2. First take * 50% + second take * 50%<br />3. Second take * 80%<br />At the end of the semester your raw scores will be adjusted according to the difficulty of the questions in your tests, therefore your actual scores should be higher than the raw scores.<br /><br />Final exam: 45%<br />- There are 45 mc questions and you are required to finish them in 3 hours. They all carry equal marks and marks will NOT be deducted for wrong answers. However, the questions are quite hard and you should be careful and well prepared as I said above.<br /><br /><br />Statistics:<br />Test 1 first take (Raw):<br />- Mean: 5.70 / 10<br />- SD: 2.30<br />Test 1 second take (Raw):<br />- Mean: 5.89 / 10<br />- SD: 2.21<br />Test 2 first take (Raw):<br />- Mean: 5.28 / 10<br />- SD: 2.50<br />Test 2 second take (Raw):<br />- Mean: 5.23 / 10<br />- SD: 2.17<br />Final:<br />- Mean: 24.32 / 45<br />- SD: 7.696<br />- Max: 44 / 45<br />- Min: 6 / 45<br /><br />My grade:<br />- Assignments (10%): 10 / 10<br />- Tutorials (5%): 5 / 5<br />- Test 1: 9 / 10<br />- Retake 1: 10 / 10<br />- Adjusted Test 1 (20%): 10 / 10<br />- Test 2: 9 / 10<br />- Retake 2: 9 / 10<br />- Adjusted Test 2 (20%): 9.99 / 10<br />- Final (45%): 43 / 45<br />- Overall: 98.0 / 100&nbsp;&nbsp;(A+)",
            "comment_workload": "The only homework is the online assignments each week. The questions are quite easy and there are only less than 10 questions in each assignment. You should have enough time to finish it in each tutorial session if you understand the basic concepts. Even though the questions are the same for all students, the data in each question is randomly generated for each student. If you want to ask for your friends' help, make sure you plug in your own data.<br /><br />Actually the workload is quite light, however I think most of the students would agree that the Mastering Physics system is not so user-friendly and you should expect some strange answers or some confusing sign conventions appearing in your homework. Very often you will find your answer wrong only because of the &quot;intelligent&quot; design of the system.<br /><br />Another strange policy in this course is that it forces you to attend the tutorials every week, which is a waste of time for most students. The online assignments can be done at home but now they require you to commute to UST every week. I don't quite understand why. For students who are more capable, they may have already finished the work at home, and they will be just siting in the tutorial lesson hanging out with friends. For students who are not so capable, the tutorial session is not long enough for the tutor to help them one by one, while they are struggling with different questions in different sets of homework. But anyways the workload of this course is rather low and okay I would say.<br /><br />TL;DR: Strange homework system and strange tutorial policy, but very light workload",

            "comment_content": "Generally a calculus approach to the topics you've learnt in DSE and also some extra stuff (previously in AL). Content load is about DSE Topics 1~3 + Extra Stuff crammed into a semester<br /><br />===Topics (L = Lecture No.)===<br />L1: Vectors &amp; 2D Motion<br />L2~3: Newton's Laws of Motion<br />L4~5: Kinetic Energy &amp; Potential Energy<br />L6~7: Momentum &amp; Collisions<br />--------------QUIZ 1-----------------<br />L8~10: Dynamics of Rigid Bodies<br />L11: Angular Momentum<br />L12~13: Gravitation<br />L14~15: Periodic Motion<br />--------------QUIZ 2-----------------<br />L16~17: Wave Motion &amp; Sound<br />L18: Temperature &amp; Heat<br />L19~20: Thermal Properties of Matter<br />L21~22: 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics<br /><br />This course will let you re-learn all the stuff from high-school, but with concepts of calculus. You'll see differentiation (including partial derivatives!!) and integration in formulas, and use of cross products. However, you just need simple algebra when dealing with problems. Calculus is only required in derivation of formulas in class and some questions.<br /><br />I think this course is quite good and interesting since it teaches some university foundation physics like thermodynamics (You'll see it everywhere). But if your physics is not too good then probably you wanna avoid this as the questions can get frustrating.<br /><br />I would say this course can be demanding as the content is difficult. If your physics foundation in high school is good, then you should do good :)",
            "comment_teaching": "===General Teaching===<br />Generally I don't really like that this course is deduction-themed. All the professors will spend MOST of the time deducing formulas instead of problem-solving, which is equally important. The deduction part is the MOST difficult among the whole course. But trust me, you can do equally well if you can use the formulas correctly without knowing any deductions.<br /><br />===Professor's Teaching===<br />Professor Jo's teaching is fine. He talks in a rather soft voice which may be hard to listen. His pronunciation is fine, but can be more clear. I literally took 16 lectures to understand a phrase he used always, which is &quot;F equal ma&quot; =_=. He usually have demonstrations in classes but sometimes they fail to work. You can clear some concepts during class as he'll give extra explanation so it's best to attend all classes<br /><br />===TA's Teaching in Tutorials===<br />Yang Shuo (The TA) is literally THE CRAPPIEST TA UST CAN HAVE. He just freaking stands in front of a computer and stares at the screen and teaching NOTHING. Sometimes he'll walk around and stalk behind you. Don't expect to learn anything from him! You need to raise your hand to find him, and sometimes he can't just freaking explain why I did the question wrong.<br /><br />Also, attendance is recorded so there's no escape :)&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear that other TAs are fine and they teach you how to solve questions",

You sit in front of a computer to complete 10 questions for 1 hour. Most of them require you to input a number for answer, and there are around 2~3 MCs. Usually there are 1~2 challenging question that takes you quite some time. Be sure to check for any silly mistakes!<br />Re-take policy - Highest score is recorded from one of following:<br />1. First take<br />2. Average of first and second take<br />3. Second take * 80%<br /><br />===Final (45%)===<br />45 MC questions and CLOSED BOOK. (Have formula sheet provided) It mainly covers the content not covered in tests 1 and 2. Around 40% of questions are related to thermodynamics and gases (L18~22), and they are DIFFICULT. There are 2 questions that require you to derive equations (one using calculus). The professors claimed that they will have 25% questions each for L1~13, L14~17, L18~20 and L21~22 respectively, but there are some deviations from the final paper.<br /><br />===Homework (10%)===<br />You are forced to buy a textbook to obtain licensing key for online homework system &quot;MasteringPhysics&quot;. You need to complete around 6~10 questions EACH WEEK for the topics just have been taught. (Except for the test weeks, they are not graded). I think they will round off your score to 10/10 if you score 9X% in total for your homework. (Someone says your MasteringPhysics score is multiplied 110% to become your final homework score)<br /><br />===Tutorials (5%)===<br />Just show up on time and answer a PRS question. You can leave right after checking attendance (if your TA is shitty lol)<br /><br /><br />I think you need to be hard-working to get good grade (especially do a lot of questions and recite how to approach that question). If you do slightly above mean I think you get B- or B (not really sure)<br /><br />By the way, there's a policy to ban any Mainland students from enrolling this in FALL semester only. So, I think the mean in fall semester is a bit lower.",

The workload mostly come from doing homework and revising for tests and exams (which were held per 3~4 weeks). <br /><br />===Homework===<br />Doing MasteringPhysics is ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING. They deduct 10% mark for every incorrect answer. Sometimes they deduct you marks for something stupid like missing minus sign or slightly off number. The questions are also quite difficult and you need to copy the whole stupid question to Google to find answers. You got to repeat this torture each week :)",

Only in tutorial class can you learn how to apply the knowledge and do the questions. Even so, you are not advised to skip lectures as in the final exam (45 MC, 3 hrs) questions are not similar to those you encountered. Only concepts are related, but not the types of questions, I would say. So, understanding and remembering the fundamental concepts or theories may be very important.",

Calculations may need you more than 5 minutes so that you can ensure your first step is correct. Plus, to the nest of my knowledge, those mechanics problems were mostly akin to those in AL physics. <br /><br />In addition, prior to the final exam, only one past paper will be uploaded to canvas. You had better do it seriously and try to change the question after finishing so as to ensure you can cope with questions with the same topic but different situations. I remembered that in the last lecture the lecturer attempted to explain how to do each question but he failed to do some of them.",

Although some of the questions and their corresponding answers may be found online, answers from the web may not be always true, and wrong answering will cause mark deduction.<br /><br />For those who aim a high grade but have not yet done AL physics MC (mechanics) before, it may be pretty demanding for you as you had better try them as soon as possible so as to get adapted to the way of thinking.",

It is quite hard to understand so I suggest you should do revision every week. The tutorial will count attendance as it will hold 5% of the total marks.

To be honest, I have not used the textbook at all in my learning, so it may be up to you. But I felt that the notes can give you sufficient points to learn the basic concepts of the course. <br /><br />In order to make sure your understanding is actually correct, I think the homework has to be done. MasteringPhysics will also provide extra questions later on in the course to allow you more questions for self practice, and they do NOT count towards your course grading.",

Not easy at all compared to the homework you get. You need to obtain at least 3X out of 45 MCs to obtain a grade above B as far as I know.",

As such, the content would be a little more challenging than its non-calculus based counterpart, phys1111.<br /><br />The structure of this course is well-designed. The first few lectures enabled students to warm up and relearn concepts we should have learnt in high school. After that, the pace became considerably faster as it introduces new concepts such as rigid bodies mechanices, SHM, wave motions, and thermodynamices, none of which is covered in the HKDSE physics curriculum. Despite its fast pacing, the explanations provided by the instructor and the note is clear and one only needs to take his/her time to fully digest it after lectures.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor has a easily-understandable Chinese accent, though it could be a bit strange at times. He seldom follows the lecture notes. Instead, he tends to derive the necessary and important results with his own methods, which in my opinion is more elegant and easier to understand. According to him, our class actually got the highest mean in both Test 1 and Test 2, so that should be a testimony of how good his teaching is.",

However, one can always contact the instructor and the TA of your tutorial session to seek help. One can also just copy the whole question and google it to find solutions available online. Other than that, the workload should be light as one only has to study for test 1, 2, as well as the the final examination, which has the heaviest weighting in score calculation.",

You can't learn anything from the lesson and almost half of the class disappeared after mid september lol. The tutor is a local teaching assistant and he teaches much better than the professor.

There will be 10 assignments in total, one per week. Your mark will be rounded up to 100% automatically if you got more than 90% in one assignment. However, you are searching for the answer in yahoo at most of the time instead of doing it by yourself since it is pretty difficult. Note that you have to purchase the physics textbook in order to get this 10% mark, which costs you 300$ wtf.<br /><br />Both tests consist of 10 questions, one mark each, and 2-3 of them are MC question. Re-take are available for both tests, and the system will take the highest score among three calculating methods as your final score:<br />-Score of first-take<br />-Average score<br />-80% of the second-take score<br /><br />Test 1 covers topic 1-8, which is force and motion. The test is much easier than the assignment. Using the knowledge covered in DSE syllabus helps you to get a satisfactory score. Most of the questions are pretty straight forward solvable with simple equations e.g. mv^2/2=mgh or F=ma<br /><br />Test 2 covers topic 9-15, which covers from rotation to simple harmonic motion. However, you can no longer abuse your knowledge acquired in secondary school to pass the test.<br /><br />Final Exam consists of 45 MC questions and it is cumulative. However, there are questions from lecture 16-24 since it is not covered in the tests. Almost 15-20 questions are about thermodynamics.<br /><br />The grading is okay but not good definitely. For your reference only,<br />Homework: 100/100 (mean:95.1)<br />Test 1: 7/10 (mean: 5.56, sd: 2.44)<br />Test 1 retake: 6/10 (mean: 5.5)<br />Test 2: 6/10 (mean: 5.18, sd: 2.59)<br />Test 2 retake: 7/10 (mean: 5.4)<br />Final exam: 31/45 (mean: 21.8, sd: 7.8)<br /><br />Final grade: B+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is very heavy as it covers many chapters in Physics. It is no longer a matter of putting some unknowns into a suitable equation and hence solve it. I took m1 and physics in HKDSE in got both 5* but it doesn't help me much in this course. At most of the time you are feeling hopeless that you can't even solve for one single question. And there's not much assistance provided except the help desk. The notes is shit and I was learning from the yahoo answer and wondering how the guy get the correct answer. But it takes you many time and eventually you are just memorising all the equations without knowing how to derive it and hope it will work in the examination.<br /><br />However, if you know how to do the MasteringPhysics, then mostly you can get a B range in this course.",

The proof may also be useful as some questions in the exam may require you to do so, even if they are all in MC. <br /><br />It also includes some basic vectors. Even if you have studied M2 before, you have to know how to apply it in Physics so it is not an easy stuff. <br /><br />And as I have said, it include many different topics so you have to keep revising whenever one big topic is finished.<br /><br />But overall, I believed these physics should be the basic things we have to learn. And I did learn something from it.",
            "comment_teaching": "There were 4 lecturers in 17 fall. I attended all of the 4 (if lecture video also count &lt;-- Leung Pak Wo).<br /><br />And the one I was originally attending was Professor Altman lecture. Frankly speaking, quite boring. I understand his passion to make us feel the interest of physics, but the learning style of Hong Kong may not suit his teaching style. He wants an active learning environment that we can't give. So the lecture becomes a bit awkward, and boring when he always try to wake us up, but not teaching.<br /><br />Then I sat Chen Tian Wen lecture. And I stayed for quite a long time. He explained everything so clearly and were very willing to answer our questions after class.<br /><br />As Leung Pak Wo posted up his lecture video on Canvas, I also kind of &quot;attended&quot; his lesson. His explanation was also very clear like Chen Tian Wen. He also gave the answer to questions in the lecture notes while the others might not always do so. But from the lecture video, it is easy to see that he didn't allow anyone using phone or sleeping, which is sth you have to consider if you want to attend his lecture. XD<br /><br />At last, just being curious, I sat in Cheung Man Fung lecture when we started the topic about heat and thermodynamics. He really explained them very clearly and his explanations and examples helped me a lot in this topic.<br /><br />There were also 4 help desk sessions before the final exam and 3 of the lecturers (except Professor Altman) were there to answer your questions. That is very useful and I highly recommend you to go if you have any concept unclear.<br /><br />To sum up, the 3 local lecturers are all very good and you can try by yourselves to find the one suitable for you. For me, I think it should be Cheung Man Fung.",

They do not count into any marks and you can try as many time as possible. They are very good practice and I have spent much time doing almost all of them. It did helped.

            "comment_content": "This is a course for Engineering student admitted into first year and they require some preliminary understanding in Physics. Check the pre-requisite above for the course's requirements. The course syllabus is as follows:<br /><br />- Physics quantity<br />- Newton's Law of Motion<br />- Work and Kinetic Energy<br />- Potential Energy and energy conversion<br />- Momentum, impulse and collision<br />- Dynamics of Rigid Bodies<br />- Angular Momentum<br />- Gravitation<br />- Periodic Motions<br />- Wave motions<br />- Thermal Properties<br />- Thermodynamics<br /><br />If you have the textbook purchased, you will find that for the first few lectures, Dr. CHEN goes over a whole chapter in the book so the content itself might not be well covered. Purchasing the textbook is a must for online homework submission. I don't know much about the DSE syllabus but speaking from the IB graduate's point of view, a lot of the content here has already been slightly covered, especially the Dynamics of Rigid Bodies (Engineering - Option B). This course aims to show how a lot of the formulae in the topics are derived and used from Calculus so I personally don't find it hard to understand the calculus concepts in the course.<br /><br />But, since there are a lot of concepts covered in the course, it might overwhelm you. Think twice before joining the course because there are lot more courses to choose from to satisfy the fundamental courses. I sometimes find it hard to understand the concept and use them efficiently in tests and homework.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. CHEN can sometimes be funny in the lectures. His teaching is clear and he often follows what is on the lecture notes. But, he always does a lot of proofs on the whiteboard and explain how such formula is derived. Although proofs are important for understanding, the final formula are always the ones to remember. There are always demonstrations at the end of the lecture and he's also keen to answer your questions after the lecture ends.",
            "comment_grading": "Course assessment components:<br /><br />- 10% Homework (MasteringPhysics)<br />- 20% First Test (Lectures 1 - 7)<br />- 20% Second Test (Lectures 8 - 15)<br />- 50% Final Exam",
            "comment_workload": "Every week, there is online homework assignment from MasteringPhysics. They are normally due on Sunday and you will be given approximately a week to finish it before the due date. The questions are sometimes hard and require more time to understand and finish. Apart form homework, it's also crucial to understand the lecture content in order to be able to score well in homework and mid-term exams (i.e. two tests). The textbook that we have purchased is somewhat useful when the lecture content is not well covered in the lecture notes.",

Who wants to take four tests in two months when you can get away with two! So be well prepared for the tests.<br /><br />Main part: Do questions after each chapter in the textbook, depending on your time available and what grade you want to have. You do not need to worry about not enough questions, there are like 100 of them per chapter (2000 in total). Do them according to your interest and ability. For me, I have not done any and I am very much prepared and accepted the consequences<br /><br />(btw I don't really know what grade should I give for workload. I will give a B for my personal experience for not doing any extra questions)",

For the tutorial, the problems given are useful and can be used for practice. There are also some PRS questions in class but they are not counted in grade.",

You are probably ill-prepared for a Physics course that is oriented around calculus. Things can get really scary really quick here. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm down.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the thing, this amount of calculus involved in this course is really not high. There is almost no chance that you will ever face any difficult calculus problem. Most of the integration/differentiation (If there is any) that you will face are very easy. All you need to do is to set up the equation and you will be fine. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about vectors? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You will encounter most of the vectors in the first few weeks of the course. The rectangular coordinates that you were once familiar with will be changed to vectors, and it can get uncomfortable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But again, the vector calculations in this course are not difficult, and all you have to do is to spend a few hours to understand what the notations mean and you are all set. If you still find it difficult, search youtube for &quot;Organic Chemistry Tutor Vectors&quot;. The video might seem to be very elementary and basic, but that's pretty much all you are ever gonna need! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Still not convinced? In the Midterm/Final Exam this semester, not a single question involve vectors/integration/differentiation calculations (Maybe there was one or two, but I can't remember, so it can't be that bad.. right?)",
            "comment_teaching": "=Cheung Man Fung= (Professors) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheung Man Fung is really not a bad teacher. The problem is, he is very smart, and he assumes that everyone is as smart as him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not super good at Math or Physics, chances are, you will find Cheung Man Fung's lectures very difficult to understand. You are most likely not going to understand a thing in the lectures and it will leave you questioning your life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It's fine. It happens to the best of us.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why his lectures are so difficult to understand is that he spends a lot of time talking about the DERIVATION of the formulas. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to dealing with the exams, there's really no need to understand those derivations (Well.. unless you are aiming for a guaranteed A+ and want to get the highest mark in the whole class... In that case it would be better if you understand the derivations). The reality is, the exam questions don't require you to know how the formulas are derived. You just need to know how to use those formulas and when to use them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I not saying that you should skip all the lectures and ignore the derivation (you can if you want). My recommendation is to try your best to understand the derivations. It is provide you with a slightly better understanding of the topic. If you can't, that's fine. Don't spend too much time in it. The focus is knowing how to use the equations. <br /><br />=Liu Bin= (TA)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Why... Just... why???<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a sh_t teacher. There is no question about it. The students know it, he knows it, we all know it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not try to explain the concept, he does a poor job teaching. No one pays attention in his class. We are just there because we need to take attendance. He is perfectly aware of this. He could not care less. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My advice: Quit trying to be a TA, go do the Physics research that I'm sure he is good at, and learn how to pronounce the word &quot;square&quot;.",

Slander is also your friend. <br /><br />=Exams= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, the focus is knowing when to use the formula and how to use them.

Those are the essentials but will not be adequate for you to get a good grade. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a good grade, do the exercise at the end of each chapter of you Pearson textbook. If you don't know how to do them, copy the questions and search them up in google. For 90% of the questions, you can find the full solution in Slander. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The workload is heavy. There is no question about it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the difficulty of the final Exam is not comparable to the midterm. If you are going after an A grade, make sure that you have at least 5 day (No, 3 days are not enough) devoted to PURE practicing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this course is a good chance for you to reflect your life choices, and think about why you didn't get into CUHK when you have the chance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiiii.... the sweet sweet taste of regret.",

There's also a email Q&amp;A running on weekdays, but my opinion is that the email Q&amp;A is less useful than the help desk session.<br /><br />Harder supplementary assignments are also available, and personally, they should be attempted (by all means) to increase your understanding.

If you are looking for a high grade, PHYS1112 is a good choice.<br /><br />the final score of the assignment will be multiplied with a factor of 10/9, which means you only need to score 90/100 to get the full mark.",
            "comment_workload": "I give it a C because the homework system is so annoying. I can hardly believe that a system that costs each student hundreds of HKD is so slow, time-consuming and out of date. There are on average 9 questions each week and you have to pay extra attention to the rounding, units, up/down case and so on. There will be a deduction for each wrong answer and you will lose all the points after 5 attempts. <br />Go through the lecture notes and supplementary notes several times until you clearly understand the concepts is necessary for a good grade. The lecture notes are a brief summary of the textbook, so there is no need to read the textbook unless you are still confused with some concepts. Homework and supplementary exercise on the homework system are enough. Nothing too hard.",

For a calculus-based physics course, you are probably not well-prepared. Here, things can quickly become extremely ominous.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Settle down.<br /> The amount of calculus required for this course is actually quite low. You have a very slim chance of ever encountering a challenging calculus problem. Mostif there is any, will be very simple in terms of integration and differentiation. You just need to set up the equation, and everything will work out.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What about vectors, then?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few weeks of the course, you will come across the majority of the vectors. You'll be switching from the familiar rectangular coordinates to vectors, which can be unsettling.<br /> But once more, the vector calculations in this course are not challenging; all you need to do is spend a few hours getting to grips with the notations, and you'll be good to go. If you're still having trouble, look up &quot;Organic Chemistry Tutor Vectors&quot; on YouTube. Although the video may appear very simple and straightforward, but that is really all you will ever need!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet persuaded? This semester's midterm and final exams did not contain a single question that required performing calculations involving vectors, integration, or differentiation (I may have missed one or two, but it can't be that bad, can it?).",

Even the best of us experience it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He spends a lot of time discussing the DERIVATION of the formulas, which is the main factor contributing to the difficulty of understanding his lectures.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really no need to comprehend those derivations when dealing with the exams.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(Except if you want to earn the highest grade in the class and are guaranteed an A+; in that case, it would be preferable if you understood the derivations.) In actuality, it's not necessary to understand how the formulas are arrived at to answer the exam questions. You simply need to be aware of how and when to apply those formulas.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not suggesting that you ignore the derivation and skip all the lectures (although you are free to do so). My advice is to make every effort to comprehend the derivations. It will give you a little more insight into the subject. If you are unable to, it's okay. Don't linger there for too long. Understanding how to use the is key. <br />(TA) Liu Bin<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Why... Simply... why?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a terrible educator. There is no disputing it. He knows it, the students know it, and we all know it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He does a poor job of teaching and makes no attempt to explain the idea. Nobody in his class is paying attention. Our only purpose in being there is to take attendance. He fully understands this. He doesn't give a damn.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My recommendation is to stop trying to be a teaching assistant and instead focus on the physics research that I'm sure he is good at. Also, learn how to pronounce the word &quot;square.&quot;",

Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. For students under the 4-year degree only. Students without the physics prerequisite but have taken PHYS 1001 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but have taken MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.",

            "comment_grading": "Exam 題目大部分都好 straight forward (簡單過中學physics lol), 難啲嘅幾條就同 supplementary questions差不多(難過homework)<br /><br />有心讀嘅話其實個course幾有趣，想慳時間可以skip哂formula derivation嘅部分 (coz 唔會考haha)<br /><br />My marks (FYI):<br />Homework score: 9.99/10<br />Tutorial score: 5/5<br />Midterm score: 26/27 (max: 27)<br />Final exam score: 35.5/39 (max: 37)<br />Grade: A+ <br /><br />其實肯認睇下 lecture notes 都唔太難攞靚 grade &gt;v&lt;<br />DSE physics 學得好又有讀 M12 嘅話都幾推薦 take 呢個course做common core !!
