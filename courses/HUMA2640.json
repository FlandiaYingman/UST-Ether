Someone may say professor was trying to teach in depth ma. But&nbsp;&nbsp;in my perspective, professor just used 10 examples to illustrate the same argument in 2/3 lectures... Basically he was stuck in the same content over a week. <br /><br />That is why he can only cover 2 topics (violence and women) more comprehensively. The prostitution, opium and workers, he just rush through all the topic without giving in-depth explanation. <br /><br /><br />USELESS TA...<br />We have tutorial which we were required to share our insight based on the reading material. Tho the professor said that each leader who could first speak up should only make a speech no more than 5 mins. But I saw some of my classmates made a 10 mins, even 15 mins speech. And the TA DID NOT STOP THEM... As a result, ta fail to act as a time keeper. <br /><br />Apart from that, some student may mix up with some concepts. However, the ta never gave them any feedback.",

As you can copy all prof said in your one-page cheat sheet, no need to recite any stuff for the final this time.",

After all leaders' speeches, the remaining students can raise your hands and speak up. Remember you will be graded by your active participation, so RAISE YOUR HAND AND ANSWER IN EVERY SECTION.<br /><br />Examination 60%<br />There will be 4 essay type questions and you have to answer 2 of them. This year we can bring a two sided A4 cheatsheet, and I wrote everything Virgin said during class (probably most of us do so). The exam lasts for 3 hours therefore try to write as much as you can. <br /><br />Overall I got an A-. To be honest I thought I could get an A, but A- is still good for me.",

            "comment_content": "Another side of the modern history of china taught in English but studied in Chinese (you'll need to read a lot of literature).<br /><br />Just as the intro says, this course is all about violence, women, prostitution, the opium war and the 'overexploitation' in China. As he mentioned, if you have enrolled to his previous course (also about China history, but idk which), this course would be nicer. But me as a Yr 1 didn't attend so and without HKDSE ChiHis bg, still think the content is manageable, except for lack of deep understanding on specific topics. It is still meaningful if you just want to make a preliminary step to study ChiHis.",
            "comment_teaching": "Local, talkative prof. and informative class. However, he seems to talk about something (might not be main points or very meaningful, lol) repetitively so he didn't manage to go through all the content on class in this semester. <br /><br />No matter what, we don't have to attend all the lectures this sem due to zoom teaching. I guess when you read enough/ most of the literature, it will be more than enough for you to understand what he wants to express. (but of course, could say his teaching helps you to skip reading some of the literature, so this depends on you).",
            "comment_grading": "What is counted:<br />-Final exam where you write passages on the topics chosen from his question list within ~6 hours<br />-4 discussions(tutorials)<br /><br />attendance is not counted in the % this sem.<br /><br />The grading is fair.",
            "comment_workload": "There are 4 tutorials (replacing one of the lecture) every other week. Each is for you and your classmates to discuss on parts of 2~3 literature (provided by the prof) regarding the course's topic e.g. women. No additional homework is assigned but you of course have to read most of the course material for the tutorial. Try not to spend too much time on delving into some terms (like me LOL), instead, drop down your idea/inspiration/conclusion on some parts of the literature and make sure to understand its overall idea. This is more than enough to prepare for the tutorials and final exam.",
