After the midterm, the course will go through hotelling model and indefinite games nash equilibrium. After that the course will explore some deeper economic chapters such as second price discrimination and product differentiation with pretty much calculations.<br /><br />Below are the chapters:<br /><br /><br /><br />1. Introduction and basic concepts<br />2. Classical oligopoly models <br />3. Dynamics in oligopoly <br />4. Tacit collusion <br />5. Sources of market power<br />6. Product pricing and quality oÂ§er <br />7. Vertically related markets <br /><br />The topics are interesting and understandable. Good for people who like microeconomics as the topics are trying to explain what happened in reality, e.g. how the existence of search cost affect product pricing / how a menu should be designed to allow customers to pick the goods they want according to their own price sensitivity.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is very nice and excellent. The pace is a little bit slow but he can explain the complicated concepts very well. He is also very willing to answer questions from students. You can always follow his pace in the lecture, unlike some other econ prof. who she always like talking to her own. It is pleasant to attend prof. Au's lecture.",

I got B+<br />Midterm: 89/100 (mean 82.7)<br />Hw: 39/40 <br />Final score is not released.<br />I think I performed pretty good in final, at least I have confidence for the 5 questions I completed out of 6<br /><br />He said he gives grade based on effort, and he really did. I made a very careless mistake in my midterm (made a fix cost as a variable cost in the calculation), which made the whole calculation wrong completely. Yet he still provided a high score to me (nearly full marks) for the question because I did nothing wrong beyond that.<br /><br />One point to note for the exams. The professor blended different topics in each question in the final exams. In homework and lectures we were trained to solve a question with that specific type of question, in final exam you use the solving method from another chapter to solve the question that is not related to that chapter. Anyway, the main point is that you have to understand the concept very well&nbsp;&nbsp;and the reason of each step very well to prepare the exam.",

After that new stuff came up, like tacit collusion, product differentiation, consumer inertia and price discrimination. Various models are used to describe different kinds of market structures and situations in the real life, and explain each company's&nbsp;&nbsp;strategies in those cases. Contents are interesting if you like to learn about behaviors between firms and customers using game theory models. Only basic calculus and probability are required.<br /><br />According to the outline, the chapters are:<br /><br />1. Introduction and basic concepts (1 lecture)<br />\u000f Review of perfect competition and monopoly pricing<br />\u000f Measures of market power and welfare<br /><br />2. Classical oligopoly models (3 lectures)<br />\u000f Theory of static games<br />\u000f Static oligopoly models<br /><br />3. Dynamics in oligopoly (4 lectures)<br />\u000f Theory of dynamic games<br />\u000f Dynamic oligopoly models<br />\u000f Business strategies<br /><br />4. Tacit collusion (4 lectures)<br />\u000f Repeated games<br />\u000f Cartels and tacit collusion<br />\u000f Antitrust<br /><br />5. Sources of market power (3 lectures)<br />\u000f Product differentiation<br />\u000f Consumer search<br /><br />6.

Instead of only teaching the mathematical models, he also uses many business cases as examples to show how these models are useful in analyzing the problems and flaws of the simple models. Also, the problems in the problem sets are very well-designed for us to use knowledge learned in the lectures, so by doing homework we can review and extend the contents. He is also open to any questions regarding the materials.<br /><br />The teaching assistant HAO, Yuzhi also did a great job in reviewing the problem sets. He emphasized on the tricky parts of the problems that most of us could make mistakes on and explained it well.",

            "comment_content": "I will put an asterisk for the content which is covered by Econ3133. (I attended Prof. Huang's session)<br />1. Basic (*)<br />Demand and Supply revisit, firm's cost function and maximization problem.<br /><br />2. Static Game (*)<br />Basic Game Theory: Prisoner dilemma; Nash Equilibrium, Profitable Deviation, Best Response function, Random Strategies.<br /><br />3. Static Oligopoly Models (*)<br />Homogenous and differentiated Bertrand; Cournot<br /><br />4. Dynamic Games (*)<br />Backward Induction. Very straight forward.<br /><br />5. Dynamic Oligopoly (*)<br />Stackelberg model; Apply the dynamic game framework into solving firm's profit maximization problem.<br /><br />6. Business Strategies<br />Dynamic Oligopoly but with different kind of investment. How to perform entry deterrence by committing to an investment. Direct effect and Strategic effect.<br /><br />---midterm---<br /><br />7. Repeated Games (* partly)<br />Finitely and infinitely repeated games; Profitable one-shot deviation; Grim Trigger and Less Grim Trigger strategy.<br /><br />8. Tacit Collusion and Antitrust<br />How firms can collude by setting up a punishment mechanism. How could different Antitrust measures reduce the possibility of collusion: leniency policy, whistleblower.<br /><br />9. Product Differentiation (* partly)<br />Hotelling Model where firms can: 1) select location freely, 2) select price freely, 3) select both price and location freely.<br /><br />10. Uninformed Consumer<br />Why there are price dispersion? To study a market with incomplete information and show that in long run, some firms set a price higher than other firms at equilibrium.<br /><br />11. Experienced Good<br />The value of a brand name.<br /><br />12. Price Discrimination (* partly)<br />Study more on 3rd and 2nd degree of price discrimination. 2nd degree: how to design an optimal menu for consumers in order to let them self select the product they value the most. The most difficult part in this course I think.<br /><br />13. Vertical Markets<br />Model of a manufacturer and a supplier. Double Marginalization; Franchise fee.<br /><br />Although many of the contents are covered by Econ3133, Prof. Au will give deeper explanation and study harder topics in general. So I think it is still good to have the lessons.<br /><br />For the Math of this course, you have to know how to solve FOC (computing partial derivatives). You don't need to know Lagrange Multiplier as Prof. Au use another way to tackle constrained maximization.<br /><br />You will do all these things repeatedly in this course:<br />1. Write a maximization problem<br />2. find the best response function by FOC<br />3. Solving simultaneous equations (I strongly suggest you program it into your calculator for the midterm exam).",
            "comment_teaching": "If you have had Prof. Au's Econ3113, you know his teaching is excellent. Even some of the contents are covered in Econ3133, I think he gives better insight.<br /><br />For the new content, every time after he solves all the complex computation and results, he will give a moral of the story which is very helpful in understanding the problem. (Especially for 2nd degree price discrimination, without those economic intuition, you will be lost in all the inequalities and constraints.)<br /><br />The the notes part, this time most of the content are in the notes. Therefore, you don't have to write many notes during class.<br /><br />The only problem is sometimes he speak too fast and being inaudible.<br /><br />TA: Clio<br />A very fun guy :D",
            "comment_grading": "Grading Scheme:<br />Participation (3%): <br />You will get this 3% if you don't misbehaved during the class.<br /><br />Problem Set (15%): <br />Best 5 out of 6, graded by effort<br /><br />Midterm Test (26%): <br />mean: 49.2/80, sd: 12.9, me: 65/80<br /><br />Final (56%): <br />mean: 107/180, sd: 35, me: 169/180 (high)<br /><br />Grade: Pending<br /><br />Tips for exam:<br />1) Get yourself a program to solve for the simultaneous equation in 2 unknowns. That saves you many time in exam.<br />2) Check whether you equilibrium answer is really the maximum. (say your answer is price = 10, you can do this by plugging in price = 9, 10, 11 in the profit function and see if it is maximized at p=10). If you get a wrong answer in computation, you lose a lot of marks in the following concept questions.<br />3) Turns out Q1 for both midterm and final this year requires some kind of clever way to solve it (or it is not as straight forward as other computational problems), skip them first.",
            "comment_workload": "No attendance of lecture and tutorial.<br />Biweekly assignment, the format is very similar to what is presented in the real exam, so do it yourself.<br /><br />Past papers and practice problems are given, they are very useful.<br /><br />Midterm is stressful, because of the limited time (only 80 minutes).<br />Final is much better because you are given 3 hours.<br /><br />I think this course teaches you how to solve problem. All the problems demonstrated in class actually follows the same framework. <br />For dynamic games, it is always to draw the game tree, then to identify each player's maximization problem, proceed by generalized backward induction.<br />For SPNE for strategies in infinite game, it is always to find the one-shot profitable deviation.<br />The interesting/difficult part of this course is how could you understand every player's payoff under different measures/action/strategies.<br /><br />So to master this course, you have to be very good at computation (to follow the framework), but also be clever to deduce player's payoff under different scenarios. (A slight change in policy can already gives completely different result!)<br /><br />Usually these 2 attributes can be trained throughout the examples given in the lecture and doing practice (basically all the resources he give)",
