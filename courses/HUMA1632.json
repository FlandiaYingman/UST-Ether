        "description": "Students will engage in a community heritage program of food technology through interdisciplinary experiential learning. They will practice the 4-stage experiential learning cycle of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation in serving as heritage docents and running traditional food processing workshops in Yimtintsai, Saikung. A holistic perspective on community and heritage highlighting the interdependence and interrelatedness of the ecological and environmental aspects, technological and economic aspects, social and political aspects, and cultural and cosmological aspects will be introduced to enhance students' understanding of interdisciplinary learning in real life contexts and stimulate their exploration and creativity. Real life experiential learning will be substantiated with laboratory sessions on food technology analysis and classroom lectures on relevant conceptual frameworks to explore critical issues about heritage preservation, tourism development and community revitalization. Critical reflections will be guided to synthesize the various experiential learning components in classroom and real life contexts.",

            "comment_content": "Focused on cultural heritage of food-related technologies in the past, mainly on preserving, modernizing, revitalizing and transforming existing food-collection method that's under threat of extinction.<br /><br />Major topics including:<br />* salt collection in Yim Tin Tsai<br />* traditional food in Yim Tin Tsai<br />* fishing method in Tai Wai village<br />* silver shrimp sauce production in Tai Wai village<br /><br />Besides slides and reading materials, there are two major day trips to each places respectively to experience the local culture and review it accordingly. There is a lab for sea salt extraction and a special and compulsory chance to setup a booth in Atrium <br /><br />Ultimately, this is a truly unique humanity course, unlike your typical common core courses with mindless exams, assignments and knowledge that you will probably forgot soon or later. It's a truly memorable experience, so memorable that I still recall some of the details when writing this review after graduation LOL",
            "comment_teaching": "Both professors are highly involved in the revitalization of both places, with excellent knowledge on cultural heritage revitalization. The teaching is unique and creative, and vastly different compared to your usual course<br /><br />I don't recall if attendance is a thing, but since the class is pretty small, the professors are always going to be aware of your absence.",
            "comment_grading": "got great result from the essay I wrote but suck at setting up an interesting booth. Got A-.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say the average is probably in region of B to B+<br /><br />Probably not the best course for consistent A-grades if you are aiming for good grades simply by studying.",
            "comment_workload": "Individual work:<br />&gt; Two essays, a few compulsory papers<br />Groupwork:<br />&gt; Lab (Class Time)<br />&gt; Setting up a booth&nbsp;&nbsp;in Atrium<br />&gt; Create Poster<br /><br />Honestly pretty demanding for the amount of work you need to do for a common core course. However, the course has neither final exam nor mid-term exam. If 100% progress based course is your thing and willing to spend some time writing the essay, it's quite manageable",
