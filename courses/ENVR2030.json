        "description": "Material and energy balance provides a quantitative account for materials and/or energy redistribution when changes happen. It is a tool which can be used to predict or solve practical problems like pollution control and management, product life-cycle analysis and management of resources (e.g. energy, food and water) for sustainable development. This course will introduce students to the fundamental principles of material and energy balance as applicable to environmental management. Covered topics include pollution control and treatment and industrial/building energy management. For EVMT students only.",

Since I am taking Thermodynamics MECH2310 as well, I can clearly feel that the content of the course is put together from a very large variety of topics in a way that makes it really difficult to understand the principles. I know that the aim of this course is to provide EVMT students with basic but useful knowledge of the whole &quot;Material and Energy&quot; field, but I don't think this is successful.",
            "comment_teaching": "Actually, the professor has quite solid knowledge on this field and you can see he is trying his best to deliver and accommodate our needs because he often asks us about what our concerns are and adjust his teaching plans.

Final 1 SD higher than mean, which is around 60(btw SD is so big, nearly 30), Assignment around mean, you have A range. However, the grading scheme keeps changing until 2 weeks before the final exam, the project, which is supposed to account for around 30%, is canceled abruptly without any prior notice. This is indeed very annoying because you will treat the assignment differently when it takes up 15 percent instead of 5 percent of your grading.",
            "comment_workload": "Only three short assignments throughout the whole semester. (There are supposed to be more, i.e. one more assignment and one whole group project, but they are canceled) To be fair, as a course that emphasizes material and energy balance, these three assignments are not enough to enhance our understanding.",

Even if you find one, you wouldn't know what is it talking about and the calculations are hard to understand.<br />Some topics covered are:<br />- Energy balance<br />- Material balance<br />- Types of energy<br />- Enthalpy<br />- Change of state<br />- Ideal gas law<br />- Heat exchanger",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is just a mess. In the start of the semester, the professor always talks about the good of Excel and hard sell it to the class, I won't trust you if you say he is not the spokesperson of Microsoft. He is trying to build up a calculating mind of his own on all of us, and always make the calculations extremely complicated even though it is an easy one. The most important thing is that he needs us to follow his calculation steps even though we are more familiar with ours. I could say if you do not have a chemistry or physics background, you will not be able to follow his words, even if you have, you will think quite hard to understand his teaching. The course itself is not difficult but the professor makes it complicated, it will be much much better if the course is taught by others",

Originally the professor sets four assignments and one group project and one final exam, but he keeps changing his plan and we didn't know that the group project is cancelled until the last few weeks of the whole semester.<br />For the assignment, the professor needs us to deal with the questions using Excel, and it is easy to copy your classmate's work. In fact, many classmates just copying from each other so you could only see a few versions of answers. for the assignment questions, you can refer to the lecture powerpoint but you will feel hopeless when you try to do it because you will not be able to find the method of dealing with some of the questions in the powerpoint. Also, in some questions, you will need to refer to some numbers or data, but the professor just gives you the link to a certain website and ask you to find it by yourselves. However, you cannot find some data on the given website, so what you can do? Yes, copying from your classmates.<br />For the final exam, there are only 5 questions and they are tricky. One unacceptable thing is that the professor didn't provide us with crucial data in calculating one of the questions and he could only realise it on hour after the start of the exam. That moment some students left already and they definitely will lose marks due to the professor's mistake.",

It is a tool which can be used to predict or solve practical problems like pollution control and management, product life-cycle analysis and management of resources (e.g. energy, food, and water) for sustainable development.
