The atmosphere of his lecture is lively. He likes to tell us jokes related to physicists (if you understand...then you understand) but no one laughs anyway...(&gt;.&lt;)<br /><br /><br />*** Our TA ---- Jeff, York Ye ***<br />Our TA is Jeff, York Ye. He is a genius...I have completely no idea how he can solve such complicated problems in his tutorial notes...Especially for those questions related to higher-order differentiability, the Jacobian matrices were definitely a nightmare for me...(╥╯﹏╰╥). He is a friendly TA, don't be afraid to ask any questions to him.<br /><br />There are some easier questions in his tutorial notes. FF probably will make use of some ideas in Jeff's tutorial and extend it to an exam problem. So pay more attention to the &quot;solvable&quot; questions in the tutorial. :D<br /><br />And finally, I don't know y but somehow Jeff can always find out some bugs in my Homework. He is a responsible TA that makes me feel like he grades our homework line by line with meticulous consideration. (✘_✘)",

It is possible to weigh HW 20%, Midterm 10% and Final 70%. Try to keep up in final.

But l hold a firm belief that the workload of MATH2043 is much lighter than LIFS1902 and ALL rubbish time-consuming common core, personally.

Derivative and differentiability<br />3. Riemann integrals and Darboux integrals<br />4. Uniform convergence<br />5. Existence Theorems of ODEs (Picard's Iteration, Picard-Lindelof's Existence Theorem, Arzela-Ascoli's Theorem and Peano's Existence Theorem)<br /><br />The last part is added by Prof. Fong, following Chapter 2 of his own ODE lecture notes.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching was excellent! Prof. Fong is very well prepared and he presented the course material in a logical and coherent way, making it easy to understand. He also proves almost all the theorems and proposition he has written down in class. In his lecture, the motivations of defining concepts and idea of proofs are very well explained.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best thing Prof. Fong did in his explanation is that he always starts with a sketch or a graph, which gives us great geometric intuition to the proof before actually writing down the proof using abstract concepts.<br /><br />The only disastrous thing about the course is the TA. I would say anyone who can fully understand his explanation deserves a Field's medal. I am super grateful that Prof. Fong was willing to teach the tutorial in person.",

In order words, you can skip all the homework if you can do very well in exams. On top of this, 1% bonus point is given to students who type up their homework using LaTex.<br /><br />The grading is quite good. Two-thirds of the class got A range. I am grateful for getting an A despite poor performance in midterm and satisfactory performance in the final.",

While this sounds a piece of cake, it is not the case as each problem requires deep thought before you can come up with the solution. Discussing the problems with a friend helps a lot.<br /><br />However, finishing the problem set is definitely inadequate for you to get a decent grade. So some extra practice from other books. This may take up quite a lot of your self studying time.",
