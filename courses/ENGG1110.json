        "description": "Throughout human history, engineering has driven the advance of civilization. In the past century engineering has recorded its greatest accomplishments, but for all these accomplishments the century ahead poses formidable problems sustaining civilization advancement. This course will broaden and raise student's awareness of challenges faced by coming generations such as climate change, clean water and healthcare. Students will work in small groups in a collaborative learning environment to explore in details and in multiple dimensions the key issues around selected major challenges with experts in the areas. Suggested and proposed engineering solutions based on advances in science and technology will be explored and discussed. Students will be encouraged to develop and present their own innovative engineering approaches to address these major challenges.",

By working in teams, they will explore various approaches that are or have been proposed around the world to address or attempt to tackle these problems. By completing the course, students will be able to:<br />1. Identify the key issues involved in two real-world engineering problems by obtaining information from experts and the literature. (Intended Learning Outcome, ILO, #1)<br />2. Analyze these problems from multiple dimensions and angles including feasibility, scalability, and sustainability. (ILO #2)<br />3.

Nothing taught in class is particularly relevant for the projects or are relevant but so basic that you could learn the same via Wikipedia. Note taking is unnecessary. With that said, I would still recommend going to class anyways because its an opportunity for you to discuss your project with your group mates; it's hard to find a collective meeting time for a group of 4 (and even harder when that group expands to 9). Attendance is taken at the beginning of the class but there are no participation points; TC encourages active participation although he is often ignored. I think he still takes attendance points into account when he gives out your final grade, especially if a lot of people score high. I would therefore recommend going to class and bring a fully charged laptop (so you can zone out and do something so as to not waste your time).",
            "comment_teaching": "TC and the respective TAs are very enthusiastic and nice. Honestly I didn't expect them to put in so much effort with teaching and making games. They hand out worksheets to assist brainstorming. It's kind of like primary school to be honest. The activities leading up to your project seem really unnecessary and childish but can be quite interesting. It's a nice change from the usual high-stress UST environment. <br /><br />Each group is assigned a TA. We had 3 TAs and a lot of past student helpers. They served to guide us through our brainstorming and often participated in our discussions as well. It really helped clarify what the professor wanted and expected from us.",

The progress report is a 2 slide PPT that displays your problem statement and your solution. It's followed by a 3 minute presentation and 2 minute Q&amp;A. Both of which are not marked. The draft report is 5 pages and consists of basic elements of your final report; this is also not graded. The final report must be within 20 pages. All guidelines and criteria are clearly listed in the syllabus. The final presentation applies to the last engineering challenge. It's a group presentation but it's not necessary for all group members to go up and speak; our group had 3 native speakers present.",

            "comment_content": "This is a hard course to write about, and an even harder course to consider taking, since THEY DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERY YEAR/SEM?? Just check the reviews! One year, they do flying drones, one year, they do blender, one year, they do race cars, etc etc... <br /><br />Anyways, for us, we had to make 3(+1 backup) football robots, each with a kicking mechanism and 3 omniwheels, with an Arduino that connects to your Android app using Bluetooth. From this course, you will (or should) learn Arduino, Android MIT App Inventor, some basic electronics, and 3d modelling. Sounds fun, right? Hell no. Just read the rest of this review or any other one to find out why.<br /><br />One thing is for certain, if we did not have access to the labs 24/7, we would be SCREWED. Especially with HK MAYBE shutting down soon, please please please keep in mind that this course will probably bum you hard if you do it online! Only take it if you are sure you are willing to carry your team or will do it with friends.",
            "comment_teaching": "Simple. They do not. I wish I was joking, I really do. They do not teach you anything. They give you some basic information using HKMOOC which is some sort of online learning platform where you're forced to watch overly long videos about something or the other, and then when you actually need to build your robots... You will end up using 33% asking an STA, 33% Google, 33% trial and error, and 1% giving up and trying something else.<br /><br />Have fun lol",
            "comment_grading": "Individual (30%) work:<br />HKMOOC - 5%<br />Launch Level Demo - 10%<br />Robot Design - 5%<br />Kicking Mechanism Design Sketch - 5%<br />Attendance for Build Sessions - 5%<br /><br />Team (70%) work:<br />First Build Demo - 15%<br />Final Competition Part 1 (Dribble/Shoot) - 20%<br />Final Competition Part 2 (Football Match) - 25%<br />Team Logo/Uniform - 10%<br /><br />Upon first glance, the grading may seem quite fair for a project course. HOWEVER, the biggest problem is that any idiot with more than 2 braincells will be able to 100% the individual section. Furthermore, any team with more than 4 collective braincells will be able to 100% everything EXCEPT the final competition. The STAs (who grade you) are trying to be nice and generous, but that leads to everything - almost your entire grade - coming down to one lesson, and in our case, a final football match and competition we only did well in thanks to luck. For context, our robots were basically trashcans with wheels, with cardboard torn up and taped onto them, and only won because we cheesed our 'kicking mechanism' to be sticks coming out of the robot (they didn't even move).<br /><br />(Also, not to mention, initially, part 1 of the final competition had all 3 of your robots placed on a table styled like a football pitch and they had to pass and dribble through a specified path to score a goal. Initially, there were lots of sharp turns and corners but since it was too hard, they made it a straight line LMAO so everyone aced it.) <br /><br />Essentially, your final grade was determined by how you did in the final football match, which was... essentially luck. Your teammates control the robots, but that doesn't mean anything. Our team literally just got lucky - maybe the other team robots didn't work, or the ball hit at the wrong angle, etc etc...<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty sure I got 100% in everything, but coming 2nd place in the final competition gave our team an A. I am very happy, but I do not imagine the same can be said for everyone.",
            "comment_workload": "The work you do, and the effort you put in, does not mean you will get a good grade. Unfortunately, that will most likely always be the case in such a competitive course, especially true for us since we had a football match. Teams that had super cool kicking mechanisms, using clever ways to implement things like actuators, motors and whatnot, 3d printing parts to join it all together, only to come last?? <br /><br />I, and some others, spent several nights, especially leading up to the build demo and final competition working in the lab until up to 4am. The lab is usually open at this time, which saved many teams. <br /><br />Also, despite having a team of 5, I am giving you a 100% guarantee that we could have done just as well, if not better, with just 3. Some team members did absolutely nothing, partially because there WAS nothing to do... We split the robot building into coding, 3d design and electronics, and they didn't really do anything so... ??? I hope you're a hard worker and don't piggyback your team if you do take this course.",
