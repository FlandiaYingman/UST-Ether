        "name": "Integrating Components to Kinematic Industrial Design System",
        "description": "This special topic course is about how to prototype through Industrial Design a simple kinematic system. Each participants’ fundamental concept and skill on how to build a functional prototype will be supported at ISD Works! The course includes lectures on successful examples and case studies to be transferred by the students to practical hands-on building models for materializing their concepts, including kinematic chains, joints and drives, plus eventually sensors and actuator-sensor-interfaces. The integration of different components through Industrial Design is the important key topic for this course. The students will acquire applied knowledge through case studies, practical hands-on model making of their respective projects’ ideas and concepts. Instructor’s approval is required.",
