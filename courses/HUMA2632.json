        "description": "This course is a survey of traditional and contemporary Chinese cultural practices in local communities based on anthropologists’ long-term first-hand fieldwork studies in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China. Basic anthropological concepts and theories about Chinese socio-cultural institutions will be examined. Major anthropological contributions to the understanding of the diversity and unity of Chinese cultures and societies will be explored.",

Course introduction<br />2. The Scope of Anthropology<br />3. The anthropological Study of Culture<br />------------------------------------------<br />The following topics are specific studies of Chinese culture:<br />4. Family<br />5. Lineage<br />6. Gender and Marriage<br />7. Rural Life<br />8. Regional and Marketing System<br />9. Religion<br />10. State and Society<br />11. Guanxi as Social Relations<br />12. Cities, Urbanization, and the Flowing Population<br />13. Consumption and Economic Behavior<br />14. Ethnicity<br /><br />A book named &quot;The Spiral Road: Change in a Chinese Village Through the Eyes of a Communist Party Leader&quot; is also used as the course's tutorial material, which will be tested throughout the course's tutorials.",
            "comment_teaching": "As the class schedule already mentioned/warned, HUMA2632 is taught in Cantonese, although course materials are written in English. The lecture itself is 2 hours, a period comparable with winter/summer sem courses, and the 1-hour tutorial is on the same day of the lecture.<br /><br />Professor Cheung sometimes can be inaccurate when teaching the course materials, such as using long examples or personal experience before cutting into the point he wants to explain, but once you can grasp his idea, it should be OK. Another point to notice is that he never uses his email to answer post-lesson questions, which are always done by appointment in-person or virtual meetings.<br /><br />Regarding the tutorials, the tutorials are essentially quiz bowls about the tutorial book, organized by the responsible tutorial team. You score points for answering the questions (i.e. participation), although the professor may handpick some people who have relatively low points.",
            "comment_grading": "For a total of 350 points:<br />Attendance: 50 (50) (14.3%)<br />Tutorial Presentation and participation: 50+50 (43+50) (28.5%)<br />1 Virtual Field trip (with worksheet): 50 (49) (14.3%)<br />Research Project (proposal &amp; report): 20+130 (18+121) (42.9%)<br /><br />While it is reported that the course previously have exams, this time we don't have any exam-like assessments. The 3 virtual field trips are conducted through Zoom, and you only need to participate in one and submit one worksheet.<br /><br />Assessment grades are given through email at the end of the semester. It seems that the grading is quite good, you get grades proportional to your effort towards the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end I get an A+, the first since my university life.",
            "comment_workload": "At the beginning the workload is quite light, as you only need to prepare for the tutorials, choose a virtual field trip to participate and complete the corresponding worksheet. However, in late March, you'll be forming project groups of two and work on the anthropology research project. The professor don't involve in grouping, and you'll left alone with workload raised to another exponential/factorial if you can't find a groupmate.<br /><br />Since then you'll be busying in collecting first-hand evidence and participating in various project-related activities. You're also expected to have multiple meetings with the professor if your research topic isn't good enough. I'm quite lucky to be paired with another helpful groupmate, and together we did make up our report from scratch.",
