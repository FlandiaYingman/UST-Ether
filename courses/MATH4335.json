Linear algebra (Essential - Tedious matrix computation is required for &quot;running the algorithm&quot; by hand)<br />3. Experiences on AI and machine learning (Nonessential - No coding is required, but the algorithms are applicable as AI algorithms)<br />4. Functional analysis (Nonessential - Familiarity on Hilbert space theory may be good for content related to proximal operator)<br /><br />The course is divided as follows:<br /><br />1. Preliminary (mathematical review)<br /><br />-&gt; Multivariable calculus<br />-&gt; Some key topological properties (convexity plays a key role in optimization theory)<br /><br />Comment: This part should not exist at all... Nothing to say. <br /><br />2. Methods for differentiable functions<br /><br />-&gt; Gradient descent<br />-&gt; Newton's method<br />-&gt; Conjugate algorithm <br />-&gt; Nesterov acceleration <br /><br />Comment: For each of these algorithms, convergence analysis and choice of hyperparameters are discussed. <br /><br />3. Methods for nondifferentiable convex functions<br /><br />-&gt; Subdifferenital (Extension of derivative in convex sense)<br />-&gt; Proximal operator<br />-&gt; FBS algorithm <br /><br />4. Method of duality<br /><br />-&gt; Definition of dual problem <br />-&gt; Weak and strong duality, slater condition and slater theorem<br />-&gt; KKT condition and strong duality for convex problem <br />-&gt; Linear programming (Duality method, simplex, path-following...)<br />-&gt; First order optimization (projected gradient descent and Uzawa algorithm)",

Some problems in quizzes reappear in the exam. I'm quite surprised that there are multiple choice questions in the exam and quizzes given that it is a 4000-level course...",
