        "description": "This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of Western music theory with an emphasis on reading and writing musical notation, ear training, and analytical listening. Students will develop an understanding of how texture, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, melodic development, and other parameters interact to create music. Examples used in the class will be drawn mostly, but not exclusively, from classical repertoire. Although prior musical training will be helpful, there are no prerequisites for the course.",

What the prof&amp;ta teach in the class is FAR NOT ENOUGH.<br /><br />Let me explain what is music sense with examples :<br />(i) In one of my assignments, I forget to add a few natural signs (♮) in the same bar when I am doing a chromatic notes exercise. <br /><br />(ii) I got 70+ marks in the last two assignments.......just because I do not write down the two horizontal lines for the roman numeral 5. <br /><br /><br />For people who are familiar with music systems, those are just common sense and this kind of mistake should not appear. It is what this course looks for and they will not remind you about this, they expect you to know about this after they introduce the topic.<br /><br />Tips: better to check your answers via google (Eg. find something like chord calculator, interval calculator, etc) before submission, it is too easy to make mistakes when doing the assignment.",

            "comment_content": "There's another recent review which has already covered this part well so I won't write much here. Just that there's a lot of musical theory content squeezed into one course. Despite what the course content says 'No musical background needed', it is highly recommended you know concepts before taking this class. Take this class if you REALLY, I mean really FUCKING want to learn some interesting music stuff like composition and analyzing melodies. This will be different from other HUMA classes which are more about memorizing lecture slides.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is fantastic. Ilari is indeed passionate and explains clearly. He is a nice Finnish professor who is fluent in English. Even Galison the TA is quite good in his teaching and makes tutorials fun. The biggest downside of this class is there is strict attendance taken sharp at 9 am. If you even come 15 minutes late, you will lose out. But then the class itself is only 50 minutes.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading can be pretty strict. Stuff like how major and minor chords are notated etc. Plus you really need to work with musical staff which is really hard&nbsp;&nbsp;especially when there's little space to fill out notes. <br /><br />Midterm was lengthy and had to be finished in 50 minutes. Final however time was adequate. And understand that there will be students who will have extensive musical background so be highly aware of the competition in class. <br /><br />Pro Tip- The most challenging part of this class is the ear training. So from day 1, USE THIS WEBSITE TO TRAIN YOUR EARS. https://www.teoria.com/en/exercises/<br />Better to use this for about 5-10 mins a day rather cram towards the end.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is awfully high. There's a homework assigned every class and that could take an hour or so to finish. I guess this is the case since music theory is not something that can be memorized a few nights before the exam. Rather the concepts build up over one another. Initially it may be manageable, but not when you get busier in the semester and when the concepts start to get harder.",

During his lecture, no electronic devices were allowed. <br /><br />The tutorials were conducted by his TA, mainly focus on aural training (melodic dictation, rhythm dictation, distinguish the triads, chords and cadences) and pointed us the common mistakes in the homework. The training will help you to familiarize the format of the exam.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework 25%<br /><br />The homework percentage is same as the final exam percentage, so it is very important to score full marks in every homework, this consequently will give you a big advantage towards your final grade. It is suggested that you can check the answers with your friends in the same course in order to make sure you didn't make careless mistakes. REMEMBER, DO NOT SUMMIT THE HOMEWORK LATE!!!! You will get 50% or 100% marks deduction on that piece of homework. I scored around 98% in total of all 16 homework assignments.<br /> <br />Final Exam 25%<br /><br />There is no release of our own score or statistics. My competitors were very strong, many of them left the exam venue very early....I finished the exam 50 mins before time is up, but it is recommended to stay until the end and check your paper again and again.....正所謂小心駛得萬年船<br /><br />Concert report 15%<br /><br />There was also no release of the mark of concert report. You need to attend one professional classical music concerts and write analysis on a piece or a movement in a symphony. It is suggested that the concert report can focus on the meter, tonality, dynamics changes, tempo changes, any cadences observed and modulations. It is great to describe the mood and your own feeling of the piece. I also give some basic background (history) of the piece. Moreover, I included my comments on the concertmaster and the soloists of that concert. Professor also focus on your language in the concert report.<br /><br />Midterm 20%<br /><br />The Mean is 96.78/120, SD:20.59<br />I scored around +0.6sd <br /><br />Attendance/participation 15%<br /><br />The TA Galison LAU used a crazy way to take the attendance. First, he used IPRS to check attendance, then used raffle system (by calling you to answer professor's questions) to make sure you are in the room, not your friends helping you to take attendance. I skipped one lecture because I woke up late..not sure how will it affect the attendance mark.<br /><br />Final Grade: A",
            "comment_workload": "For me, the homework workload is quite harsh.There are 16 assignments throughout the semester. You should expect that you may spend at least an hour in a piece of homework if you do it carefully. Moreover, some homework may have many questions and very tedious. For example, there are at least 50 questions in one page of triads, sevenths and intervals homework. The main problem is, a piece of homework is assigned on Monday's lecture and you must submit on Wednesday's lecture......<br /><br />It is very lucky that professor allow us to submit the concert report and the final composition project on the day of final examination. However, you may need to spend some time on working them. <br /><br />Before final examination, it is advised to use an online ear training website called teoria, the website can help you to practice on distinguishing between different triads and sevenths chords.",

Apart from knowledge taught in class, students must attend at least two concerts/ workshops in Sep and Oct. At last, students have to compose a piece by themselves. <br /><br />In the tutorials, the TA Mr. Galison will revise what the professor taught in the last few lessons, and provide interactive practices, like singing, hearing chords, and ear training about music types.<br /><br />The course teaches about the things I learned while learning piano, so it was easy for me to handle. But I think it will be challenging for beginners with zero musical background to follow the lectures because it requires an understanding of music theory. For reference, I'm a pianist with ABRSM grade 8 and practicing piano for over 12 years. <br /><br />Topic 1: Rhythm notation<br />Topic 2: Pitch notation<br />Topic 3: Keys and&nbsp;&nbsp;scales<br />Topic 4: Intervals<br />Topic 5: Major key melodies<br />Topic 6: Triads and seventh chords<br />Topic 7: Minor key melody<br />Topic 8: Harmonic analysis<br />Topic 9: Rhythmic composition",

Basically if you already passed ABRSM grade 5 music theory, and have some ear training (so you have some sense of relative pitch and rhythm), I believe you can take this course, even if your music theory is kinda rusty. However, the workload is really high, as you can see from the grading and other reviews probably. I have attached the first 3 homework I got, it gets much more complex later. If you're rusty in music theory like I was, you'll have to spend a bit of time studying the material, especially when it gets to the triads and cadences part. Keep in mind you have to juggle this with your other courses too. long story short is if you think you can just chill and get an easy grade, don't take this course, well unless you're some sort of musical genius I guess.",

It would be easy for students that have played an instrument before or has other music backgrounds.

However, the dictation part is extremely difficult for students that have never played any musical instruments. Even practicing would not be useful for the dictation if you do not have any music talent.<br />Students are required to attend 4 concerts (included in attendance) and write a report (an essay describing your experience) of around 600 words based on one of the concerts.<br />The final project is a composition that is required to hand in at the end of the semester. Previous assignments would help you finish the task piece by piece.<br />Attendance is randomly taken in classes, so I would suggest you to attend all of them to avoid losing marks. <br />To conclude, as long as you finish all the homework, concert report and final project on time, attend all classes and tutorial sessions, and understand the course content, I believe getting a B would not be too difficult.

If you've done AP music theory like me, this should be amazing revision as well as great for solidifying your foundation knowledge! <br /><br />Weeks 1 ~ 3: The really basic stuff. Notation, rhythm, keys and scales etc. i.e. things you've probably learnt from primary / secondary school music classes.<br /><br />Weeks 4 ~ 7: Melodies. Musical textures, composition structures, intervals.<br />Weeks 8 ~ 10: Chords. Triads and seventh chords in major and minor keys, inversions. This is where it starts to pick up the pace.<br />Weeks 11 ~ 13: Harmony. Chord progressions, cadences, harmonising a melody.",
            "comment_teaching": "By far the best thing about the course. Professor Kaila is not only an amazing composer (you should definitely stalk his Shostakovitch in Context on Spotify), he's also a genuinely funny and easy going person. <br /><br />He dives into more abstract topics of rhythm and pitch and notation in a way that's still interesting for someone who has previous background. He explains topics very clearly while playing the piano so you develop a better ear as well which really helps.<br /><br />He genuinely spends hours and hours writing feedback for EACH person's composition. No, it's not just a single line, I got almost 4 detailed paragraphs which is basically an essay so it goes to show how much he cares for the student's improvement.<br /><br />I might be a bit biased since he saw my interest in music composition and spent almost an hour after the lecture helping me with what I had and just giving me guidance and advice in general, but I guess that's good enough of a reason to say that he's a great professor.<br /><br />Galison is the tutorial instructor who's there for every lecture as well as your extra tutorials. He's also amazing and lets you have a good laugh in his classes which really helps lighten up the mood, alongside helping you with any problems you might have, even in his spare time.",
            "comment_grading": "Absolute grading here so don't worry about the crazy mean and s.d.<br /><br />-Mid-term (20%): I got a 110/120, mean 92/120 with s.d of around 27<br />-Finals (25%): I got a 194/218, mean 168 with s.d 37 <br />-Final Composition (10%)<br />-Concert Report (15%)<br />-Homework (25%)<br />-Attendance (25%)<br /><br />This is when things start going downhill. Half the class has a really solid classical background while the other half absolutely close to none, which is why you end up with a standard deviation of 30 in a 120 mark exam :) I absolutely do NOT recommend taking the course without being able to read notes fluently (and I mean FLUENTLY), unless you love music, then totally go ahead because you'll need lots of dedication. I only say this because of how much my friends with no musical background struggled, but they also loved the course despite their not being so great grades so go for it if you'd like! <br /><br />Not all hope is lost though, since the grading is very split up. If you attend all lectures, do all the homework with care, write a decent concert report, as well as pay attention to professor Kaila's feedback on your composition, it should be good enough to get a decent B range!<br /><br />LIFE TIP: If you're horrible at melodic dictation just like me, SKIP IT, and instead totally focus on writing down the rhythm of the piece only rather than the pitch! (This gets you 15/30 marks in that segment, and since the exam is 220 marks, losing 15 marks is absolutely nothing, you can easily score full marks on the other parts)<br /><br />Remember to differentiate different 7th chords as well!",

This is meant for you to familiarise how the things you learn in the lectures are applied in a musical setting and helps a lot with the composition exercise and exam.<br /><br />Listening to Dr. Kaila chat with students with musical background is also great for clearing up anything you don't understand.",

A small portion of content needs to be memorised (e.g. circle of fifths, interval names, chords). Also DO EAR TRAINING!!!<br /><br />IPRS is used to take attendance at the start of lectures. Dr. Kaila will also occasionally pick students to answer questions during lectures. Tutorial sessions also require attendance.<br /><br />Is a 09:30 a.m. course though so decide this for yourself.",
            "comment_workload": "Somewhat heavy workload, but most of the time manageable.<br /><br />Homework is usually in the form of print-out worksheets of the textbook. Pretty straightforward most of the time (e.g. identify / construct the interval / chord) but tends to get slightly repetitive because they're practically the same task.<br /><br />Part of the homework is a composition exercise. It is procedural, i.e. you build it up as you learn. Dr. Kaila will provide most of the guidelines, the rest can be found in the textbook. Doesn't need to be a Bach-level masterpiece, just needs to show that you can utilise the knowledge you've learnt.<br /><br />Concert report requires you to, obviously, attend a concert and write a short report (short in comparison to some essays in other CC courses). &quot;Concerts&quot; are not the pop music ones, but the more &quot;classical&quot; ones. Dr. Kaila will recommend you go to one hosted by HKUST with free admission.<br /><br />Also need to do ear training off-course. Dr. Kaila will provide resource for practice. Being able to identify chords by listening is crucial to this course.",

Students with music background should feel very easy but non-music background students should feel depressed. A progress learning of how to compose a short melody will be taught.",

These 2 assignment took me a longer time to complete, about 45-60 minutes.<br /><br />Midterm and Final are easy because 85% of the questions are similar to assignments, and with about 15% listening tasks. So if you can complete the assignments by yourself, there will be no problem to get high mark in midterm and final.<br /><br />The final project is composing a ABA structured 24 bar melody with harmonization. This takes me about 5-6 hours to finish which is not a lot considering this is 10% of the total grade. The abovementioned assignments will guide you the process, also professor spent 2-3 lessons talking about composition so that should be easy.<br /><br />The listening assignment is a replacement for the cancelled concert report. A piece is randomly chosen, you have to listen it and then write a 500 word report, which is not very difficult.",

I'm a DSE music student so this review may not be the best indicator to gauge whether the course is suitable for you if you're a newbie to music theory.*<br /><br />The content basically covers ALL ABRSM music theory content, from grade 1 to 6. Others have already copy and pasted the syllabus on their reviews so perhaps I won't do it here.<br /><br />The content itself is quite straight-forward for students to learn: ranging from basic rhythm patterns, key signatures, scales to intervals, melodic patterns and texture. But then after mid-term, it goes south. It contains a bunch of triads and 7th chords, which is crazy for an introductory class for music theory. That's why you shouldn't reg this course if you haven't studied 5/8th grade theory.<br /><br />PS. If you want to consolidate the contents learned in class, be sure to purchase ABRSM's music theory practices to do. I'm sure those helps a lot. Online resources are also helpful.",
            "comment_teaching": "I fucking LOVE Ilari. <br /><br />Ilari is a music enthusiast and humorous guy. He's very experienced in music and you can simply search him on google as to listen to his composition. He also gives us so much flexibility for projects, e.g. allowing you to switch music piece for listening assignment if you don't like it; He allows you to ask him about homework and will guide you on the right path (he gives very detailed feedback and never 'hea' me when I have concerns). I really hope that professors in UST can be like him. Bonus mark: he is a hong kong lover (if you know, you know. wink wink)<br /><br />Regarding Rod, the tutor, the content has much to be desired. He is quite a nice guy to talk with, but the content in tutorials are quite subpar and monotonous, e.g. rhythmic dictation. Also, he always makes mistakes and is quite inefficient. More importantly, he is very rigid in marking assignments, e.g. you have to write PERFECT authentic cadence to earn a mark, A note does not equal Bbb because it is different... what he does is kind of like 雞蛋裏挑骨頭<br /><br />As my title implies, if you have learnt theory before, you'll have a great time attending class and answering professor's questions (Attendance is needed. He picks students to answer questions, so never 掛機). But if you're a beginner, then you're going to suffer miserably -- Learning triads, melodic and rhythmic phrases after merely three month of introductions... Simply put, it would be overwhelming, if not extremely difficult, for people who are new learners. What is most important is that Ilari is not exam-oriented, meaning, he won't teach you the skills of theory. That's why I strongly recommend you to buy Eric Taylor's ABRSM theory exercises, or go online to search for materials for self-learning.",

            "comment_workload": "No e-book is needed (there are digital handouts, those aren't really helpful though), and there is at least one assignment each week. The workload for each of the assignments depends: For those with intervals and scales, there are definite answers. But for assignments about composition, e.g. 8-bar melodic phrases, it will cost more time, perhaps 1-2 hours to finish. I suggest you contact prof to have some feedback before handing in your final work, as to ensure that you can have a clear idea of what your marks will be for the assignment. I think this is great because many professors simply don't give a f to their students and hea reply emails, whereas Ilari is willing to discuss with you in a detailed manner,.<br /><br />Although there are homework assignments every week, it isn't necessarily a bad thing -- As homework accounts for 15% of grading, even if you lose some marks in particular assignments, it won't affect much on the overall grade due to small proportions. It is also a great way to consolidate concepts, so it's fine to me. <br /><br />I think the workload is moderate because I have learnt all of the topics before from ABRSM syllabus. But if you are a beginner, you should surely think twice before choosing this course.<br /><br />If you got any questions or want me to help you out, feel free to comment below :)",

Homework and exam are quite easy so losing 1 or 2 marks can really downgrade your course grade.

The course culminates in a final project of composing a simple tonal piece.",

Bach and Mozart) as examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Attendance and participation are included in the course's grade. So make sure to actively participate in class, answer questions from the professor, and turn on your webcam (If the class is online), in order to get all the points in terms of attendance and participation.<br /><br />The TA, Rod, is a nice guy.

The professor loves students to answer his questions, and I really enjoy answering his questions, since those questions he has already mentioned in HUMA3104 before:)<br /><br />When the professor tries to ask whether everyone can follow his teaching, I am always be the one telling him continue teaching ;) 正所謂唔好拖慢個教學進度呀屌 考多d八級樂理內容，我先可以屌打你地，final出咁淺dllm",
            "comment_teaching": "Both prof Kaila and Rod are good teachers, who put passion in teaching. Prof Kaila is a well-known composer who always interacts with students during the lectures, ensuring everyone can follow his teaching pace. Rod mainly does ear training with us during the tutorial sections. During tutorial sections, is fun to see him messing up sometimes, especially the rhythm or melody dictation lolllll<br /><br />Both of them are very happy to answer your questions, best teachers I've met so far in UST.",
