This 10% participation eventually contributes like 70+% of the grade, at least true in my case.<br /><br />Given my hard work and grade not reflecting my efforts and performance, I appealed at least 4 times base on the &quot;appeal process&quot;, from lecturer, to program coordinator, to SBM, to the dean office.

Going through all the course materials is a must and you must think the relations between slides deeply to digest everything. Once you understand the concept, this course is not that tough.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is very knowledgeable in this area. Theoretically, he derives equations from the basics to show us the facts on the financial ground. On the practical front, he used a couple of real-life cases to show whether an IPO / merger is a success, why a company needs to engage in such corporate event but not others, how to work on valuation multiples, etc.<br /><br />His teaching maybe a little bit fast, especially on the theory part, where he expects you to have solid and fresh memory of FINA2303 and FINA3103 knowledge. While he starts from the basics, he will go through your &quot;past&quot; courses only in the first 2-3 weeks, with minor additions of the new materials. I would advise not skipping the first few classes because the learning curve will be steeper than you have expected.<br /><br />He got an accent, somewhere from the Europe I guess, but it's fine. Tha TA Kennedy looks kam, but he is indeed very nice and will answer questions related to exam materials and logistics in detail and promptly. <br /><br />Some said the professor teaches too fast, which I agree but do not think it is a problem. Students taking this course are at least Year3/4 Fina major, who should have the competency to digest the course materials in the delivered pace. It takes me about three hours at weekend to review and preview, but in general I do not think the pace is a problem and I appreciate how the professor could compress the entire Investment Banking Division into one single semester.",

Make sure to answer or ask questions in the lesson (or after class) starting from the first few classes so the professor can recognise your name. Particpation matters quite much.<br /><br />2. Do all the past paper released by the Professor. The format of Midterm and Final are pretty much the same as the samples. Midterm is like FINA2303 level but the final is quite tough. Questions in final are like brain-teasers. However, most of the question formats are very similar to the samples, so going over them are essential to get good grades in the Final Exam.<br /><br />Grade:<br />Midterm: 92.5/100 (Mean around 80)<br />Final: Not disclosed, I think I did well<br />Project: Not disclosed, I think I did ok<br />Attendance: I answered question almost every class<br /><br />Final Grade: A+<br /><br />The grading scheme is reasonable for a physical semester since there are midterm and final exams, which works fine differentiating students. Participation is still important. <br /><br />One downside is that the grades were not transparent. However, I guess if someone feels unsatisfied it is possible to send an email to ask. Apart from that, I think the overall grading was quite lenient.",
            "comment_workload": "A bit of the workload towards the end of the semester due to the project. You will form a 4-ppl group and basically select a division in the IBD then pretend as an analyst by choosing a client to work on a transaction. Usually, students pick IPO (our group too, coz easiest and more stuff to say) of a company and see if overvalued/undervalued. You will have to use Refinitiv (or other means e.g. if you have a Bloomberg account in your intern office) to extract financial reports, then make proper assumptions, then different methods to valuate the company and give analyses at the end.<br /><br />This project itself is tedious but also interesting if you like working as a banker. You will then write up a report and present it in 7-8 mins which shouldn't be difficult.<br /><br />Other workloads include reading cases once per two/three weeks and midterm and final.

NO marks are given except for the midterm. The mean is very high.<br />Please look at the syllabus for the requirement of each item.<br /><br />Individual project(40%): only 10 pages report, I think one day or two days can finish it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a requirement for us to do the presentation(&lt;3 mins, a few pages of ppt) and Q&amp;A<br /><br />Individual Project peer review(10%): review one of the classmate's project and give one-page comment. It only takes 1 hour to do it.<br /><br />Midterm(20%): Relative valuation and DCF again. For me, it is quite difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(mean: 17.7, high 20, me: 17.6)<br /><br />No in class quiz due to online semester. Case write up appears instead.<br />2 Case write up (10%*2): two cases. Answer 5-7 questions for each case. My write-up is quite short (maybe the reason why I get a bad grade?) and you can expect to finish one write-up in 2-3 hours.<br /><br />Class participation(10%): I skipped half of the classes. But if I attend, I will do the participation, but I 9up only.<br />There is also slack for participation, just copy from the internet and write a few words about the news.<br /><br />Final letter grade: B+ (probably a good grade already for a FINA course with midterm below mean, and I don't really understand the course content)<br /><br />I just send an email to prof for breakdown:<br />i got report 35/40, and all other items in excellent (10/10)<br />(my friend Midterm 17.3 + report 29 --&gt; B-)<br /><br />I am quite sure the prof and the TA do not really mark the case write up seriously and simply give all people full mark.<br />Only midterm and project determine your grade",
