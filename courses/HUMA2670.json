            "comment_content": "Basically every important type of painting, with examples, that appeared in the West from ancient Greek vase painting to Andy Warhol.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely comprehensive and informative if you really are into western painting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives you a detailed overview of western art with some background history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna also explained painting styles and techniques with a considerable amount of jargons (no, the majority of them are not English words).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I personally find the course not that challenging, but you'll need a good memory to score better than others in her quizzes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust me, you'll always find someone who remembers everything and gets full scores, and some who choose not to remember a single word then get shitty scores.<br /><br />The good news is, exams (or quizzes, the way she called them) are NOT accumulative.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, 3000 years of western painting is divided (not equally) into 4 quizzes.",
            "comment_teaching": "Anna is a great lecturer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multilingual and extremely knowledgeable.&nbsp;&nbsp;She explains things clearly and analyzes paintings not only from the aesthetics, but also from socio-economic conditions, history, religions and politics. <br /><br />But the main problem, as JC mentioned in HUMA2680's review, is her unidirectional way of teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll need to take tons of notes and be very focused to get the most out of her lectures (and yes, she'll include all those small things you thought you won't be tested on in her quizzes).",
            "comment_grading": "Fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Final grading is based on all four quizzes (30% each for midterm and final quiz, 20% each for the rest two).&nbsp;&nbsp;The quizzes include MCs,fill in the blanks and short essays (midterm and final quiz only).&nbsp;&nbsp;There are around 20-25 questions per quiz, takes less than 45 minutes to finish a quiz.<br /><br />My final score was around 1 to 1.2 s.d. above mean, got an A-",
            "comment_workload": "A few pages of readings per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To be honest I don't think they are included in the quizzes, but the readings will greatly help you understand the background of selected paintings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really worth the read.<br /><br />The main source of workload comes from memorization of terms, paintings and painters.",
