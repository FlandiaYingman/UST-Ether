        "description": "As the two most notorious ambient pollutants, O3 and PM2.5, exert adverse health impacts on human beings. It is still unclear how these two pollutants change under the climate change scenario. In this study, the student needs first to apply the KZ filter to de-trend the air quality time series. The purpose of processing this step is to remove the noise from the time series. The second step is to build up the relationship between the air quality time series and the meteorological time series. We expect to quantify the climate impacts on the air quality via this project. The student should seek the course instructor's approval to take this course.",
