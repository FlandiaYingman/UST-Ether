        "description": "The aim of this course is to provide an in-depth treatment of the theoretical basis, analysis, and design of digital communication systems. The first half of the course will focus on the theoretical foundations of a basic digital communication system, including source coding, modulating and channel coding, and introductory information theory. The second half will deal with advanced techniques including orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multi-antenna communications, spread-spectrum communications, and cooperative communications.",
