        "description": "The special topic course introduces the fundamental principles and techniques on how to design embedded systems for Integrative Systems. The course includes fundamental theory and also practical hands-on labs and projects for the student to acquire the basic knowledge on how the hardware of an embedded systems work and how to develop embedded software on embedded processors. Software development platform and tools will be introduced. It also includes topics like interfacing, memory architecture, low power design techniques, software-hardware co-design which are required for optimizing the performance of embedded system for complex integrative systems such as assistive robots. The students will acquire the knowledge through lectures, case studies, and practical hands-on labs and projects. Instructorâ€™s approval is required.",
