Fewer and fewer people attended the class along the semester.<br /><br />I still do not understand why blended-learning approach is suitable for an accounting course.

The videos are ridiculously long and she talks a lot of irrelevant stuff, so after a while I just gave up on watching the videos and read the slides by myself, I found this to be more effective.<br /><br />Honestly, it's surprising that an accounting course is adopting the blended learning policy, but it is what it is. Just self-study and do the questions in the textbook before the final as it's very similar to the actual questions in the final.",

I never asked any questions. Since it was Zoom this semester, I think attendance was counted through Zoom. Just log into Zoom and do whatever you want, that's what I did.<br />Homework: 50%<br />Best 10 out of 12 counted, everyone should get full marks since answers can easily be found online<br />Final Exam: 40%<br />Pretty straightforward exam, she said questions will be similar to those in the textbook and she was right. Nothing too challenging and practicing with the questions in the textbook should help secure a decent grade.<br /><br />Although I got A eventually, I would say the grading is pretty trash because it solely depends on your final and there is no transparency with the grading.",

For the other class, she will upload the contents and videos on canvas which will be taught that week. She expects every student to watch them before attending the F2F class. For me, I did not watch any of them lmfao because they are ridiculously long. It may take you 3 hours to finish the whole lecture video. Therefore, I read the textbook instead because the things she taught is actually from the textbook. If you want to learn something or at least know what she is talking about during the F2F class, then you really need to spend time to read the textbook or watch the videos before class. Otherwise, you will be just sitting for the whole class doing nothing.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework: 50%<br />Final Exam: 40%<br />Participation: 10%<br /><br />There are 12 online homeworks in total (1 per week) and only the best 10 will be counted. I think students usually get full marks here because there are two attempts for each question. If you do it wrong for the first attempt, then find a friend to ask for their answers. However, the numbers for some questions maybe different as they are auto-generated. Just ask them for the formula is fine.<br /><br />The final exam covers all the materials taught throughout the semester, and most of the questions are in the form of preparation of journal entries. I think it is the best to study hard for the final exam as it is the key factor that mainly affects your grade.<br /><br />Not too sure how the participation score is counted. Sometimes, she will give out a piece of blank paper before the F2F class starts and requires students to write their questions on the paper. But seems that attendance will not be taken cuz my friend still got A- even though he skipped all the classes lol.<br /><br />Lmao I somehow managed to get B+ given the fact that I did not watch any of her lecture videos and by just reading the textbook.",

The first few classes was about the IFRS framework (which was a bit boring), and then we start talking about the asset side of the B/S (which is the focus of the whole course). Content was not difficult to digest, but we needed to memorize a lot of journal entries, so practice practice practice to understand what situation to do which entry.<br />There's also a project that focuses on revenue recognition to deepen our understanding of the topic, coz there was a new guideline (IFRS 15) that was just published.",
            "comment_teaching": "Amy was a very good professor, but a lot of the time she reads the PPT, and uses examples from the textbook directly. She has a deep understanding of the market, and will sometimes share her thoughts on some market news during class. But since the examples were really limited, we have to do a lot of practice to understand more. Also, this semester was the first time Amy asked students to do a project for this course, so she didn't really give clear instructions on how to complete the project. In the end, after the presentation, she commented that we should focus a bit more on the quantitative side of things (meaning we should focus on how to do journal entries instead of just explaining the new revenue recognition rules) and the market's reaction to the new rule. So next year be aware of that.",

This year's final exam questions were all from the textbook exercises. Exams are all non-cumulative. <br />After the midterm, start doing the project, instead of leaving it for the final few weeks, or you won't have much time.",
