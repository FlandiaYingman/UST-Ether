The previous comment have listed out all of the content. Therefore I would not repeat.<br />It is quite boring listening to those classic fiction for us, especially for student who are not interested in literature.",
            "comment_teaching": "The content is boring but professor is okay. <br />He realize that some of you are reluctant to listen to same content and same voice day by day. Therefore, sometimes he would play some video in class to help you to know the story of the novels.<br />Professor does not really mind that you are late or absent, but you better not to do that so frequently and you would miss particular information.<br />The professor is from China, but you don't need to say something to show that you love the major party in China so much.",

            "comment_workload": "Workload is quite much if you really read those novels he gave, since every fictions is quite thick and you would spend so much time on it. Besides reading, no extra assignment are required. There are just 2 test, one is midterm and one is final exam.<br />In conclude, if you want to get good result in this course, it would cost you so much time.<br />Since sometime the classmates are quite competitive, you may feel pressure after exam.",
