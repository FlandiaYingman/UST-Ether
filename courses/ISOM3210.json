            "comment_content": "I believe you've all heard about IS majors being the 'bridge' between programmers and management. This course is precisely doing this. What I am going to mention below is universal and learnt by CS majors too. So if you want to learn something out of your degree or just get a good grade, take this course seriously<br /><br />This course teaches UML, an object-oriented approach (no worries if you haven't heard about this, cuz me neither before taking this course). You will learn about the major components of UML i.e. use case, elaborated use case (EUC), included use case (IUC), class diagram, sequence diagram and behavioural state machine (BSM) (in chronological order they appear).<br /><br />Let me organize them in 2 parts:<br />Part 1: Use Case, EUC, IUC<br />Part 2: Class diagram, Sequence Diagram, BSM<br />The reason is we don't have midterm (woohoo) so Part 1 is not tested. The final exam only covers Part 2. HOWEVER, part 2 is based on part 1. Also the project focuses on both parts, so you still have to understand the content. It's just that you can better understand the correlation between the content.<br /><br />Personally, I think the first part is harder, in the sense that it is the foundation for the whole case (the pre-recorded lectures and lectures are based on different cases), for people who have brain fog like me, it is hard to remember every little detail about each case and even our project. You need to understand your project and the cases really well from the flow of events (like the steps in a lab manual) in order to understand how the system interacts. So, I think revising should help if you want to master part 1. Part 2 is difficult in terms of the concept. You learn best through trial and error e.g. completing the cases on your own.",
            "comment_teaching": "Note this is in blended learning (BLD) mode, so only 1 f2f class/week, and you can watch pre-recorded lecture videos at home. Our classes are on Tue and Thu. Tue is optional Q&amp;A session for you to ask questions about the pre-recorded lectures while Thu is normal lectures with attendance (iprs).<br /><br />There is also lab which you must attend (bear in mind when composing your timetable) which covers the group project. Of course, it really depends on your group mates how important the lab is to you (no attendance), but please be a responsible one and attend labs ;)<br /><br />Xiaojun (everyone calls him like this) is a really friendly professor. An all-rounded professor lol. Very clear in his teaching (if you can't understand it right away, watch the recording again and you can probably understand it). Attends to students' needs: some students requested lectures to be recorded, and he did (so part 2 of the lectures are recorded).<br /><br />Chris is a nice guy. He is very very helpful in the beginning of the semester as in he answers our emails really quickly and in details. But maybe he's burnt out towards the end of the semester, his replies are like any other 'poor' TAs lol who doesn't really wanna help. Poor Chris :( Please treasure this good TA. Generally very helpful with your group project AND assignment as he grades all of them.<br /><br />For concept-related questions, approach Xiaojun, I think Xiaojun explains a tad clearer than Chris (though Chris is not bad either). Other questions related to project/assignments/admin, approach Chris. <br /><br />Big shoutout to them (dk if they would read the reviews) but I could really feel they want to help us learn and understand and tried their best to keep improving all aspects of the course. Feel supported by them throughout, instead of left alone floating on the sea like some other courses. So kudos to them!",
            "comment_grading": "Average grading I would say? Maybe leaning towards relatively good grading but still, not that easy to get A range (but this is just UST).<br /><br />1. Team Project 35%<br />2. Final Exam 30%<br />3. 2 Assignment 20% (10% each)<br />________________________________<br />4-5 are all credited on submission<br />3. In-class assessment 8%<br />4. Online learning and Exercise 7% (for the blended learning pre-recorded lectures)<br /><br />I will try to provide insight based on 1-3<br />1. Team Project<br />Not sure about what I attained for all as the scores weren't released. But I believe our group is par average for the group project as we got 12.5/13 for the first 3 deliverables of this project, but unknown scores for the 22% of final report. You get to from your own group based on LAB sections NOT lecture. So if you have friends you want to be in a group with, better communicate before course registration. <br /><br />2. Final Exam <br />Easier than I thought. The difficulty of the course progresses as it proceeds. The trial and error I mentioned comes from getting some questions wrong and learning from them. However, not much of these were tested in the final exam. Plus there is ample time, so many people left early. One reminder is to study about the CHMS case carefully as it is congruent with the final exam. Also make sure you understand self trigger and how to send an SMS (you will understand this as you learn the materials), as these were tested in the final exam. Otherwise, I think it should be fine.<br /><br />3. Assignments<br />Are actually hard. You get to work in pairs of your choice again. I worked on both independently :(<br />Test if you understand the content thoroughly. Better start revising earlier if you want to get high scores for the assignment. Slightly below mean for both<br /><br />Final grade: B+<br /><br />Given the difficulty of the content and my fair performance, the grading is fair. Which means you have to perform better than average in order to secure A range.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck!",
            "comment_workload": "Depends on your group mates I think. The project is hardcore given that it kickstarts in Sep and lasts until end of Nov. I think the project is important to secure a portion of your scores. No time limit like exam and you have peers to consult (and Chris!) so for peeps like me who probably am not an exam killer, project is a life saver in this course. <br /><br />As for the exam, plenty of materials you can go through. I&nbsp;&nbsp;counted and there are 5 cases in total (1. CHMS - commonly appeared in labs and lectures 2. Campus Housing System CHS - appeared in lectures 3. Clinic Appointment System CAS - also appeared in lecture 4. Dessert at Home DAH - case for both assignments 5. Dr. Chris - the ultimate mock exam provided towards the end of the semester and walkthrough in the last lecture). Although CHS and CAS are not covered in full as in no answers for all the components tested in the final exam, with the use case description provided, you can leverage them as a practice if you want. So I would say there is plenty of exercise you can do, if you wish ;)<br /><br />Pro tip: start earlier and make sure you understand everything (it's possible for this course and also paramount for good grade). Don't be afraid of the content, you can always approach Xiaojun and Chris if you've got any questions if you are lucky enough to reg into their course. Really recommend their teaching.",

            "comment_content": "This course is mainly about dealing with the design of a system, from the initial stage to the final stage. It is not about making a prototype, but to learn the &quot;behind scene&quot; development, including:<br />1. identifying all actors in the system<br />2. identifying all events happened in the system as well as to describe them step by step<br />3. identifying the relationships between all actors<br />4. drawing class diagram, sequence diagram and behavioural state machine diagram (ps the class diagram is something like the ER diagram in dse ict SQL module)",

If you had taken his ISOM2020 class before, you should know that his accent is really really terrible. It is extremely hard to catch up with what he said in class, but he is really trying his best to explain all materials<br /><br />But for the TA, I think she is very &quot;hea&quot;<br />There are 13 weeks in a semester and we only got 7 labs. For each lab, she talks very slowly, and especially the first and last 0.5 lab, she mainly talks about project, so the actual labs we got to learn is 5.5 throughout whole semester. You basically have to read the ppt yourself if you want to learn.",

We are only given some comments and will never know what we mistakes we got<br />AND!!! I HAVE NEVER SEEN PROFESSOR'S OR TA'S APPEARANCES!!!!! They never turn on the cameras in the zoom meetings and so do other students. That's why I would rate this course as &quot;transparent&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot;<br /><br />I got C+ at last for getting a hw below mean",
            "comment_workload": "hmm harsh...<br />There are two assignments in total since we do not have the mid term exam. The twos are related, we got to investigate a hero/enemy system...yes something like the monster game...If you are not familiar with these you gotta struggle a lot in the assignment, as some terms are confusing and not related to daily life scenarios...<br /><br />For the final, we have a take home quiz. We are given a day to complete it, but it took me around 6 hours whole to finish the diagrams...very time consuming...<br /><br />For the project, we gotta design a system and do a presentation. This can be very demanding if your group (like mine) held around 10 meetings (or more) in 2-3 months.",

But sometimes they may give opposite opinions so please judge by yourself.<br /><br />For the project, my suggestion is to start ASAP soon after your group's idea is accepted by TA.

Students may feel easy before the midterm because they only need to submit a proposal with brief ideas of the information system they are going to develop. However, it could be demanding to finish the final report and presentation, as most of the technical problems of the system appear here when you go deep to your ideas. Sadly, students are sort of being forced to be deadline fighters as the work follows the teaching schedule.<br /><br />Midterm and exam are not complicated, but students have to be very very careful and rational when doing the paper.",

He will help a lot with the group project and will give you helpful feedback. <br /><br />The course itself is in a blended mode, meaning the prof only uses one class in a week for teaching and the other day is for you to watch videos and study before going to class. <br />There is a lab once a week that you should attend.

The workload for this is fine since the prof gives a free block for you to work on that.",
