        "description": "Biological physics involves the application of physics to achieve an understanding of life processes. This is the second of a two-course series that will prepare advanced undergraduates for research and technical work in Biological physics. It covers advanced biological physics such as molecular and cellular biological physics, photophysics, single-molecule biophysics, medical biophysics, membrane biological physics, neurobiophysics, biostatistics, biomathematics, bioinformatics, computational biology and protein engineering. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically assess primary research literature written for a general scientific audience. They will also be prepared for mentored practical research investigations or professional job related to biological physics.",

Many people are afraid of taking this course and they think they cannot register because they do not fulfill phys1114 pre-requisite. But actually you can apply for waiving pre-requisite and take it. I would suggest everyone in LIFS taking this course as your LIFS electives. There are no calculus things and it is REALLY simple maths. You don't even have to worry about the physics. There is no force and electric and magnetic field calculation(those kinds of things). Prof will explain very clearly to you. Normal LIFS people could handle it. This course is nothing related to biph2010, so you don't need to worry.<br /><br />Prof Park<br />1. Scaling Law in Biology(2 lectures)<br />2. Light and Life(3 lectures)<br />3. Force and Life(3 lectures)<br />4. Single molecule biophysics(3 lectures)<br /><br />Prof Huang Pingbo<br />1. Biological physics of ion channels(3 lectures)<br />2.

            "comment_teaching": "Prof Park(course coordinator)<br />He taught well and explained all the ideas very clearly.<br />His part involves some calculations, but those were easy. Just prepare before exams and you can get those marks in exams. He would give a lot of hints for midterm exams, so you had better prepare for it(like Jablonski Diagram, calculation in Scaling law, etc .....). It is easy for midterm exam if you prepare for it. Just attend lesson and you can get good marks.<br /><br />Prof Huang Pingbo<br />He taught about biophysics of neurons.<br />Most part will be covered again in animal physiology(LIFS3040).<br />But his part differs a lot in calculation from LIFS3040. He taught a lot more in calculation for NEREST equation and also diffusion coefficient.<br />His part is the most challenging in the final exam.<br />You really have to do his homework and be careful for calculations. He will try to explain to you but he taught a bit fast. His part is long question in final exam. If you can answer his questions correctly, you must get at least an A as not many people get high marks in his part.<br /><br />Prof Zhu<br />He is ok at teaching, because it is very easy to understand. Just simple biology concepts. His part is easy and asked a lot of details. However, it is not difficult as it is just MC questions and those questions are straightforward.",
