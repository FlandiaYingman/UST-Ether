She usually review a bit on the lecture contents at the first, then goes into the python stuff for that topic. She usually reserve 10 min before end of lab for us to submit the in-class exercise.

            "comment_teaching": "Jason is definitely the best instructor I have ever met in HKUST although this is the first course he has ever taught and he is only a PhD student studying IS. He explains everything clearly and often gives insights into how the contents can be applicable to real-life contexts and may sometimes introduce how the application is used in his own company (yes, he is also an entrepreneur). You can feel he does know the topic very well and could answer every question that students raised. He is so helpful that he always asks students to send him emails when we have any questions and he does replies very fast during working hours (like replying within 15 mins, do appreciate that). <br /><br />Enough the appreciation above, his teaching of course does have some flaws. I think the biggest problem would be the pronunciation thing. This does not happen very often, but he sometimes pronounces a few words wrong (not because of his accent) and we may not know what he is talking about. Also, for the lab parts, sometimes Jason goes through the codes so fast that we can't really follow them. I think that is because he already typed all the code before the labs and he simply scroll through and highlight the codes and said, &quot;we have this line of code, so we have this result.&quot;, but I don't really understand what parameters do I need in the code (maybe that's because I didn't take ISOM3400 before taking this course?!). I think it would be better if Jason types the code with us in the lab so that we can type and follow will help us to understand the codes better.<br /><br />After all, although there are some flaws regarding pronunciations and labs, the good things outweigh the flaws and make him a very very good and thoughtful instructor.",
            "comment_grading": "Since the marks given in project are quite lenient, I guess everyone gets similar marks. It makes me 9x% still get a B+. I did expect a bit higher grade... I guess assignments matter most in differentiating the grades.",

I think it is manageable(especially it is Summer sem, it's kind of free in Summer). <br /><br />There are 2 parts in every assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;One part consists of about 5 MCs and 2 LQs. which is quite easy to complete as long as you are familiar with the concepts. Another part of the assignment is related to the lab (which is coding). We need to finish the task by Python coding. I think this is quite challenging for me, since I need to spend so much time in debugging and reviewing the lab(since I cannot really understand the coding in lab sessions as mentioned in the teaching part).<br /><br />For the group project, we are required to solve a business problem using data mining. We need to build a few data mining models and integrate and implement the results.",

But i attend almost all the real-time lectures and respond (by typing in the textbox) frequently. <br /><br />Homework Assignments *2 -<br />individual. some needs hand writing, just conceptual problems taught in the class. There are also coding tasks. The workload might be a little big because it's the first time for me to conduct a complete project (the 'Titanic' case in Assighment 1) by myself. But the grades of the coding tasks only depends on your efforts and logic (instead of accuracy) so just be relaxed. everyone can get nearly full scores in all assignments!<br />me: full score in all assignments except for one 90/100.<br /><br />Group Project-<br />They didn't release the score of group project. <br />tip: try to communicate with the prof and TA as much as possible! try to get feedback/advice from them (there will be 2 advising sessions). Knowing what they are expecting from you will contribute a lot to your work.<br /><br />Midterm-<br />I didn't do well in the midterm. The mean is 14.7/20, and I got 15.4. Only slightly higher than the mean.<br /><br />Final-<br />They didn't release the scores of final. The format is quite similar to midterm. MCQ, short answer questions (explanation, calculation). The time will be tight. Remember to manage the time!<br /><br />My final grade: A<br />As you can see, I only get mean in lab quiz, assignment and midterm. Although the score of group project and final are not released, 'A' is definitely out of my expectation!!! I would expect B or B+(if better). But eventually I got A! Really amazing!! Thanks Prof. Yang ‚ù§<br /><br />I'm a person who seldom write reviews in USTSPACE. But this time I seriously write a review for ISOM3360. Just want everyone to know how kind Prof. Yang is. Don't hesitate!",
            "comment_workload": "Although Prof.Yang gives amazing teaching and good grades, I would say this course has a heavy workload.<br />There are usually three hand-written problems in assignments and one coding task. For the first hands-on coding task, it took me a whole week! There are also weekly quizzes after the lab. The deadline is one day later at 23:59. It's really common to forget the deadline... I missed one. Luckily, the lab only takes up 5% in the grading scheme.<br />The most difficult part would be the group project. You need a large dataset. A complete data mining solutions from nothing! There will be no templates (like in ISOM 2600). You need to write every line of codes by yourself. It's important to team up with good guys... or it will kill you!<br />You also need to submit a report. Try to think of a concrete problem from your dataset. And utilizing data mining skillls taught in lab as many as possible.",

Talking speed may be slightly slow for me but I think it helped in clarity, and replaying online lectures can be in 1.5x speed anyway.<br /><br />The TA Sophie is also knowledge in the field and walks through codes pretty clearly. The downside could be she did not explain basic Python scripts so not everyone grasps what is actually going on, as COMP1021 or ISOM3400 are not prerequisites to this course.",

The labs have already provided most sample codes. It's easy to search by google to get some clues or simply ask the instructor if facing any difficulties in coding. I believe 2 days are enough for each assignment in average.<br /><br />It's better to start earlier for the group project. Our group spent around 10 days to finish the report &amp; coding.

Both the midterm and final exam include multiple-choice questions as well as short questions (descriptive and calculation), and the mean for the midterm exam was 85/100 with an SD Of 8 or so. The final exam statistics were not released, therefore I can't comment on it. <br /><br />There are two homework assignments which consist of 3-4 short questions, and the mean for these tends to be pretty high (e.g. mean of 1.95/2 for most questions).",

As long as you find good groupmates and cross your fingers that Azure runs quickly, the project shouldn't take too much time!",

For part 2, it is a hands on question where you are required to use Weka to process the given information and answer the questions. All the instructions are written clearly on the question so you don't have to worry not knowing how to extract the data.

You need to choose any business problem you're interested in, formulate it into a data mining problem, run ML algorithms and evaluate the model performance. You need to submit a report at the end.
