        "description": "This course provides an advanced overview of American politics and government. We will cover a wide range of substantive topics, including the constitutional foundations of modern American politics, the major American governing institutions (the presidency, the Congress, the courts, and the bureaucracy), the policy making process, political campaigns and elections, elite behavior, the behavior of ordinary citizens, foreign policy, and the mass media environment. We will also analyze the politics of a variety of contemporary social and political issues such as economic inequality, racism, polarization, immigration, and the rise of populism. We will examine each of these issues beginning with a historical perspective, and tracing their development through to the modern political environment. Each topic will be examined through the lens of competing theoretical perspectives.",

            "comment_content": "&quot;This course provides an advanced overview of American politics and government. Course material<br />is divided into three broad sections. The first section briefly covers the historical, philosophical,<br />and constitutional foundations of the United States. The second section examines the major<br />American formal governing institutions (e.g., the presidency, the Congress, the courts, and the<br />bureaucracy) and organizations (e.g., political parties). The third section covers mass and elite<br />political behavior and contemporary political issues. Throughout the course, there will be a<br />strong focus on relating the modern American political environment to the countryâ€™s founding<br />principles and philosophies, as well the historical development that led to the current status quo.<br />Most topics will be covered using both lectures and in-class discussions and activities&quot; --- Syllabus<br /><br />The content is very useful and interesting, providing tons of practical information for students to do their own analysis. The course material enlightens a comprehensive understanding on the US politics, from both historic and modern point of view.",
            "comment_teaching": "Before joining HKUST, David was a associate professor at LSE with tenure. He's on another level if you ask me.<br /><br />David is probably one of the best lecturers at HKUST, though he just joined in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's patient, tolerant and knowledgeable. His teaching style is clear and intriguing, with accurate explanations that are neither too much or too little. The methods and theories he taught in class can be easily applied in real life, most of the time you can even connect them to the news around us. He definitely opened another window for students interested in politic and the US. <br /><br />Compared to other professors teaching style (copy and paste a textbook's syllabus and testbank), David is a truly respectable professor that elevates the teaching standards in UST",
            "comment_grading": "Very nice grades, more importantly, very fair and transparent.<br />We all know how some professors in UST like to operate in a most opaque way. However, David is the opposite of them. He provides a clear, customized grading report after each grading. He provides calculation method and attendance record in the report, also providing strengths and areas for improvements in it. <br />I got around 1std above mean in both quizs and 90 in essay. Ended up in A range.",
            "comment_workload": "Reading can be a hassle if you're not interested. But the rest is very low workload, nearly 0.<br /><br />If you put 20% of the efforts studying any science subject, you can almost definitely get a decent grade --- after all, both quizs are nothing more than a test on the PPT and reading materials.",
