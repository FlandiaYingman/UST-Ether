I find the examples and lecture notes extremely helpful. The content before midterm is quite easy. As long as you listen,it will be fine.<br /><br />I think it's not challenging for SENG freshmen, especially those who want to major in CS or CPEG, better choose the other 2.",
            "comment_teaching": "I think both lecturers are nice and patient. They try to teach in a fun way and always give fun examples. To compare, David asks more questions while Cecia explains the logic of the code more slowly(so sometimes David teaches faster and give harder examples). <br /><br />For enrollment, maybe David's class's waitlist is longer and harder to get in. So you may choose Cecia's lecture, and go to whatever lecture you like.<br /><br />I enjoyed the lectures. Better bring your laptop to class to try the new things.Oops, better charge your computer before class! Coz there are no sockets in the classroom.",

Cecia ask questions sometimes based on a volunteer basis, if you raise your hand, you get chance!! And I am in Cecia's class, but the questions answered at David's lectures still count! so don't worry.)",

Optional lecture+optional tutorial(5 graded must-hand-in assignments)+midterm+final.<br /><br />There is no attendance-taking for lectures, and there will be lecture videos uploaded right before final period,&nbsp;&nbsp;so it's good for those who don't want to go to lectures.<br /><br />But if you go to lectures, the professor would pick some random people to answer questions and give bonus points (I looked through previous comments, maybe this is a new policy).<br /><br />I recommend you to go to the tutorials even though many people find it easy to finish on their own. You can ask TA any questions, and it secure you a full score on assignments(even though you are dumb on VBA thing like me). And for example, this semester, the last tutorial's work is not a hand-in-assignment, but an important question in the final is related to that.",

Another half of the course is also very easy to understand, such as looping and basic cell formatting.<br /><br />In fact, the course is so easy that you can understand all the lesson materials just by reading the lecture notes, you don't need to attend any lectures at all (in my opinion).",
            "comment_teaching": "Streamlined and Sophisticated.<br /><br />Gibson is one of the best lecturers I've seen (though to be fair as a year 1 student I haven't seen much), his lessons are interesting, used a lot of gags and jokes to stir up the atmosphere, he also uses very simple and easy examples to help students understand the concept of the class.<br /><br />Questions will be asked during each lecture and if you answered it correctly you will be awarded 0.5% towards your final grade.<br /><br />Each week they will have 1 lab, a mini-project/ homework that helps you understand the concepts and the implementation of codes. Without a doubt, those labs are very well organized, while doing the lab you're simultaneously learning and revising the lecture material. The lab is so good that if you've done all the labs you don't even need to read the lecture notes to learn the content.",
            "comment_grading": "This semester's grading is quite good in general.<br /><br />This course was regarded as one of the best courses in UST. Easy to learn with very high grades. However, this year is an exception.<br /><br />The course has 4 lab work, 1 mid-term exam and 1 final exam, by the way all exams are open book open notes exam.<br /><br />This course has two ways to count your final grade. I've forgotten the exact method, but basically, final exam counts around 50%, mid-term 30% and labs 20%. The second way is final 60%, labs 40%. The instructors will automatically choose the method that will result in a higher score.<br /><br />My score:<br />Lab total: 97.5/100<br /><br />Midterm: 62/100<br />Mean: 62.37<br />S.D: 24.22<br /><br />Final: 83/100<br />Mean: 48<br />S.D: 22<br /><br />My Total: 84.6%, Final grade A.<br /><br />As you can see the final exam is disastrous. Never have I seen a 1000 level course having a lower than 50% mean score. Bear in mind this is an open book exam. Though to be fair it doesn't really help even if you had your notes, since the exam had focused a lot on logical deduction which required a focused-mind and clear head. To conclude almost no revision is required, but you'd better make sure you're clear about the concepts of coding.",
            "comment_workload": "The only homework for the course is lab work aforementioned, better still only half of them are counted towards your final grade, which means there's only a lab work biweekly. <br /><br />Each lab work is a simple mini-project using excel spreadsheets that takes around 1 hour to finish, such as making a search up page for MTR fare. <br /><br />Lab project will be taught in lab sessions and you can finish that homework while attending that session. If you missed that session you have around 5 days to do it yourself and hand in via canvas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, each lab will have a sophisticated step-by-step guide teaching you how to write the codes almost LINE BY LINE. Even a primary student can finish the lab under that level of instruction.",

            "comment_teaching": "I absolutely adore Gibson.<br /><br />His lessons are really fun, and he can always take the seemingly complicated codes and dumb it down to a level that even junior secondary students have no trouble understanding the codes. A very good lecturer for absolute beginners in programming.<br /><br />He is also pretty knowledgeable in other programming languages, and is able to present comparison of VBA to other programming languages to help students determine which programming introduction course is the most suitable for them.",

The tutorials teach the labs (weekly assignments) step by step; however, the instructions given with the labs are already helpful enough. The pacing of the tutorials was slow and the TA could be a bit unprofessional, making jokes of a sexual nature. By the end of the semester, none of my friends nor I were attending tutorials.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading was fair for the most part. Your hand-in labs (4 in total), the midterm, and the final exam all account for your cumulative grade. <br />The hand-in labs should be easy marks, as you have a week to complete them and they come with very thorough instructions. <br />The exam format was a bit tricky, and to get a good grade you will need to be very careful with your proofreading and also have a bit of luck. Both the midterm and the final exams are open-book, open-note, and the content was not too difficult. However, if you have any syntax errors in your answer you will get marks deducted. In real life, you would be able to run the code and fix it.<br />The instructors will calculate your grade with the midterm grade included or excluded, and give you the higher mark of the two. For this reason, you can choose to not take the midterm.<br />The instructors also ask questions in class for bonus marks - 0.5% for each question answered correctly. This is an incentive to attend class.<br />However, I gave it a B because it is hard to get an A+ - the course is too easy.",

ICT students / those who have programming experience can definitely get an A range. A lot of ICT students take this course cause it's so easy for them. However, others may need to spend more time understanding programming concepts, so the grade distribution is rather unfair on some levels. Remember to ask for help.<br />I studied ICT as an elective for DSE, and since my then teacher made us write programs from scratch, I'm already very familiar with programming language and logic. Besides the first 2-3 lectures, I skipped all the others and still got an A.",
            "comment_teaching": "Rossiter is a very nice professor with great sense of humour. He makes sure the class can follow by talking slowly and using simple words, cause he knows programming can seem very difficult for beginners. He's very willing to answer your questions after lectures. It's always fun to attend his lectures.<br />Gibson was my TA for the lab sessions. He also talks through the labs in moderate speed and makes sure we can follow. Since labs only last for 1-2 hours, if you can't follow, you can always ask for help anytime without difficulty.<br />Rossiter says that it's necessary to buy his book, but I think it's optional. His lecture PowerPoints are definitely enough.",

Nothing counts attendance (besides mid-term &amp; final, of course), so you can stay at home and complete what's needed.<br />I could finish some lab sessions on my own, but I still attend all labs in case I've missed something important. Labs are the easiest way to get your grades higher. I got full marks for all labs, and the mean is usually 90-100 / 100. You can always ask for help from your friends who have finished their labs.<br />Mid-term and final are both open-book, so the tricky part is the logic. I recommend writing your own set of notes to keep things neat and easy to navigate during exams. I wrote within 20 A4 pages, which is much easier to navigate than those who brought the whole book + every single lab printout.<br />Rossiter is very flexible on mid-term and final grades. There are 3 ways to incoperate them into your final grade:<br />1) mid-term only<br />2) final only<br />3) some mid-term, some final (I forgot the exact percentage)<br />The method with the highest score is taken.

I think the hardest thing for most of the people is just the weird syntax of Excel VBA, recursion, object-oriented programming and the difference between &quot;procedure&quot; and &quot;function&quot;. So if you don't know programming, don't register this course unless you are a diligent person and willing to figure out many new concepts or have a friend who knows programming so you can seek help anytime.

This course often requires you to understand the program instead of just reading and writing some meaningless codes.<br /><br />Here's my result, not showing off but just would like to provide some reference.<br />Studied ICT and got 5* in DSE<br />Lab full mark<br />Midterm 97<br />Final 88<br />Bonus mark 8<br />Total: 95/100<br />Overall A+",

For this term one of them was about excel formula manipulating while the other two were about VBA coding, you need to do your code to accomplish certain tasks.

During lab sessions, the instructor will assist you in constructing your assignments step-by-step. If you attend all lab sessions, you will have about 80% of the assignments completed! The rest can be handled relatively easily with some straight-forward thinking.<br /><br />The exams are not hard as well.

Furthermore, you can always get the TA to help you with your assignments, just make sure you are really careful when writing your codes.",

Even if you have not touched these concepts in the past, they are pretty straight-forward and not difficult to understand.",
