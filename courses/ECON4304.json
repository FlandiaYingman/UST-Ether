Anyone who uploaded their own work before the deadline will earn full marks as long as they show reasonable effort. 問題係佢出呢份HW嗰陣咁啱同時出左HW2/3嘅分，之後個TA係會因為答錯答案而扣人分，咁姐係又要我地好認真咁做嗰份Review Question，唔洗溫其他科咩大佬.... 之後佢份solution仲要考之前幾日先post，重點係成份Review Question同final係一啲都唔似，成件事係極度反智。同埋佢midterm之前有個dry-run做完之後total score會加1%，咁如果你要incentivize，咁點解唔將份review question變做optional bonus呢?_?擺明就係自己出唔夠5份功課格硬變做一份graded assignment啦=.=<br /><br />TA(Xu Feiting)成個sem都冇開過一次tutorial，淨係考完midterm之後開過一次解卷tutorial，印象中好似仲多人過平時lecture<br />留意返佢好似專做4000level econometrics TA(4284又係佢)，佢做TA嘅話自己睇路",

Multivariate Time Series Models: Vector Autoregression (VAR)<br />Topic 7: Non-stationary Time Series: Time Trend and Stochastic Trend<br />Topic 8. Multivariate Time Series: Modeling the Long-Run Relationship <br /><br />I think it is kinda interesting, if you attend all lectures and spend some time after class to review the materials, you can catch up easily.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Ng is friendly and can deliver the topics clearly. Sometimes he also uses R codes to support his teaching. If you have any questions you can also ask him after class, he will be happy to answer them.<br /><br />Jeremy is also a very good TA. He is very helpful in assignments and exams. Remember don't skip any tutorials, codes in tutorials are very useful in exams.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework (20%): Three or four assignments<br />Midterm (35%)<br />Final Exam (45%)<br />both midterm and final are open book, but you can only check the lecture slides and the R codes that are uploaded on Canvas.<br /><br />Here are some details:<br />Homework 1: mean 93.33, median 95, me 100<br />Homework 2: mean 80.18, median 90, me 98<br />Homework 3: mean 79.91, median 93, me 100<br />Midterm: mean 74.35, median 72, UQ 88, max 96, me 93<br />Final: not released, but I'm sure I mess it up.<br /><br />Overall: A",
            "comment_workload": "Reasonable. There are 3 assignments and you really have to spend some time on it. Some questions are difficult and I spent around 5-6 hours on each homework. There are 2 parts for the assignment, midterm and final. The first part is theoretical, which you've to answer by writing the solution. The second part is analysis, which you have to type R code and get the results. No worry you don't have to type everything from zero. Basically you only have to copy paste the correct code from the examples.",

            "comment_teaching": "The professor would illustrate the econometric concepts with a lot of real empirical economic research papers done by the other researchers. This was very helpful for us to understand how could we apply the econometric models to real time series data. Overall, the professor's teaching was good but sometimes you would not be able to understand the equations just because they were really difficult. You would need to spend some time to read the textbook if you really want to fully understand the content.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading was fair but be aware that most of the students enrolled in this class were QFIN, MAEC and ECOF.<br /><br />My Scores:<br />HW1 (~8.33%): 10/10 (mean: 8.9)<br />HW2 (~8.33%): 10/10 (mean: 9.3)<br />HW3 (~8.33%): 10/10 (mean 9.3)<br />Midterm (25%): 98/100 (mean: 72.6, high: 98)<br />Final (50%): 85/100 (mean: 71.8, high: 97)<br /><br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />For the homework, just follow the lecture notes and you would be able to finish them. We used gretl to run the time series model. It would be more practical if the professor could teach us how to use R to run those models.<br /><br />For the exams, most of the questions were about the derivations of the time series models (AR, MA, ARMA, VAR, VECM and GARCH). To get high marks, make sure that you know how to derive the unconditional/conditional mean and variance, n-step ahead forecast and forecasting errors of the models. Some questions in the midterm were about monte carlo simulation.",
            "comment_workload": "The explicit workload was low because the homeworks were very easy to do. However, if you want to get a good grade, you will need to spend a lot of time to read the textbook and understand how to derive the formulas.",
