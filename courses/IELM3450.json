The questions in midterm are quite unclear and almost all questions are MCs, and full MC questions in final exam. The questions from the final exam are based on videos about final review, if you didn't study then you will be in great trouble. <br /><br /><br />Project 25%<br />Participation 5%<br />Online quizzes 5%<br />Class Practice 15%<br /><br />End up getting an C due to unexpectedly low result in midterm, which is the lowest 15%.",
