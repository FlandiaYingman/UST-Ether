She has been teaching for over 20 years and always explains complicated concepts really clearly (she even makes them sound super easy sometimes).

You can visit her during her office hours for extra questions and she will always be willing to help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anyone interested in branding/brand management/brand agency, you should totally take this course!!!",

She gives out feedback to each part of the report and the guidelines for the project are straightforward so it saved us a lot of time. <br />If you attend the lectures, you do not necessarily have to put extra effort into studying for exams because the professor prepares you well for the tests. <br />Just attend the lectures and follow the professor's guidelines for the projects and you should be fine.",
