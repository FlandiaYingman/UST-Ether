Topics covered include freehand sketching on paper, freehand sketching on mobile devices, illustrating the basics of perspective and orthogonal drawing, storyboarding, and visual communication. Students will develop skills in sketching both organic as well as geometric forms.",

And we learned how to draw 3d shapes, human figures, buildings, hands, random objects from daily lives, etc. They were all helpful in practicing drawing skills. Only thing that could be better improved is the quality of jpg files uploaded on canvas.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor is a skilled designer. He demonstrated the drawing in front of the class with some explanation and we had to copy his doing. The demonstration is not in detail but rather brief. However it was ok since the class was small and he roamed around to help students in need during the whole class. I guess this is 'learning by doing'. If he gave us a detailed explanation and guide I might have slept through class. So I preferred his way of teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "I personally enjoyed the class, barely was absent, and practiced most of the content given via canvas on my sketchbook. There were two(?) sketchbook check and one final exam as I remember. The exam was drawing 3d objects. It required perception of space and critical reasoning. The time was quite tight cause for me there were much to express and develop.",

Luckily not C (only one or two Cs, those people really do nothing). <br /><br />Though it only weights 1 credit, it marks the difference of 0.1 TGA. If only grading is really based on degree of improvement, I would be a lot happier. <br />Do not let 1 credit deceive you. It still has a solid impact. And I got impacted.",

Finally, you will learn how to design a project from your mind to reality.<br /><br />I listed my own summary of the lecture:<br />1. Line<br />2. Lines of different depths and lengths<br />3. Circle and square<br />4. Cubes and spheres<br />5. Copy the product image with the cube<br />6. Design and draw your products<br />7. Hand<br />8. Body<br />Since this semester is related to ISDN2300, many of the sessions will be devoted to discussing your design.",
            "comment_teaching": "Brian will tell you what to draw together, then give you time to contact each other and go through them one by one to tell you what the problem is. TA Natali will also help you.<br /><br />When discussing the design for ISDN2300, Brian will ask you to show him your own work and express your own ideas one by one. Since everyone is just learning to sketch and can't draw very good, Brian will let you speak your mind and help you draw what you want to do.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is not bad, but very subjective. <br /><br />Probably a lot of it is based on how well you draw, but is your design novel enough (that is, if Brian understands your design).<br /><br />My grade is B+",
