        "description": "This is an independent study course for undergraduates. We will cover some commutative algebra, including Noetherian rings and their characterization. Then we introduce fractional indeals and Dedekind domains. These algebraic technique are applied to the study of the rings of algebraic integers and finally we solve some special diophatine equations. Students should seek instructor's approval to take this course.",
