The first 30% of the course is more on SA common core related stuff such as the role of professional accounting in society, its institutional framework, and corporate governance (CG). The business ethics part is quite in depth, with discussion of fraudulent accounting practices in the now defunct Enron, industry practices and regulatory framework to ensure independence and accountability, risk management, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, etc. We are required to do a group project on this topic as well.<br /><br />The latter 70% of the course is just like a standard introductory financial accounting course, but stuff like T-accounting, accounting treatments of sales and inventory is removed. It's still quite demanding though - just imagine learning 80% of ACCT2010 with extra common-core stuff.<br /><br />I know BAFS students have learned all these, and some reviews said it was not even comparable to 1 year out of its curriculum. I wonder how they all managed to go through this sh!t in their high school - this is a crazy lot of content!<br /><br />Anyway I give this part an A cuz overall this course is well structured and good for learning.",

But as it turns out everyone in the class is getting more or less similar score, so it might not be as important as the percentage suggests.<br /><br />The 7% peer evaluation has a very special arrangement - it's designed to be a zero-sum game - every one of us needed to rate other group member based on a scale of 1 to 7, but on average within the group the score must averaged to be 4, so I couldn't give everybody full marks. If I gave one a higher mark, I had to deduct some points from another one. This certainly has some side effects when coupled with the P/F option this semester. In our group project meeting, we briefly shared whether each of us had applied for P/F, and what if some of us just gave the ones who applied for P/F lower marks (?)<br /><br />The Canvas midterm was quite difficult. It only covered the first 3 topics and comprised of 35 multiple choice questions and 1 long question on the income statement. I thought I screwed up, but then when I looked at the mean I realized everybody else did and it turned out I was still +1.1 SD above mean (Mean = 58.96/100, SD = 16.25).<br /><br />As for the project, I got<br />12/14 for activity plan (Mean = 10.4/14);<br />4.5/6 for presentation content (Mean = 4.4/6);<br />4.5/6 for presentation slides (Mean = 4.5/6);<br />9.5/12 for presentation skills (Mean = 8.9/12);<br />Unknown score in peer evaluation (Mean = 4/7)<br /><br />Unknown score in the final assignment.<br />Full score in classwork.<br /><br />Applied for P/F, and I received a Pass grade at the end. So I can't really gauge the grading.",
            "comment_workload": "The highlight of the course is definitely the group project on business ethics and corporate governance. It consists of a 12-min presentation and a plan of an interactive activity (e.g. a game, a role play) hypothetically designed for a class of 40 high school students. We are required to include examples related to our own major. Since the students enrolling in this course are mainly from science and engineering, the standard of presentation and delivery might not be as high compared to other business courses. Overall I believe this project is indeed worth working hard. I remember there have been some case competitions on corporate governance and ESG reporting, and at that time I had no idea what corporate governance was.<br /><br />Everything else was okay until the final assignment. This assignment was submitted near the end of the semester. It's super challenging, requiring us to read real financial statements in the Annual Report of Apple and give general comments of a company's financial position. The annoying part is that Dennis requires our answers to be hand-written on the answer sheets printed out from his template. I had to go to my nearby Âø´ÂúñÁæé, spend money to print out his template answer sheets, scribble 10 pages of trash on the answer sheets, go to Âø´ÂúñÁæé again to scan them back and submit them online. You can imagine how stupid this fucking thing is for me, a poor guy with a printer that just unfortunately broke down when I needed it. Another thing was that the 7 pages of answer sheet he provided were not enough - I submitted 10 pages at last...<br /><br />Other parts of workload include classwork (a total of 9 randomly distributed throughout the whole semester, READ: compulsory attendance), and preparation for the Canvas midterm.",

I think it will not be hard to handle for those who studied BAFS in secondary school before. However, double entry system is not applied in this course, so you still have to pay attention in the lectures. If you didn't study it before, you may consider to take this course or not as it may be a little bit difficult to digest and understand the accounting entries within a short time of period. <br /><br />The group presentation and interactive activity plan are related to the first two topics. It's about going to secondary school to give a 12-minute presentation and one-hour interactive activity to students like playing games or role play in order to raise their understanding on business ethics and corporate governance. <br /><br />The quiz covered the first three topics and actually it emphasised quite a lot on T3 which requires more accounting concepts and calculations. <br /><br />The assignment covered the remaining topics (except T8 as we didn't have enough time to teach). But to be honest, the questions are really complicated. They require you to comment on some situation or do calculations. You may need a lot of time to think how to work them out.<br /><br />Classwork are out randomly during the lectures. One mark is awarded for good efforts.
