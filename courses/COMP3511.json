I mean, if you just take the mean of everything you have 81.4%. So, the average score ought to be between 79-83%. My score is 87.2 but grade is B. That usually happens when mean is c+. Not a good grading for a compulsory course.<br /><br />My advise for exams is to take care of semantics/ calculation errors coz it is pretty easy to have them. For instance, I lost 6 marks because I forgot to add distance from head to first pending in disk scheduling seek time (I knew we needed to add head distance but I was in hurry and table starts from next pending job so I missed it. It was a very very regretful mistake) and 3 more marks because of calculation mistake. <br />Now, I will spend the holidays thinking that if I had double-checked, maybe I would have gotten b+ or more. :( Don't be like me.<br /><br />Better take the course in spring. From other reviews, I can see that the grading is much lenient. Moreover, if past papers are any indication, it is easier too.",

However, exam will more focus on conceptual things rather than factual or superficial things so you still need to comprehend the content.<br /><br />Make sure you know and master every algorithm (CPU scheduling, Banker's, etc.) in this course.

Sometimes the lecture notes explains vaguely or even only put some images or figure and explain nothing (like another post suggests, the lecture notes are very likely just copied from textbook= =).

Peter teaches well. Concepts are explained clearly. Also, Peter is in charge of the project assignment so you should at least attend his tutorial for knowing what is going on for the project.<br /><br />Fun fact, it looks like Peter is a big fan of Squid Game as his powerpoint shows a lot of Squid Game scene.

It is just an illusion of survivorship bias.<br /><br />People who give A to GRADING and said good grade is just because they get an A range in the course. If you look at their score, mostly are overall score 95% or above and get A+. That is equivalent to &quot;Your mother is female&quot;, which is useless and nonsense<br /><br />The truth is that the grading is ultimately crazy. Once your score falls below 90%, your grade drops very quickly, The interval of a subgrade is only like 1% to 2% (Reference from Goop, 89% B+, 87% B, 85% B-, 83% C+). Moreover, mean score is C+, a clear evidence of broken grading<br /><br />When you feel satisfied for making an overall score 80% and gets above the mean score, sorry you still get a C+ only. Grading is a complete disaster. The return is likely not proportional to effort so don't put that much effort on this course<br /><br />I got overall 85% and only got B-.

Project assignment <br />aka, programming assignment. You will use C (not C++) so try to get familiar with the syntax. All test cases will be given beforehand so you can debug more easily as there won't be crazy hidden cases to screw you up like COMP2011 and COMP2012<br /><br />There are two PA. Usually the first one will be something related to API and system call, which is very different from PA in COMP2011 or COMP2012 so it will be harder. <br /><br />But the second one, for this semester it is Banker's algorithm. Once you know how the algorithm works and the coding part is just same level as COMP2011 (some array manipulation)...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />3. Midterm &amp; Final exam<br />Since it is open-book, print every lecture notes out. Also, there are chapter summary (which I suspected that it is copied from textbook) available but they are not that useful, because the WHOLE PAGE ARE WORDS. You won't want to reference it during exam. Try to make more concise summary by yourself. Although this will cost you some time, when you finish making your own &quot;cheat sheet&quot;, you should have finished going through all lecture notes. It will be more efficient than just simply reading.<br /><br />Key thing for exam is : CAREFULNESS. After reading GRADING part you should know -- Careless mistakes can kill you very easily.",

More practical questions were added (some of them you won't see in past papers) and the Q&amp;A reciting questions become a little bit harder. Both midterm and final have the same mean score of 64.1, which is much lower than previous offerings. <br /><br />My stats:<br />HW1: 98/100 (Mean: 88.9)<br />HW2: 100/100 (Mean: 83.5)<br />HW3: 99/100 (Mean: 86.2)<br />HW4: 100/100 (Mean: 86.8)<br />HW Total: 397/400 =&gt; 19.85/20<br />Project 1: 143/143 (Mean: 125.1) =&gt; 10/10<br />Project 2: 80/100 (Mean: 71.6) =&gt; 12/15<br />Midterm: 85/100 (Mean: 64.1, SD: 16, Max: 95) =&gt; 17/20<br />Final: 86/100 (Mean: 64.1, SD: Not released, Max: 97) =&gt; 30.1/35<br />Overall: 88.95/100 =&gt; A<br /><br />+1.3 sd in midterm and similar results in final. I believe getting an A is quite fair. The grading scheme is much better than previous offerings, and you don't need 96% overall to get an A. The course has definitely improved. Maybe there was too much negative feedback last semester.",

Asking the TAs or reading the textbook maybe a good idea.<br /><br />For the HW, go google the questions. Do Ctrl-F in the course textbook. You may still get the answers wrong even you understand the concepts. Try to change/extract some keywords when googling. They have modified the wordings of some questions a little bit to prevent you google.<br /><br />The coding part of the projects are easy. However, for the report part, you don't know how detail you should write. I got low marks in Project 2 report because of that. So, go seek for some sources and ask the TAs for some opinion.",

This course is like a huge collection of &quot;fun&quot; facts about OS but I don't know why I need to learn them.<br /><br />Around 75% of the content are boring theories, jargon, and small &quot;fun&quot; facts about operating systems. Most of the concepts you learn won't appear in the following chapters. The remaining 25% are programming in C and calling APIs from the POSIX (UNIX) library. The programming part is kind of interesting though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />[The course syllabus is the same as previous semesters. Not gonna repeat here]<br /><br />Every slide is stuffed with many words and jargon that you need to remember. The slides are also poorly organized as they didn't put any dividers to indicate a change in topic within the chapter.<br /><br />This course is a large shit that every CS student needs to swallow. Just hold your breath and swallow quick, and you should be fine 😉",

He reads off words from the lecture slides line by line in monotone without much explanation. I highly recommend you to attend LI Bo's class since he is much better in explaining concepts.<br /><br />📃 TA<br />Other TAs are also human text-to-speech machines, except for TA Peter CHUNG.

Some questions can be answered by copying and pasting lecture note content, while some are more conceptual. Each HW should take you 3~5 hours so it's not too bad.<br /><br /> 📃 Project (PA)<br />PA1 is quite complicated as it involves POSIX APIs like fork(), but you can complete it within 3 hours. PA2 involves implementing a simple algorithm (Banker's algorithm). It's even easier than the PAs in COMP2111 and this should take you 30 minutes.<br /><br /> 📃 Studying<br />You need extra time revising the lecture notes since it is basically a clusterfuck of concepts, jargons and &quot;fun&quot; facts.

It is just a memorization competition.<br /><br />You may find the past paper is useful for you to do preparation. So get some of them to prepare before examination.",

            "comment_teaching": "Judging from no reviews about Charles in this course, I think this is the first time he teaches this course. I must say that despite the course having rather boring contents, Charles still tried his best to make changes to the course.<br />Firstly, Charles tried not to read everything from the slides and call it a day. He once used programming demonstration to explain the concepts of process, which I think is an advancement, judging from how lecture notes is probably direct copy from textbook (I will put my theory on this later).<br />Also, he makes coffee questions every lecture in order to make the lecture less boring, and, encourages students to self-study after lecture. He also set up a complain board for us to point out the problem of the course, and try to tackle them down.<br /><br />For the slides, it is a total disaster. Wordy, and the main points are all well-hidden inside the slides. To add insult to injury, when I search up for references to questions in homework, I found the slides of the OS courses in other universities, and they have exactly the same slide contents. Same examples, same images, and even some with the same theme (with dinosaurs at the corners). This is how I come to the theory that this course's slides are probably direct copy from textbook, judging from the textbook recommended to us also have a dinosaur as cover.",
            "comment_grading": "The grades is really broken, similar to COMP3111 in this semester.

In contrast, my heart simply died after trying my best to understand all the concepts and taken my best shot in exams, yet being played like an idiot in the exams and got a broken grade in the end.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload in this course is actually light. I downshifted the grade to D here because of the depression the exams gave me (This is personal, I know).<br /><br />Homework is basically quite easy if you ask. As most MCQs and the LQs can simply Google and find the answer. For the calculations and worked questions, just double check and you will be safe.<br /><br />PAs is also another easy work to handle. Since all test cases for the PAs are released and no hidden cases, just follow the lab slides and it can be done easily. Remember don't hard code as you need to explain how it works. The only challenge is your own sanity against segmentation faults without knowing why.<br /><br />For the exams, they are open book and non-accumulative. For the lecture materials, only chapter summary is enough. Another thing that is recommended to bring in would be the compilation of LQs from homework and past papers. For midterm, lab materials (Especially process and pipe ones) are also recommended.<br /><br />The midterm. Sorry let me put this personally. Who the F*CK come up with the idea on expressing a timeline in a TABLE????? Why you have to be WEIRD and not following the past papers and just use a number line to express real-time scheduling?????? Have you ever studied data visualization before??????? (Actually me neither, but I was just being salty so yeah) I lost 8 marks because I can't determine whether the column t = 1 means the instant right before t = 1 or the instant right after t = 1. I know I was being like an idiot in that, but oh well. I pretty much got a mixed feelings after the midterm marks was released. (The question is put at attachment, if you are curious)<br />OK, now to be serious. Since the exams are open-book this time, the questions this time are more programming based. As I am not familiar with the lab materials, another 8 marks was down the drain. As the exams of this course in future semesters are probably also open-book, so remember to study, and better bring the lab materials for the midterm.<br /><br />The final is basically similar to midterm, just a race of carefulness. Again, this time it also involves more programming. Since the final exam is non-accumulative and post-midterm labs are just lecture reviews, there are basically nothing special needed from the labs.",

            "comment_teaching": "Charles tries his best to make this course as appealing as possible. Like mentioned by the other review, he made an anonymous &quot;complain board&quot; (sic) for ways to improve the teaching, and he also tried to make students (at least f2f ones) actively revise by setting up bonus questions (which started as giving bonus course points but was scrapped due to complaints of unfairness for non-f2f students).<br /><br />I don't know how this course previously went, but judging by the slides (which Charles couldn't really do anything with) there's probably some improvement (e.g. skimming through the more &quot;trivia&quot; parts like how actual OSes implement some of the concepts). It is still a bit hard to revise properly because of that though.<br /><br />Labs? What are those?",
            "comment_grading": "...I'm not sure.<br /><br />The previous reviews all mention about this course being memorization only, so I guess it has been changed (mostly by allowing open-notes). It now depends on how careful you are with MCs, calculations and filling tables. <br /><br />Feels like it is very easy to lose points in both written assignments and exams due to carelessness (esp MCs), and those carelessness will very easily accumulate to a lower grade or something.<br /><br />I lost a lot of points in finals due to carelessness (and sleeplessness due to spending all time on other courses and only the night before the exam studying this course) and that alone probably net me a drop by one grade.<br /><br />As for range? I don't know. Didn't even remember my own score. Check out the other review on Charles, but I'm guessing A+ is like &gt;95 based only my estimation of my own score.<br /><br />Based on that data though, probably the curve is really squeezed in the high 80-100, confirming my &quot;a little bit of carelessness spoils your grade&quot; theory.",

The exam is open-note so there is not much to memorize.",

Additionally, not enough examples are discussed during class. However, some examples are provided during the tutorials, which can be beneficial for deeper comprehension. Therefore, attending the tutorial sessions or watching the recorded videos would be helpful in gaining a better understanding of the course material.",

The first project may require a considerable amount of debugging effort, but the others are more manageable.

It will come in handy when you study machine learning courses later, particularly for hyper-parameter tuning.<br /><br />The second half talks about how the OS internally organize memory and storage. It may be useful to learn the terminologies, but the algorithms taught in this part don't really have much practical use, at least for me.",
