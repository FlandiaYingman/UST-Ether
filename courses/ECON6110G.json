        "description": "This course emphasizes the psychological evidence as the basis for sound economic analysis. We will also insist on the importance of neoclassical theory as a successful benchmark that you are required to know. This course has largely an empirical orientation, and I will present empirical papers drawn from a variety of fields (here in alphabetical order): asset pricing, corporate finance, consumption, development economics, environmental economics, health economics, industrial organization, labor economics, political economy, and public economics. Integrated with the research topics, I will introduce and discuss identification strategies for good empirical research.",
