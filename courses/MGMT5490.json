The overall emphasis of this course will be on illustrating errors and biases in thinking and judgment and their managerial implications.  In other words, the class is designed to give you a \"rational mind\".  The concepts we will discuss are key to remove the obstacles in thinking, solving problems, and making decisions.  Topics that we will focus on include Common Biases, Experts and Novices, Heuristics, Judgment under Uncertainty, Nonrational Escalation of Commitment, and the Psychology of Delaying Decisions.",
