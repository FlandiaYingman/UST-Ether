Because it is a biochemistry course so the emphasis is placed on learning the structures and interactions of the molecules. Most of the concepts will be relatively easy to understand if you have a strong foundation from CHEM 1020 or 1030.",

He usually takes a 5 min break during the lectures and ends the lecture 5-10 mins before the designated time so students can ask him questions, he's very friendly and always answers the questions patiently. <br />Professor LIANG is quite good as well, goes through the content slowly and in detail. <br />Professor DANG is the worst among the three mainly because of his accent, it is so bad that you can barely understand anything he's saying. He tries to answer student's questions but sometimes students have no idea what he is saying.",

I think the grading is fair in terms of UST standard. <br />Quiz 1: 5/10, mean 5.8<br />Mid term: 49/70, mean 45.6, SD 9.5<br />Quiz 2: 9/12, mean 9.3<br />Final: 67/90, mean 58 (exact SD wasn't released but should be somewhere between 15-20)<br />Final grade: B+",

Maybe part of the reason is that he was undergoing quarantine at that time, but he really seems very unprepared for the lectures. He usually speaks as if he is chewing something (or drunk?).. don't know how to describe the way he talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus that the lecture time is always at noon or in the late afternoon, his lectures are quite torturous for me. I prefer reading the textbooks to really have a clear idea about the topic... But there will be more contents on the book than on his notes, so maybe it would be best if you can take a cross reference since he is only testing those on his slides. The contents he taught regarding DNA in this course is almost identical to those in LIFS1902 and even less thorough. My friends taking LIFS3010 at the same time said that it is good to take these two courses together as some contents (prof. LIANG's part) overlap. <br />DANG Shangyu:<br />Some people think his accent is unbearable, but I think it is acceptable. In my opinion, his lectures and notes are way more organized than prof.LIANG's. He always summarizes what we have learnt last lecture, teaches new content, and then gives in-class exercises for us to practice. The summary part is not on the slides provided, nor are the learning-checks, but he made the in-class exercise into one ppt and upload it and the corresponding answers for our revision before final exam, which is quite nice. He is also very patient to answer questions after lectures.",

(Cramming beore the exam is ok if you have to do this) For the midterm, the options can almost all be found on prof.LIANG's slides, changing several words (then wrong) or no change at all. He might talk about something not on the slides during the lectures. It is nice if you remembered it, but it will not appear in the exam. Just remember everything on his slides. For prof.DANG, the questions and options are also not tricky and basically just what appeared on the slides and taught in the class.",

Otherwise he likes to discuss some example review questions as well as mention everyday examples.<br />His accent is a little confusing sometimes, but mostly is perfectly understandable (a rare quality for profs at UST lmao)<br />He uploads lecture videos, so you can skip classes if you'd want to.

Most students say the protein part is most difficult because there are some equations to remember (not a lot), but overall this course isn't too difficult, I would say it was easier than 1902. The mid-term and final is non-accumulative . Also, the course itself has very clear learning outcomes and presentation, so it was very easy to study for. This course is necessary for all 3 LIFS majors because the information is very useful for each of them.",

He goes straight to the point and explains things very well. Even though he has a slight accent, his English is very fluent and he seems like he has a lot of years of experience. I highly suggest going to his lectures or watching the lecture videos - it saves you a lot of time because he is addressing a lot of the exam questions indirectly. <br /><br />Also, he gives a lot of class MCQs in he lecture (usually like in the beginning or end) and they end up being in the exam so it is an added benefit !!!",
            "comment_grading": "Quite fair, the professor has mentioned the top 20% getting an A, and subsequent 30% getting a B. The mean is around B-. Since the course is not difficult and the exam was easy, the mean is quite high and this makes it difficult to get a high grade. In my sem:<br /><br />- Mid term:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean= 50/90 , highest: 81/90 <br />- Finals:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean= 63/100, highest: 93/100&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The standard deviation for both is also quite high so you may want to make sure you remember every single detail in the lecture ppts. The mid term was only 90 MCQs, and the final was 80 MCQs and 20 points worth of short questions (which I find easier than the MCQs), but frankly at least 50% of the questions could be done without taking the course cuz its easy, and even after studying it 80% of the questions are just so obvious.",

The professor's teaching is fair but I think the mixed-mode is a kind of a waste of time. Many students do not attend f2f sessions and actually by just watching the lecture videos the preparation for the midterm exam is sufficient.<br /><br />Lectures 12 to 22 are covered by professor Liang Chun.<br />In part 2, professor Chun returns to typical one-way teaching which seems better than orthodox mixed-mode. However, still, this course is delivered in mixed-mode the professor asks us to self-study for the lecture contents and often omits the details in lecture slides that are required for the final exam.<br /><br />Overall, the two professors' teaching is fine but as the course is mixed-mode, there's some inefficiency in the teaching and delivery.",
