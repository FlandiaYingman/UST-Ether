        "description": "Deep learning models have demonstrated their effectiveness on a variety of domains and tasks. However, because of their black-box nature, deploying these models often leads to concerns as to their safety, especially in security-critical environments. This course covers different topics in emerging research areas to build a trustworthy machine learning system. Topics include Training-time integrity, Testing-time integrity, Confidentiality of model and data, Privacy, Safety and Explainablity. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
