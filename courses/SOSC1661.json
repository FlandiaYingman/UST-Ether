Sure its one sided, but all of his teaching materials are backed up with lots of statistics, public polls, and other empirical data. He also addresses and debunks claims from opposing side, so at least he isn't creating an echo chamber.<br /><br />Best part is when relates the lessons to current news affairs.<br /><br />Only criticism is he lacks planning. He spends too much time in the first few chapters only to realise he needs to speed up for later chapters.",

Students may have a better understanding of the development and critical issues of Hong Kong politics. It is one of the most inspiring course you may find in UST.

If you want to know more about the place you are born and bred, and don't wanna be a 'Kong Pig', take SOSC 1661. <br /><br />I think it is sometimes too difficult for foreign students and also mainland students to take this course as they do not have a solid&nbsp;&nbsp;ground about HK social issues, politicians and celebrities. It takes time for them to get these things recognised.",

Otherwise, you will lose your seat. <br />Also, I think we will not be able to see this course in the near future because of the political tension in Hong Kong and the fact that Prof. Sing is going to retire some time later.<br />Please cherish it while you can attend the course.",

Just be relax understanding and you will be fine. It is highly recommended to take the course if you want some extra understanding with minimal efforts and good grades.",
            "comment_teaching": "Lectures highlight the details from the notes and Prof Sing makes some interpretations and guidance on each topic. He also broadcasts some relevant historical videos from RTHK and other news agencies for further explanation. <br /><br />It may be too rush for him to cover all the lecture slides content during classes due to time constraints, while each chapter consists of about 50 pages, which maybe troublesome for some students with limited background understandings. However, Prof. points out the key points for us to follow better, and indeed you will find the linkage between different issues, making the story-line clear.",

For some questions from the readings, I make some blind guess since I didn't revise all the details. If I can recall the details, then I can answer. If not, just guess.<br /><br />Mark: 34/46<br /><br />Finally get an A which is out of my expectation after completing the exam. <br />Nice grade and nice learning experience.",
            "comment_workload": "Generally speaking, the workload is pretty low for a 3-credit course, you can choose whether or not to attend the lectures if you are able to handle the content yourself and make some background reading on the lecture notes provided. I personally skip several lectures but still that's not harm my understanding on the key ideas illustrated. <br /><br />I started revising the lecture notes around one week before the exams, the key of success is to know the key-points and the key figures, the general understanding is important but not barely recite the content. I didn't revise the reading materials, although the exam includes several questions on the readings, but attending lectures and common senses help.<br /><br />If you don't revise, Or else you will be like someone who always ruin his grade and yell wtf why you got nice grade all the time while complaining you are just a revision toxic jj, and even &quot;someone&quot; has taken the course previously, he can still think in an irrational way",

But from the lectures i attended, i could see that the professor has a very clear political stance (pro-democracy), but his teaching and content was not too radical so i thought it was ok. <br /><br />However his content is quite unorganised and there arent very clear topics and themes for each lecture. The lectures consist mostly of him showing us videos/documentaries about the negative things about the hong kong government.<br /><br />The main themes of his lectures is that authoritarian governments (e.g. china) are bad. As a local student, I find the content quite fascinating but I am curious as to how mainland students feel about his political stance and his teaching.<br /><br />Hope his course won’t&nbsp;&nbsp;be cancelled due to.. you know... meddling and interference...

The transparency of the grading system is really low since I can only know my own marks of the final exam without knowing mean and SD. The first option is also really risky since the final exam only consists 47 MCs and your grade relies on them. <br />Regarding the MCs, some of them had some vague words which confused me. For instance, one option in one of the MCs is ' A large proportion of people don't support the campagin'. It is really hard to define the words 'large proportion' (50%?,80%?).

Then move forwards to the governance of the past three Chief Executives with the Umbrella Movement as the last part of the course.<br /> <br />The professor has a very clear stand. If you are very sensitive to this(especially mainland students or pro-establishment), then probably you should not take this course.",

The questions were hardly related to course content. Only few of them I could trace back to the lecture notes. So basically everyone are doing the final with common sense. If you are very familiar with Hong Kong's politics or very good at liberal studies, then you are all fine.",

Most of the time he is very anti-government and he voices it out openly. Curriculum planning is not done properly. Some materials are covered way too in depth while others are shallow. He also seems much more interested and involved in his work promoting his views in the society (newspaper columns, interviews, protests etc) than in teaching.",
