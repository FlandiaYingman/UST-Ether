The class discussions are the main part of the class and it is important to understand how the professor thinks.",

In the one class and one online discussion forum per week, it is important to be present and make an impression on the professor.

Not only can cases help you understand, it is also interesting, like listening to stories.

However, I got an A+ in the end.<br /><br />In addition, as for the final individual project, you can do it whenever you want within the period from the beginning of the study period to the end of the exam period.

While stuffs in readings would not be tested in exams. After the mid-term, I read no materials and just gave them up. So, make sure you &quot;digest&quot; those notes well, and read them thoroughly before you go to the exams.<br /><br />To achieve A range in this course, just pay attention to what professor said is more than enough.
