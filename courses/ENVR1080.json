        "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

You better study this course with your friends to ensure no one is freeriding. Having a freerider in your group like I did would not be ideal at all. You would have twice the workload as you have to rework everything over and over.",

She will tell you which set she would like when you present.

Then for essay and review questions, i took about 6-8 hours for each of them. If you are taking several courses or have other activities during summer, this course may not suitable for you. For participation, i mostly answered questions in zoom chat box. The professor accepted this kind of participating&nbsp;&nbsp;.But i joined all the real-time classes at school. There are a few (4-5) students are super active on classes. I guess they should get full mark. I got about 9 among 10.<br /><br />The group projects are important. You can choose your group mates in case you are studying with you friends. If meet freeriders..... then you may need to finish the whole project yourself.",
