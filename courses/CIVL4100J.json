        "description": "This course will cover economic principles and tools for analyzing the emerging challenging problems in the context of Civil Engineering with a focus on smart city development. The course discusses various economic problems arising in modern power and transport systems through the lens of buildings, electric vehicles, renewable energy, mobility-on-demand services, etc. It also touches upon the nexus across distinct smart urban sectors for efficiency-improving system integration. The course will complement the existing course in microeconomics by focusing on engineering applications and offering extensive practical examples within the smart city context. Through lectures, project and reading, students will learn state-of-the-art models and tools to identify, formulate, and address challenging problems in smart city development.",
