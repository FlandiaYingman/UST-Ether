        "description": "Decision making is a central human activity, but how good are we at it? Scientific evidence suggests that our decisions are often biased and flawed, resulting in disappointing or even disastrous outcomes. This course draws upon contemporary research in psychology and other social sciences to better understand how it is that people make decisions, and why those decisions are often made badly. The course will emphasize a theoretical understanding of human decision making, as well as a comprehension of the real world implications of our mistakes both for us and for our society, and what, if anything, can be done about it.",

And the exams were all MC questions.<br /><br />For the presentation, as long as you get good teammates (not freeriders) it honestly wasn't a lot of work to do, in fact it was quite fun throughout the project period.<br /><br />As for the participation part, you just need to answer Carmen's questions in lectures (best to answer in every lecture) and also ask questions to other groups during their presentation, then you should get most if not full mark here.",
