            "comment_content": "Sorry, but I am going to be highly biased and leave a critical review here, because a lot of reviews here make it seem like it's a pretty normal course. However, I am going to speak from the perspective of an average student who got a B in COMP1021 and had no prior experience in C++ before this course. I also have a victim mindset from this course.<br /><br />This semester they didn't go through in detail the 'basic' lecture notes because apparently, people were complaining that it was apparently too boring. If I remember correctly, they told us to self-read these lecture notes one at a time before each next lecture and skimmed through during lecture time.<br /><br />http://2011video.cse.ust.hk/videos/list.html<br /><br />People may question why I went through these videos, but the lecture notes are almost the same and it's from about 10 years ago. 10 years ago Prof Mak took 5+ hours of quality lecture time to introduce C++ while these instructors told us to read it. I guess I am being dramatic because these beginner materials are not hard at all and they did go through it briefly. Oh well, but there's more shit to self-study later on. <br /><br />The other lecture topics, aside from those in the link<br /><br />Problems for Basics and Control<br />Function I<br />Array<br />Function II: Recursion<br />Scope<br />Function III: Miscellaneous<br />Separate Compilation<br />Struct<br /><br />Pointer<br />A YouTube video single-handedly made me understand linked list, a sub-topic of this pointer topic.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5wJkJJpKtM&amp;ab_channel=PaulProgramming<br /><br />C++ Class<br />Stack &amp; Queue<br /><br />Self Study Topics ( for one lab ) ( not tested in exam )<br />File I/O<br />String<br /><br />For each had optional tutorials.<br />For me I attended both simultaneously because of time management problems, but they weren't that helpful either. But I don't know, the information given in the lecture notes were not that helpful for the lab either.",
            "comment_teaching": "To be honest, Professor Li is may be passionate. If you think about some instructors, they are indeed capable enough to transmit this curiosity and passion to students. My opinion: Professor Li unfortunately did not have this effect on me.<br /><br />An immense number of times in lectures, she would go on and on about some part. Her monologues were detailed, but not concise. One thing that would tremendously improve her lecture is live speech-to-text conversion because my attention span could not remember the run-on sentences that she articulated with. She does have a plethora of knowledge to share.<br /><br />A fact: at the last class, there were less than 10 students in the face-to-face lectures. Around 15 students on zoom. And I still wonder to this day how the were the other 65 students were doing.<br /><br />I honestly did not know how to attend her lectures for the first half of the semester. After continuous effort going to lectures with a notebook and pen, seeking to draw some clear points being productive and shit... nearing the end of sem, I just sat and listened to her talk. It was actually much better because I got to at least focus on her words more clearly.<br /><br />It seems like they are recording the lecture but they are not published. Then what's the point of recording it?? <br />Please, I beg you, please, can you please, could you just make it easier for students to access these&nbsp;&nbsp;information not just for students who are not in HK if you recorded it please?<br /><br />An D to the teaching at the end because of the culture that they spread, which is honestly not even about plagiarism but about collaboration. They are so strict with plagiarism that they don't allow you to get explicit help from anyone in this course, which sucks, because I was stuck at certain tasks for days. Collaboration is pretty much discouraged. I mean, truth be told, it didn't really affect me because I had no friends but at the same time, I felt very reluctant to ask for help as I thought the help I would get would not be specific enough or whatever. I felt isolated. My opinion.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading? I don't have anything to say. It's fair, for the ability you show, not necessarily the time you spend. That is sort of true with every course and that's no revelation.<br /><br />I legit couldn't care any less about the so called competition in this course because the only competition there is, is for those smart people who wanna get A-range. I just wanted to get a B or a C.<br /><br />Most of the contents of the exam seems to focus on the big, later lectures including pointers, stack/queue, class, struct. Recursion and array are&nbsp;&nbsp;important too. The broadness of topics is actually not bad.<br /><br />Realistic stats<br /><br />Quiz 25/35 Mean: 27 or 28<br />Finals 26/100, mean: 49/100 or something.<br /><br />Assignments<br />PA1 88/100, mean 88/100<br />PA2 59/100, mean 71/100<br />PA3 88/100, mean 84/100<br /><br />Every semester, they make 1 or 2 of the PA more difficult/easier or whatever. PA2 is harder this year.<br /><br />Lab<br />10/10<br /><br />Grade I got: C<br /><br />It's not bad actually, I thought I would be given an F after that finals. I don't even know how you would study for finals. For me, I spent 60% of time revising the lecture notes and going through the examples inside and 40% doing 2 past papers so don't do that.",

The main problem with me is that I did not try hard to seek for help so<br /><br />TIP: Use the piazza when you need it. Go to office hours if you are truly stuck. The first time I got into office hours, the TA was not strict about straight out giving me solution for first task of a lab.<br /><br />I remember in this semester spending 5 days to do PA2, that seemingly other people writing these reviews can do within 3 days. Yet I could not finish that assignment and I got 59/100. Fact: I went to counselling because of the hopelessness I suffered while doing the PA2. Fact: When I looked at the answer to PA2. I had two thoughts:<br /><br />1. What is this?<br />2. I am satisfied because I would never be able to think of such a complicated solution.<br /><br />TIP: TO be fair, considering you start really early when the PA is given out, like 2-3 days after it's published, maybe you could finish the PA without so much pressure.",

Maybe I am just a butthurt baby but seriously, this typing code on Canvas (without being able to use Tabs or a separate text editor) is so time consuming. Plus, you have to remember all variable/class/function names otherwise you spend half your time scrolling back and forth from the code in the question and your code box. Many of the questions basically required you to write an algorithm to perform certain actions like shifting all the elements in a 2D array (without any indexing, only pointers) but you have to dry run everything in your head. Like when and where do you ever have to dry run such a complex algorithm in the real world?!??! A programming course shouldn't even have a final exam, but rather, have really hard projects instead.",

You will thank me after.<br /><br />if you are CS students like me, unfortunately, this will be your destiny to stay here. Above mean is definitely not enough. Upper quartile may even give you a B+ or B. Please be at least above 1SD in order to get A-. Given all CS students requires 3.7 gpa to enter, getting above 1SD among these good students is something difficult.",

Mean is C+ wtf?<br /><br />For me, I understand the SD in COMP course is large. But, if a students get all the thing above mean, and except midterm all my work are around upper quartile or full mark. I think B+ is not an unreasonable demand.<br /><br />Every CS students are already 3.7 or above, you even have strict curving for these good students.

Anyway, if you are already proficient in programming fundamentals, you probably have the skills to clear all the tasks in seconds.<br /><br />As for the assignments, I took more time on reading the instructions than writing the actual code lol. You gotta be careful in order to fulfill all the requirements man.<br /><br />If you do the labs with heart, read through the lecture notes, and practice with past papers, I guarantee that you will do great!

Basically it covers all the basics of c++ programming, i.e., array, string, recursion, pointer, class, etc.<br /><br />It is not hard in the beginning as it is quite straight forward and your should cover those ideas in COMP1XXX. Things start to become harder when it covers recursive function, and the difficulties comes to its maximum at pointer.",

As far as I know, this course is very competitive so if you really want to get a good grade, you have to get almost full mark in all the assignments as well as exams.",

However there is no plagiarism checking for labs so you can simply copy the code from your friends or even from online, yet doing it by yourself is still highly recommended.<br /><br />The programming assignments(PA) is the main workload during the semester, they are significantly more complex than the labs, so you probably need more time to finish them. In general, I highly recommend to start working on it once it is released because I don't think you can use one day to finish the whole PA, especially for the later ones. The first two PAs are not that hard so most people get full marks in them. However, PA3 is really disastrous and mind-blowing, you probably need to spend a lot of time to understand the requirement even you start to code anything for it. PA4 is less difficult than PA3, but it is still hard. Generally speaking , the workload of the PAs is quite high, especially for the last two PAs, you probably need to spend a lot of time in grinding it if you really want to get full mark in all PAs.<br /><br />P.S. Don't try to copy directly from others for PA, it definitely doesn't work in the way you want.",

As for PAs, approximately 1 day for problem reading/understanding, and coming up with some brief ideas of solution in your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual implementation takes roughly 2-4 days, debugging is usually the most painful part(crying internally). Do start early so you will have time for revision. We had a lot of recursion problems this semester and &quot;thinking recursively&quot; is the key to tackle the problem. <br /><br />3. Final: Though I got a shitty grade but I really did try HARD for exam prep...remember to finish all the past papers and be familiar with all the ppt contents! Just try to fully understand how all the concepts work and remember it, I mean by being able to type the whole structure down from scratch. You may cry yourself to sleep after the final since it's way too damn hard but you'll be fine if you tried hard enough, trust me. <br /><br />4. General advice: First, practice typing all the coding examples on the ppts by yourself, merely understanding is far from enough. Second, when you feel like dying and really cannot compose shit then just go to Piazza to ask for help or ask that kind friend of yours to give you some feedback/support. Just never give up and believe you can surely do this, you can definitely defeat COMP2011. Good luck!!",

This also means that if you have spent time writing code you would probably do slightly better. The exam was also formatted poorly, meaning you have to scroll up and down just to even read the question, and you have to type code in the CANVAS message box, which gives you no option to use tab to space out your code, and no other formatting options.<br /><br />However none of these really mattered since the final was outrageously difficult.

I think they do all these INTENTIONALLY to limit our time. Three tips for people taking this kind of exam later:<br />1. Write your code in recursive ways (usually iterative way cost more time)<br />2. Be sure that you can write all function taught in class without much thinking...they examine some functions like deleting linked list which already stated in the lecture notes :)<br />3.

PA3 is a disaster and it takes me over one week to finish it and do memory-leak checking. PA4 is easy and it takes me a weekend to finish it.<br />Under normal circumstance, only 3 PAs should be given.<br />Treat your labs and PAs seriously since it definitely helps your understanding of the concept and logic behind.

Here is a snapshot of the syllabus:<br /><br />Basics (main, namespace, data types, constants)<br />- Control (For loops, switch statements, enum)<br />- Functions (declare and call functions, pass by value &amp; by reference, return by value &amp; return by reference)<br />Struct<br />- Cpp11 new features (general initialization using {} list, range for statement, lambda expressions)<br />- Scope (File, function, block scope)<br />- Pointers<br />- Arrays<br />- Recursion <br />- Class<br /><br />All of the content is very practical and up-to-date to modern C++. It helped me understand the entire syntax and how C++ works in general. <br /><br />Everything starting from the basics until functions should be pretty fundamental and easy to understand if you have taken a previous CS introductory course. <br /><br />Topics from Struct to Scope should be straightforward as well, just pay attention to the specific syntax and how the features are used and you should be fine. <br /><br />Starting from pointers, things are getting slightly more difficult as you are expected to know how they relate to normal variables and arrays and memory manipulation. For the last few lectures, you need to know how all the concepts come together as you will be expected to implement them in the exams.<br /><br />Overall the content is great and very appropriate.",

To be a good programmer, you may devote certain amount of time to learn some tricks behind the C++ features to write good program, and that's the workload I refer to.<br />Of course, if you enjoy learning programming, you won't find it tired and time-consuming.<br />But as a deadline fighter, i did a large amount of drilling in recursion and class 5 days before final, and i finally realize how my assignment 3 should be implemented.

            "comment_content": "I believe the course adequately teaches a lot of basic programming skills and gives you a decent understanding of beginner level C++. For someone who has started out with python, a lot of the course contents will be very new and hard to grasp. Although the course mostly tests your coding ability and not your C++ knowledge, integrating these new concepts can be quite difficult. Some topics such as functions or recursion will be familiar, but they are already a big step up from what you will learn in first year courses. So, when topics such as pointers that don't commonly exist in most other languages come into play, most people have a really hard time wrapping their heads around them. Therefore I suggest not expecting a high grade from this course if you don't have any prior experience (besides introductory python course) OR you don't intend to invest most of your time into it. As a side note, if you are intending to take this course in the future, I highly recommend taking Java first.",
            "comment_teaching": "Although Professor Brian Mak has a nice way of teaching concepts quite well, I found his pace to be very slow. This was evident by the fact that we were many lectures behind all other sections.&nbsp;&nbsp;His speech and his tone of voice are too calm and slow which personally makes it hard to concentrate for more than 10 minutes. But besides his pacing, he is actually very interactive with the class and explains concepts nicely, although sometimes he explains the same thing too many times.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is heavily weighed towards the exams. You can expect most people to get full marks on the labs, which in my case left only the assignments and the exams. Assignments were 8% each, meaning as long as you get 90+ it shouldn't affect your grade too much. Here are my grades for reference:<br /><br />Assignments (Average): 95~/100<br />Labs: 3/3<br />Midterm: 91.5/100<br />Final: 80.25/100<br />Grade: A+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is quite light overall but very compactly distributed. There are 3 long Programming Assignments, but you are given 2 weeks to complete each of them. It might sound like a long time, but with the debugging it can take several days to complete which can be hard when combined with other courses. The assignments themselves were (for me) hard to get full marks (but not hard to get good marks) on because they are quite expansive and it is hard to get past every hidden test case (i.e. your code isn't smart enough to fit every scenario). <br /><br />There are also labs every week which take around 5-10 minutes to complete.

If it was a 3 cred course, I would give an E.<br /><br />Nearly every week, you need to hand in a lab homework which cost you a few hours per week. And throughout the semester, you got to do 3 Programming assignments (PAs), each of which gives you about 2 weeks to work on. And then of course you have a quiz/mid-term, and a final exam. Because of COVID, the tests were all done on Canvas. <br /><br />I would argue this course should be called as &quot;Introduction to OOP and Algorithm&quot; instead, because you always need to think of different algorithms to make your program work in labs and PAs. As someone who has nearly 0 programming background (I only took VBA 1022q before), thinking algorithms on a whim is challenging to me. It would be ideal if you can find someone to work and brainstorm together, because that's what I did to secure my PA scores.<br /><br />Again, as someone who has very little programing background (I am a SBM student), the concept of recursion overwhelmed me a bit when I first learned about it, but later picked it up with the help of friendship. Surprisingly, I don't find pointer really hard, it is just confusing sometimes when you assign a lot of pointers, such as a binary tree structure, so make sure you have a crystal clear flow of thinking.<br /><br />For the final, make sure you do past papers, review your past Labs and PAs, and remember how each algorithm in those questions work, because they can be very useful. However, as the exam was done on Canvas, you cannot use tab on the text editor, and for this semester, we were required to leave comments on our code, which could be very time-consuming, and causing many of us cannot finish the exam.",

Topics include Basic if-else logics, loops, functions, arrays, recursion, struct, pointers and class. Compared to CSE introductory 1000 courses, this course is much more advanced and demanding towards logical thinking and computation. The topics before mid-term exam are considerably basic while those afterwards are much more vague and complicated, especially with recursion and&nbsp;&nbsp;pointers which are very logical.<br />Lab assignments are compulsory and follows closely the contents taught in lecture. Some lab assignments, especially with recursion and pointers quite difficult.",

Revising for vague and complicated topics like recursion and pointers required completing many past exam questions. This is not an easy course, and there is no work around it, so put more time and effort to get good results.",

I personally skipped most of the lab sections and submitted the exercises on Canvas.<br />Quizzes are not heavy loads for me as I gave up all of them and all in final instead.<br />The final exam is quite challenging so it takes much time to prepare for. As I had the MATH 2033 exam one day before, there was not too much time to prepare the exam for the COMP 2011 and I suffered from it.<br />In all, the workload of the course is quite heavy, especially for labs involving higher-level knowledge such as pointers and linked lists.",

Final (36%)<br /><br />The quiz is during the beginning of the semester and quite easy if you have some back ground as not much has been taught. <br /><br />The Mid term is like a final exam because the paper is for 2 hours and the full mark for the paper is 100. In our batch the mean was 54 which is quite low. The paper was quite tough.<br /><br />The first Assignment is 5% and is quite easy. The second asssignment is 9% which is hard and the final assignment is worth 10% which is the hardest of them all.",
            "comment_workload": "The work load at the beginning of the semester is quite low but it increases exponentially. The labs get harder as you reach towards the end. The first assignment is quite easy and you will think all of them will be easy but thats not the case. The assignments get way harder later. The worst thing about the assignment is that you will have to do labs simultaneously with the assignments. If you have two weeks to do an assignment that means in those two weeks you will have to do two labs as well. As i mentioned earlier the labs get quite harder later so it consumes time as well. I think the work load is quite high for this course.",

            "comment_content": "This course will teach fundamental CS and OOP concepts by using C++, including functions / array / scope / structures / pointer / class / stack and queue / new C++11 features (added this semester).<br /><br />For pointers, we have to learn about linked lists too, and of course these will come along with recursion (functions), dynamic array, memory allocation and leakage.<br /><br />The regular 11 labs were about:<br />1 - Basic C++<br />2 - Basic I/O<br />3 - Nested Loops<br />4 - 1D array<br />5 - 2D array<br />6 - Recursion<br />7 - File I/O and string (not accessed in final exam)<br />8 - Structures<br />9 - Pointer<br />10 - Dynamic array and linked list<br />11 - Classes<br /><br />Midterms accessed you from basic C++ to functions (recursion, overload, pass by reference, declaration and definition)<br /><br />Final accessed everything except file I/O, C++ strings and queue structure type.",
            "comment_teaching": "Cecia is one of the best tutors I have ever met. She can teach many things not mentioned on lecture notes, which is helpful for you to clear concepts. She will also demonstrate and explain about the examples given on lecture notes (which unfortunately lacked explanation)<br /><br />After lessons, students could still approach her easily. You can even find her after lesson times to ask about this course's materials.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading scheme is as follows:<br />Quiz at beginning of semester: 5%<br />Regular lab practice every week: 10%<br />Programming assignments * 3: 24% (6+8+10)<br />Midterm: 25%<br />Final Exam: 36%<br /><br /><br />Quiz: Full Mark 25, Mean 20.00, SD 2.91.<br /><br />Lab: Basically everyone got full marks.<br /><br />PA: Most people got 80 or above for the 3 assignments. The guidelines were not given explicitly, but as long as you follow the requirements strictly, you should be able to get fair marks for the 3 assignments.<br /><br />Midterm: Mean 60.1, SD 18.5. 4 past papers from recent years will be given on the course site, which can allow you to preview what to expect in the exam. The exam was not too difficult, and people could get up to 99/100 marks in this semester.<br /><br />Final: Mean 55.4, SD 22.0. Similar to midterms, you can get 4 past papers from recent years too. You were given 3 hours to complete 11 questions (first question consist of 10 T/F parts), and questions related to pointers / linked lists were fairly difficult.<br /><br /><br /><br />The grading was quite fair I think. I got 92.5% (above 1.8 SD in midterm, 1.7 SD in final) in total and resulted in A+; people claimed that getting above mean can already give you a B+.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is quite large, even for a 4 credit course. There are 3 PAs, 11 labs, midterm and final exam for this course.<br /><br />For the first 3-4 labs, you only have to spend around 30 minutes each, but for the later labs, you may end up spending above 1 day to complete the lab, which was a waste of time. However, as the coding for the labs would not be checked, many people ended up copying others' code for the regular labs.<br /><br />For the 3 PAs, the difficulty grew exponentially - the first PA was fairly easy and could be finished in 2 hours, while the 3rd PA took me more than 3 days to finish.<br /><br />You had to go through all lecture notes thoroughly for the midterm and final exam.",

There are only 3 in the whole semester, but you put in ~ 3 days for the last one.

But there will be around 10 mins teaching session before checking. For the teaching part, he always put some meme in his powerpoint and make the tutorial less boring. For the checking part, I had made a mistake in my program once. He can point it out and let me understand what's is wrong in a short period of time.

It's ok if it's not some long code.<br /><br />For the long question, it's insane. The question is like a long eassy pasted on the Canvas. The question is listed at the top and the answer box is listed at the bottom. You will need to scroll downward&nbsp;&nbsp;at least 2 - 3 times (using your mouse wheel) to reach the answer box. The question ask you to fill your answer in the blank. But, actually you need to copy the whole things from the question to your answer box. However, the question is not a text that you can copy, but an image. So, you need to scroll up 3 times, remember it, scroll down 3 times, write it, fill in your answer, scroll up 3 times, check it again, scroll down 3 times, check it again. Then you finish the part a) (i). That mean you need to repeat it for many many many time to answer a single long question.<br /><br />It seems that it is not my personal problem as the mean is really low even though the question is not that difficult.<br /><br />For the Exam, the mean is 39.8.<br />For the Assignments, the mean is always around 8x% while there are always &gt;200 students in my lecture group get full marks.<br /><br />So, I truely hope that you don't need to take the exam on Canvas.",

Getting almost fullmark on PA and Lab is a necessary but not sufficient condition for most students aiming for A+, unless you do a really good job on final. For the rest of students, don't get too nervous on final. As long as you do the lab and PA BY YOURSELF, I think at least A range is secured. In this semester's final, about half of students are below 40/100. Comparing it to the statistics of PAs, I have sufficient reasons to believe that a large portion of them did not finish the labs and PAs independently. As the exercises provided by the teaching team are far less than enough, please make use of every chance you get, not just wasting them by &quot;Legal Communication To Other Students&quot;. According to my friends' and my scores, the overall cutoff between A+ and A should be around 87.",

The time I spent on checking my PA submissions is twice more than the time spent on writing them (though it is actually not necessary). There is a special point worth being mentioned: write all your codes on txt file and force yourself finish them onethrough because in the exam, you have no opportunity to check your codes by compiling them and no hints about syntax will be given. If you cannot overcome the anxiety during the exam due to the above reasons, you may be crushed and get a suck score. In f2f mode, the coding part is very likely to be hand-written, which also take you some time to get familiar with.",
