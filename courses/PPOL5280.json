        "name": "Economic Reasoning for Public Management",
        "description": "Public sector managers are tasked with handling a wide range of issues with economic implications. These issues often involve the allocation of resources (not just governmental resources, but also societyâ€™s) and have implications for efficiency and equity. Sometimes, these issues involve difficult trade-offs between efficiency and equity. How are we to decide? Should efficiency consideration always trump equity ones? The course is designed to familiarize students with the methods, strengths and limitations of economic reasoning in addressing these issues. Concepts covered in this course are drawn from both micro- and macroeconomics. Illustrations are conducted in an interactive manner using cases studies as well as widely cited examples in public management.",
