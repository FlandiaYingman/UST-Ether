        "description": "This course introduces students to basic theories and findings in environmental and health economics. The emphasis is on how the economic models and concepts can be used to analyze environmental and health issues. The course begins with an introduction of theoretical economic concepts and models; then it moves on to several policy-relevant environmental and health topics. Particular issues include externality, common goods and public goods, valuation of environmental goods and health, market failure and health, environmental regulations, pollution and health, and the economics of climate change.",

The post-midterm topics are advanced economic concepts applied to the scenarios of the environment and healthcare markets. These include estimation of the &quot;value&quot; of the environment and human lives, policy decision making, risk aversion in the insurance market, etc.<br /><br />These topics will stimulate you to re-think about the counter-intuitive part of economics and public policy decisions, and looking into its controversial aspects. The professor also digs into a few pieces of academic research and try to look at issues from an economic perspective, such as how to know whether the local government officials in China have faked the environment data or not, or how to quantify the effect of a certain policy on the environment.<br /><br />Unlike what is said at the beginning of the course, no calculus is involved. Prior knowledge in microeconomics is crucial though. The content is really rich and will become progressively more difficult after the midterm. Make sure you only enroll in this course after you've a basic understanding of microeconomics.",

The connection between the issues and economics is often not that trivial and requires a lil bit of thinking.<br /><br />The 4 problem sets are of reasonable difficulty and should not cost you much time. The exam style is usually straightforward and you will do decently well as soon as you really grasp the concepts.<br /><br />Prof He would give you some reading materials but these are only for supplementary purposes and are not absolutely required.",

            "comment_teaching": "First of all, most of the students do not listen to the lecture. There are a few reasons why: <br /><br />1) The professor's voice is extremely boring... The content is okay. <br />2) The seat in the lecture hall is too comfortable. I don't think the lecture hall was designed for academic purposes.",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm average was very low. Around 69. He adjusted the scores but students were not very happy about not having enough time to finish the exams. Plus, the exam had an entirely new, application problem that most of the students couldn't solve. So the midterm scores determined the term score because the final exam was not very hard. <br /><br />Midterm: 91 (adjusted score: 95) /100<br />Final: 27.3/30 (91/100) <br /><br />But most of all, the grades for assignments are not very high. It is difficult to get a 100 on the assignments. <br /><br />Assignment 1: 4.4/5.0<br />Assignment 2: 4.63/5.0<br />Assignment 3: 4.5/5.0<br />Assignment 4: 4.7/5.0 <br /><br />I talked to the TA about the grading but it seems that he does relative grading. He compares the answers with other students so the best few gets 20, the next few gets 19 ... and so on. <br /><br />News Article Review/Film Review: 18/20 (High: 19/20)",
            "comment_workload": "I'd say light workload.<br /><br />The assignments take quite a long time (3~5 hours maybe?) but there are only 4. The film review takes a little longer than that. But you should invest more time on the film review, which is worth 20% of your grade. <br /><br />If not for the stress of the exams, I'd say I enjoyed the course very much. <br /><br />And seek help from the TA, the TA has lot to offer. He may even give answers for the assignment questions (mainly because he also does not know what the professor is expecting for the questions. There are many open questions that's why)",
