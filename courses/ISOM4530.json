            "comment_content": "如標題所形容，ISOM4530係一個好精華既elective course，所教既係入門級 (financial) Data anaysis，同時著重statistics既theory，亦都著重實戰既應用 (係R platform之上)。<br /><br />四大Topics:<br />1. Univariate data analysis<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- probability density<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Quantile-Quantile plot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Histogram &amp; Kernel Density Estimation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Generalized Pareto Distribution for tail fitting<br />2. Multivariate data analysis<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Joint distributions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Bivariate Normal distribution<br />3. Regression<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Simple/ Multiple<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Linear/ Non-linear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Residual diagnostics<br />4. Time series<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Linear: Moving Average, Auto-Regressive, ARMA, ARIMA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Non-Linear: Mixed normal, ARCH, GARCH<br /><br />一開始以為個course係教我杜點樣用R，其實prof將重點放左係Statistical analysis度，即是說，就算你玩R好勁，如果唔識stat一樣冇用。所以呢個course有好大部分都係教緊你mathematical既stat，係真係用equation寫出黎既數學，係quantitative; 你會學到每種model背後既運作原理，知到佢地既assumptions, advantage, disadvantage，當你明白晒呢一切之後，prof先會教你實際既model fitting，即係用R。<br /><br />個人非常欣賞呢個course既setting。因為:<br />1. 滿足到數學上既渴求<br />Pre-requisite只要ISOM2500就得，即係所有business人都有得讀。而值得注意既係，個course內容係mathematically oriented，當中有唔少concept的確係深/ 未見過的，所以ISOM4530 offer到既係俾你以最少既數學資歷去體驗一次各大model既beauty，而前提係你會handle到的，只要聽足書。<br />2. 實用<br />Data analysis係商業世界既重要程度不在話下，R更加係其中一種最受歡迎既statistical programming language (Qfin個個都要學)，你係CV上話自己識R，已經會同其他人好唔同。而佢教既model，好多都係今時今日出面d人真係用緊既model，regression唔洗講啦，比較有價值既係heavy tails fitting (用GPD)、financial time series fitting (用ARCH/ GARCH)",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Zheng係一個好熱心教學既老師，講書係有一種激情。<br />只要你真係想黎學野，佢唔會令你失望。<br />可能小班教學關係，佢一定會認得你個樣，會知道你跟唔跟得上。<br />佢好樂意去解答學生問題，同時佢不時會提出一d有趣既問題考我地，一步一步引導我地去發掘平時留意唔到既野。",

            "comment_workload": "Workload其實算少，平日要做既就係得5份功課。但要注意既係，每份功課都要花你好多時間做的，得兩三條問題，但係花你一日都未必夠做，尤其係要用R做fitting既問題，你可能要對住部電腦幾個鐘狂試唔同input/ coding先會做到你想要既結果。但係呢個係必須要既部分，最好全程自己做，咁你先會學到野，同埋其實幫左你溫書。<br /><br />至於midterm同final呢，只要你平時上足堂、聽足書、抄足notes、有唔明即刻問，咁考之前已經會輕鬆好多，因為要明白既野你都明左，淨低只係睇多一次ppt同溫多次功課就可以。而且兩次考試都俾帶cheat sheet，所以根本唔洗特登背乜野。",

Please do ponder carefully whether you have enough ability to study this course.<br />If you think the compulsory math course and ISOM2500 is easy peasy for you, then yes, you might actually get a good grade in here. Otherwise, please look for other courses as om elective coz it's a bloodbath here.<br />Indeed, as other's have mentioned, calculation is not quite needed, but it doesn't make any difference as it requires you to understand all the logic behind. It is impossible for you to get through this course, even if you luckily manage to copy homework answer from coursehero you're gonna be finished like a cake in midterm and final project<br />The beginning part is handlable if you have some M1 dse background knowledge, like normal distribution n stuff. The second part, time series, which is the main part for you to do your project, it's quite hard to understand (even if I consider myself as having an above-average math ability).",

            "comment_workload": "homework usually takes more than hours to finish but it does help you to clarify some concepts<br />at the same time you have to do quite a lot of revision before you have the background knowledge to finish the homework (unless you are really good at math i.e. qfin student)<br />midterm is not really that hard (if you work your ass off to study)<br />the final project was suffering, there are two projects, each requires a 10-page report, you have to predict stock price for one project and another one is anything (you can set the topic yourself). Most importantly, the project is released a week prior to the final period and prof required us to submit it DURING the finals and you also have to finish HW7 at that time too",
