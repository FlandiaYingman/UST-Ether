            "comment_content": "See description.<br /><br />You want introduction to Lie Groups, you get introduction to Lie Groups. <br />The content is relatively simple compared to how complex the whole topic is. The in-depth content is given in the textbook (+ a few books given during the lessons), which one can look into if they so desire.<br /><br />The course is split into 3 parts, as a step-by-step journey (aka: &quot;introduction&quot;) to eventually understanding the topic:<br />1. Representation of Finite Groups<br />2. Lie Algebra (+ Representations)<br />3. Lie Groups (+ Representations)<br /><br />Oh, and the course assumes you know MATH3121/MATH3131 already, despite not having it as prerequisite. I didn't take that course, so I struggled quite a bit.",
            "comment_teaching": "Is average. The professor occasionally spends a bit of time explaining the background and application of Lie theory (it is an introduction after all), and will ask students to raise questions and comments about the materials taught. <br />I probably can't say for everyone because of my lack of math background, but I it took me a lot of off-class self-studying to catch up with the things taught.<br /><br />I'm just *very* glad that the Zoom recordings exist.",
            "comment_grading": "I got A+, despite failing to understand how the last question of the last homework worked. <br /><br />Since I don't know what grades other students received, and there are no feedback for the homework whatsoever, I can only assume with a sample size of 1 that the grading is very lax.",
            "comment_workload": "3 Homework only (questions given during lessons, to be submitted in a week after the chapter ends). No exams.<br /><br />The homework questions are given as a way for students to &quot;explore&quot; on the topic, and to understand how some of the idea and proofs work. (As the professor said they are kind of like &quot;mini-projects&quot;)<br />If you have enough understanding of how things work (or have watched the lecture enough times to understand the topic and questions), the questions aren't a big problem. I don't, so the homework took me some time. Not that much more than your average math proof-writing course though I guess.",
