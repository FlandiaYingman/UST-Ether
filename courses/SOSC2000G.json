        "description": "This course will examine elites in historical and contemporary societies. We will begin with military/political and clerical/educational elites in the past in what Thomas Piketty has referred to as ternary societies. We will then consider the propertied elites who emerged as a distinct category in recent centuries in many societies. General topics include how elites are defined and legitimated, how they maintain their power and position, and the survival, evolution or replacement of elites during times of disruption. Particular attention will be given to interactions between propertied elites and social, political, and economic institutions in the contemporary era, and the actual or potential role of institutions in empowering or constraining elites. The class will emphasize a comparative perspective, with particular emphasis on East and West from the 19th century to the present.",
