        "description": "This course will introduce you to Blue Ocean Strategy, one of the most original  ways of developing innovative strategy to appear in business thinking in recent years. This approach to strategy innovation distinguishes between the conventional cutthroat way most companies compete based on price and product features, known as the red ocean, and a new way of competing that emphasizes finding new markets that are free of competition â€“ blue oceans. The course will equip you with a set of highly practical tools that can be used in any organization both to develop strategic innovation and then to implement this change successfully.",
