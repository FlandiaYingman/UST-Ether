            "comment_content": "The content is very interesting and informative and as a required course for the OM major, the content taught is very applicable and useful for other OM courses. <br /><br />Some of the key topics in this course include total quality management, statistical process control, service quality, reliability, process capability, and acceptance sampling.<br /><br />There are also three cases covered during the semester, as well as two simulation games.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Cheung is really nice, friendly and helpful during class. Although the class was at 9 AM this semester and not many people showed up (the lecture videos are posted on Canvas), Professor Cheung was still really enthusiastic and clear in his teaching. <br /><br />The tutorials are also very helpful and are conducted by the TA. In the tutorials, you get a chance to practice some of the mathematical theories learnt in class and the TA covers everything at an appropriate pace for the students.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is pretty decent.<br /><br />The components that make up the final grade include:<br />— Midterm (60 points)<br />— Project (40 points)<br />— Final Exam (100 points)<br /><br />Both the midterm and the final are open-book, open-notes.<br /><br />The mean for the midterm this semester was quite low, and it was 36/60 with an SD of 8 or so. <br /><br />The mean for the final exam was 74/100 or so, again with an SD of 7 or so.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is pretty good, there are no homework assignments or anything of that sort. Tutorials are optional as well, and the materials are posted on Canvas afterwards. Students can pick their own group for the project, and even the project isn't too much work - one report and one presentation.",
