And because the students were obviously not listening, the teacher was a little upset about this. There have been cases where quizzes have been used as an excuse for students to come to class.",

Although it's an open-book test,&nbsp;&nbsp;you won't have enough time to search for the answer unless you are familiar enough for the contents.",
