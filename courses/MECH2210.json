            "comment_content": "The course contents can be broadly categorized into 3 groups of chapters:<br /><br />Group A:<br />1. Basic Properties of Fluid (including introduction on viscosity)<br />2. Fluid Statics<br />3. Bernoulli Equation<br />Group B*:<br />4. Kinematics of Fluid Motion (including Reynolds Transport Theorem)<br />5. Flow Analysis Using Control Volume<br />-----Midterm quiz/exam-----<br />Group B (con't):<br />6. Flow Analysis Using Differential Methods<br />Group C:<br />8. Pipe Flow<br />9. Forces on Submerged Bodies<br /><br />As indicated from the prerequisites, multivariable and vector calculus is an integral part of MECH2210. This is especially true when it comes to the Group B chapters, in which the derivation of theorems include tons of them. That said, as the homework and exam questions are generally easy, you won't see those kind of nightmare questions involving very complex functions similar to your MATH2011 finals.<br /><br />Professor Li said that the course's difficulty was similar to a bell curve: the Group B chapters are of the most difficult ones, while the Group A and C ones are relatively simple. In fact, as the course contents taught in Group B chapters are so overpowered/difficult, their applications are relatively simple. Lot's of cancellations are often required to reduce theorems into simpler forms in assignment and exam questions.",
            "comment_teaching": "Despite his heavy Chinese accent, Professor Li did teach well during lectures. Most of his lessons involved doing mathematical proofs about various theorems. While some students may find such teaching method boring, personally I find understanding and digesting mathematical proofs rather mentally stimulating (perhaps accustomed by Professor Rhea Liem's teaching during MECH1907).<br /><br />One of the pros of Professor Li is that he included relevant videos on his lectures, which made abstract concepts more understandable to us. While normally these are to be done by TAs in fact-to-face lectures, videos do provide us a good alternative during special periods. Professional experiences were also mentioned in lectures, such as how his colleagues tried to apply a 2D theorem on a 3D fluid flow.<br /><br />Regarding the TAs, Wang Yixiang is competent and helpful. Concepts and problem-solving skills are explained well on his tutorials. Despite occasional delays, he provided comprehensive and graphical replies to my homework questions sent by email. Liu Biyuan, the other TA, also offered satisfactory tutorials, although one time when I asked about homework questions, she just threw me with the suggested solutions.",
            "comment_grading": "Assignments: 10% (Given to everyone)<br />Midterm: 35% (85/100, Mean 71.46/100, Median: 75/100, SD: 22.86)<br />Final: 45% (Never released, but markings by TA can be seen before the course page was deleted)<br /><br />The assignments are submitted on a voluntary basis, and at the end everyone gets the 10% marks. That said, you receive rather detailed feedbacks from the TA (mainly done by Wang Yixiang), which definitely helps with your learning and better prepares you for exam (at least you don't need to cram all questions before the last lectures).<br /><br />Instead of exams, Professor Li called them &quot;quizzes&quot; and conducted them in class (basically exam in another name). For the midterm, 2 of the questions are copied homework questions, with one of them copied without numerical value change.<br /><br />The final is of another format though. There are 2 conceptual questions, with one of them directly asking contents mentioned on lectures. Apart from these concept questions, all other exam questions are rather simple, and are of the difficulty of assignment questions.<br /><br />Professor Li personally said that if you can finish assignment questions, you should get a satisfactory score in quizzes (exam).<br /><br />At the end I get an A+ for MECH2210. Note that Professor Redonnet in the other lecture session has different grading. If you desire a good grade, you should seriously consider enrolling in Professor Li's class.",
            "comment_workload": "All assignments were given at the beginning of the course, which if starting from the end of a chapter, will have approximately one week for us to complete. The assignments are generally of the difficulty of our limited lecture examples, and generally, nothing more difficult will appear on exams.<br /><br />Tutorials were given on a weekly basis, in which assignment solutions are released and explained in class. The TAs also prepared sufficient examples for us to try on, which compensated the relative lack of examples during lectures.",

Same technique is also applied to final exam, which has easier questions compared to hw problems (very advanced calculation problems). I made some interesting assumptions in the final exam, solved all three problems rather easily but screwed up half of assignments.. ended with an A.

For me, the hardest thing is to distinguish different equations clearly. Dun mix things together or else it would be hell. And some equations require specific conditions to use, like inviscid, incompressible, irrotational and so on. If you can't identify them clearly, you even can't start any question and you will stuck as mine, staring at the question and doing nothing.",

For me, I blinded the first question and even dun know did i make appropriate assumption for doing q2 and q3. It is just a make or break gamble.",
