        "description": "HKUST is a dynamic university, constantly changing, and filled with opportunities to reshape the way it operates into a more sustainable-driven institution. This course focuses on how change happens at HKUST, how to manage those changes, and how to ensure that changes can be done through the application of a set of sustainability principles and guidelines. Using practical theories and management tools, students will explore how sustainability can provide a powerful framework for solving problems and developing new management strategies. Students will then take those new tools and apply them in real-life projects on the HKUST campus that have the potential to create meaningful and lasting changes. Students will experience first-hand the power of sustainable thinking and how these concepts can be applied across all disciplines. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
