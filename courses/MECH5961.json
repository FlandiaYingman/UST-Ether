        "description": "The aims of this module are to acquaint students with the knowledge of acoustics and aerodynamically generated sound, its generation either through turbulent flow or unsteady aerodynamic force‐surface interaction, and numerical methods for accurate numerical prediction of aerodynamically generated noise as well as its propagation and far‐field characteristics. The wide applications of the subject are noise, environmental impact of noise and transport related noise.",
