        "description": "This course is a special edition of a course designed to 1) mediate the divide between the Arts and the Sciences; 2) introduce students new to anthropology aspects of culture theory and contemporary ecological/environmental anthropology; 3) forge a synthesis between culture theory and historical ecology; and 4) provide new insights on how human both fashion and are fashioned by their environments. Although case studies will be drawn from throughout the world, there will be a stress on the social systems and environments from the Asias (S., SE., & E.) to Australia, with the Americas and Western Europe added for comparative purposes. Three dominant themes will be the relationships between climate and human culture (through time), time systems as organizing devices, and the centralizing role of communication systems in the structuring of social life.",
