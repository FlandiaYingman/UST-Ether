            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Dik Lee was a good guy, but his tone was really boring. <br /><br />The notes could be better designed, like the name of topic. Some information was outdated.<br /><br />Labs were really, really bad. Lab materials were not explanatory enough. The ability of TAs was obviously not acceptable.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is good for some people, but also bad for many people. Let's review on the grading scheme first:<br /><br />Homework 1 - 8%<br />Homework 2 - 14%<br />Homework 3 - 10%<br />Take-home Midterm (3 hours) - 10%<br />Project Phase 1 - 5%<br />Project Phase 2 - 25%<br />Take-home Final (3 hours) - 24%<br />Lecture Attendance - 1%<br />Lab Attendance - 1%<br /><br />As we had lessons online, the grading scheme had been tuned, especially for the exams. You can see the weighting of both exam did not contribute much to the final grade - that's a problem. Many people could get similar scores in this semester, so if there was a slight mark difference between people, the grades between them could be greatly different. For example, if 87/100 (final score) get a B+, 85/100 will receive a B-. Two sub-grades! It's real!<br /><br />I actually got above mean for most of the things but below mean in the final, finally received a B-. Some people might think it's good grade, but I don't think so (at least for this semester).",
            "comment_workload": "The workload was heavy.<br /><br />3 Assignments, 2 of them involved programming work.<br /><br />Project required us to make a search engine on CSE webpages. It consumed a lot of time and effort. The labs would teach a bit skills for the project, but not that helpful. Some important skills (especially those for handling RocksDB) were not taught at all.<br /><br />The final exam asked a lot of questions that are not covered in the assignments. The examples in the lecture notes were not explanatory, so basically it's difficult to follow the notes to finish the exam.",

I would say I wrote like 90% of the code. They helped with documentations stuff that I didn't want to write so I am ok with that. Note, you will need to actually design the way data is stored, so pay attention to those in lectures.<br /><br />Because I had pretty solid understanding of what to do, and I have pretty good experience with Java, I didn't find the process too stressful. The sad thing was that their instruction was not clear about how many pages to scrap, I would recommend scraping as much as you can so that when you demo, the correct page will show up in the search result.

            "comment_workload": "Two homework, just some short questions which are not difficult. Almost everyone gets 9x~100.<br /><br />The midterm and final exam is open-notes so it is not difficult.<br /><br />The workload of this course mostly comes from the project. The project required your group to implement a search engine using whatever programming language you want( java is suggested ). It takes some time to do this. There are many details you can implement, this is not required but you can get bonus.<br /><br />Overall, this course is not difficult and won't take you many time.",
