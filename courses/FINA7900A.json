        "description": "The course will emphasize theoretical frameworks that underlie some of the important ideas in modern corporate finance.  Topics covered will be (i) Financial Contracting, (ii) Capital Structure and Corporate Strategy , (iii) Agency Problems, Investment Distortions, and Discipline, (iv) Information Asymmetry and Financing,(v) Corporate Governance. The theory will be motivated by and connected to empirical facts, although we will not go into details of empirical papers on the topics. An important goal is to help students learn how to write down a basic model to capture an idea.",
