And make sure there is one guy who will unify the format and the citation styles before the submission.<br /><br />For Individual assignments, the main objectives for the assignment are to let you to show your knowledge and skills learned in this class, which means you will need to cover everything taught in this course, you will make some tables and write a lot to describe and explain the trend of those data. From my experiences, you will need around 6000 words to explain everything from data to explanation, from past to present, and anticipate the future data as long as the justification of them, and comment on the data quality.<br /><br />As this semester was delivered in online mode, all lectures were having In zoom meetings. <br /><br />On regular basis, you will only need to attend 3 lectures per two weeks, as the class size is too huge, you will be allocated into group A or B and come in only the group working day and join the debriefing session. The group working day is basically everyone AFK in zoom and finish the assignments, while the briefing day is just briefing on your assignments, which is usually not longer than 30mins and you can watch the lecture videos and finish the quiz in the rest of the time. So the only workload of this course is the individual assignments, make sure don't deadline fight them(which i did) and take some time to grind out a quality essay.",
