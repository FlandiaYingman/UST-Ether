The notations used in lecture slides are different from the notation used in the software R, which makes the student hard to understand the materials. There are not many real life application but the material in the lecture can get you prepared for the interview questions especially for the quantitative role in the financial industry.",
            "comment_teaching": "It was hard for the students to follow the instructor as the instructor was not well prepared before the lecture.

The professor just talks random proofs for 13 weeks and doesn't even introduce the topics, or relate it to real world applications at any point. Don't know anything about time series after finishing this course, just got slightly better at proofs..",
