        "name": "Introduction to Data Analytics for Smart Transportation Systems",
        "description": "This course covers the role of stochasticity in transport systems and the methods used to account for this within transport infrastructure assessment, with a particular focus on the application of data analysis methods. The course introduces how to analyse the performance of public transport systems, road network, and emerging mobility services using classic queuing theory, travel time reliability concepts and travel demand models as well as machine learning techniques. The course will complement skills learnt in the other transport courses to provide a well-rounded knowledge of smart transport planning and management. The focus is on the application of transport models in real world settings using real data. Students have the opportunity to work with large open source data in two experiential-learning projects. The course also develops skills for working with data and managing collaborative projects.",
