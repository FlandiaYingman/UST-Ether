            "comment_teaching": "His teaching pace in this course is very slow; he focuses too much in calculation, while I think we can handle the calculations pretty well once we grasp the concepts for the topics. Another possible reason for the slow teaching pace is due to the fact that this is a new course taught by him, and he rushed when writing lecture notes for us, resulting to numerous errors in the lecture notes. Sometimes, he even double checks the calculations during lectures, which I think wastes quite a big chunk of time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are some benefits by having this slow teaching pace. For example, we have less topics to study for final exam. Since this is a course heavily demanded on calculations and final results, we would have more time doing those stuffs before exams.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems that he lacks preparation when teaching this course in general. In the future, these issues may not happen again as he already knows what matters the most then.",

As usual, absolute grading is adopted in this course. However, since everything went online for this term, all the assessment components are made harder than usual. Moreover, the cutoffs are higher than usual too. In particular (subject to change):<br />A+ : 95 or above<br />A range: 85 or above<br />B range: 65 or above<br />P range: 40 or above AND &gt;=25 in final exam<br />2.

It is important for you to understand the relationship between formulas and understand what insurance and annuity mean in the timeline. If you have a graphical intuition, you will do well.",
