        "name": "Managing CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)",
        "description": "This course will focus on specific CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) issues facing companies today. Along with changing attitudes, new global regulatory CSR requirements are increasingly putting firms under pressure to demonstrate positive social and environmental impacts, while maintaining their commitments to investors. Students will investigate how actual firms are managing these pressures while continuing to address the needs of their stakeholders. Incorporating aspects of the benchmark standards such as the GRI and various ESG (Environmental Social Governance) initiatives will help students to strengthen their own knowledge, skill, and attitudes in this area. The course has an embedded project, with direct links to one or more businesses, which will give students the necessary practical grounding for effectively understanding the challenges of CSR in the contemporary business environment.",

She loves engaging her students and since it's a small class, be prepared to participate in class discussions and Canvas discussions. She speaks monotonously sometimes but it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />She also makes sure everyone gets a chance to speak. Also, she's open with students so you'll be treated as an adult. She really appreciates people who contribute meaningfully in class.",

For news media sharing, you just have to find 1 article and manage the Canvas discussion. In online discussion, you have to post 2 short comments/week on other people's news articles. Case study analysis is a 4-page paper. The deadlines are quite flexible because: for news sharing, the TA assigns different weeks to everyone, and there are 4 opportunities to submit the case analysis during the semester.<br /><br />Midterm is okay and GRI standards quiz is very easy to score full marks in. You just need to work hard for the group project, and you know your company from the first lecture.",
