It is useful, but far less than what is needed to understand the complex Chinese business environment. I would suggest read more on your own if possible. Professors will share his insights in class, so attendance is important if you are eager to learn. Overall it's a typical gbus course with a little twist towards Chinese business, but not significant, you can have a basic understanding.",

The year I attend, we are with students from WBB program. I think they are not up to speed yet, so we spent quite some time to bring them up to speed, which is sometimes a efficiency drag.",

I can put the course description below but it is misleading, teaches things that seem to be applicable in real life but in fact not quite.<br /><br />This course explores the way key business and managerial practices play out in an Asian and emerging markets context, with a particular emphasis on China. It provides a big picture overview of the business framework in these markets along with a focus on both challenges and opportunities. To be a successful business leader, students must possess not only technical skills and knowledge but be able to deal with regional and international business issues independently. In studying key business, political, economic, social, financial and cultural characteristics of some Asian countries, students will recognize regional differences and be able to realize opportunities by adopting relevant business strategies. Through experiential exercises, case studies, and presentations, students are expected to apply their business knowledge to tackle doing business in different parts of Asia and emerging markets with a critical eye and a cross- disciplinary approach. Guest speakers will be arranged to provide an opportunity for students to learn from business leadersâ€™ professional experience and obtain first-hand information in the market.",
            "comment_teaching": "Veronique deserves an F, teaching about what is finance in the second half which is bullshit, pretending to be interactive but in fact no one cares. Cassian is not too bad to be fair, he is actually good and sometimes i am convinced by what he says, he deserves a B, therefore I am giving an average of D for this.",
            "comment_grading": "Intransparency at its best. Nobody knows how things are graded, you can get an A out of nowhere while doing fuck all, and you can also get a B out of nowhere while actually doing things. Just simply do not take this course, or pray to God on a daily basis for a good grade when taking this course. I can put the grading here for reference but DO NOT TRUST IT<br /><br />One-page write-up: 40% (10% each)<br />Presentation: 20% (10% each)<br />Attendance: 10%<br />Contribution: 10%<br />Final Presentation: 20%<br /><br />One-page write-up: 34.3/40<br />One of the presentations: 8.1/10<br />Otherwise I have zero idea how i did for the others<br /><br />Final grade: A-<br />I don't even know if I should be happy or sad about this grade, given how intransparent the grading is",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is not too bad given it is a GBUS course. 4 one-page write-ups, and 3 presentations in total. All of them you have technically one week to prepare for them. Just pray for decent enough groupmates and you are good to go. Dumbest thing is you need to answer questions in lessons just like any other GBUS course, life hack is to type in canvas discussions instead, for an introverted person like me, that is how I gained participation. Presentations are done in super ceebs manner, perhaps everyone thinks this course is trash. Just don't take it.",
