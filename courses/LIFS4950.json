Definitely not recommend this course, there are better electives to choose. <br /><br />He is willing to discuss with students though. Responsive to questions during classes.",

He even didn't tell us how many questions he had until the beginning of the exam. Although it is open book, really have no time to look it up. You had better treat it as a close book exam and try to memorize as much as you can. (actually, the midterm is similar, just treat it as a close book exam) <br /><br />- my grade: 10/10 for two essays, 38/40 for mt(high 40, mean 32.2, low 17), project and final unknown, A eventually.",
