        "description": "Learning in nervus systems relies on modifying synapses between neurons which needs to be implemented by cellular mechanisms obeys various biological constraints. This results in different learning algorithms from those in artificial neural networks. The course aims to review classical theoretical methods and results that characterize the such biological learning algorithms in simplified models of neural circuits. Students should seek approval from the course instructor to take this course.",
