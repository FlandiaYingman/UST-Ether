            "comment_content": "This course is a PG course mainly on 2-D and 3-D linear elasticity theory. As students in this course come from different backgrounds, the course starts from Part 0, which is on advanced stress analysis for UG students (already cut from the UG curriculum). This is different from the Mechanics of Materials class as this course mainly focuses on derivations instead of calculations. This course originally has 3 parts, but due to the limited time, the remaining time is used to cover Part 1 of the course.<br /><br />Contents of Part 0:<br />1. Introduction<br />2. Theory of Plane Problems (2-D)<br />3. Solution of Plane Problems in Rectangular Coordinates<br />4. Solution of Plane Problems in Polar Coordinates<br />5. Torsion<br />6. Plane Problems on Thermal Stress<br />7. Theory of Spatial Problems (3-D)<br /><br />Contents of Part 1: <br />1. Introduction<br />2. Vectors and Tensors<br />3. Stress and stress analysis<br />4. Analysis of deformation<br />5. Constitutive equations<br /> <br />I think the course content is quite heavy as it involves a lot of mathematical derivations. The prof always asks us to read the textbook ourselves to understand the details, and he only points out the results. So it takes me a lot of time to derive the results myself, as I don't have the textbook.<br /><br />But the content is suitable for mechanical engineering students who will do research on mechanics and materials.",
            "comment_teaching": "QP Sun's teaching in this course is quite different from that for MECH 2040. He assumes everyone has the textbook and read it before attending his lecture, so his lecture did not focus on the lengthy derivations. Instead, he points out some additional questions out of his notes for us to think, which will (usually) then appear in the quizzes. But besides that, his lecture does not add more value to the course as he just read the things in his notes.",
            "comment_grading": "8 quizzes, no midterm, no final, all quizzes equal weight<br /><br />I only know the grades for the first 3 quizzes as the TA will group the quizzes for grading. After quiz 5, due to the class suspension, the remaining quizzes become take home exam and we are also required to self study the remaining chapters and write a summary report on our learning progress. The summary report does not count any marks.<br /><br />For the quizzes, remember to attend lectures to know what prof emphasizes much. Usually they appear in the quizzes.<br /><br />As the quizzes are open-book and open-computer, you can just work out the proofs before the quizzes and copy it to your answer book. The time for the quizzes is not quite enough, so it is wise to just copy your stuff to the answer book instead of thinking about how to proceed. (Yes, you don'e even have time to think in one of the quizzes.)<br /><br />Quiz 1: 8/10<br />Quiz 2 and Quiz 3: 10/10 <br />Others: unknown<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />I don't know other's results, so I can't judge on the mean grading. Heard from my classmate, the grading of this course should be harsher than other PG courses, but still better than UG courses.",
            "comment_workload": "Depends on how much you want to get from this course. If you just want to get good grades, grab the textbook, copying their proofs to the quizzes and you are done. But if you want to get something out of this course, do every derivation for the results in the notes without referring to the textbook. But it consumes a lot of time, and you may not have time to do your research. So manage your time wisely, and be clear about your goals.<br /><br />Attending lecture may be another workload since I have every 3-hour lecture starting from 6:30 pm!",
