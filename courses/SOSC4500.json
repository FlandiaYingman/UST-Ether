        "description": "This course introduces to senior undergraduate and first year graduate students in the Division of Social Science major topics in the study of the state in political science and sociology. It covers normative studies of the legitimacy and autonomy of the state, comparative historical analysis on state formation, empirical studies of state capacity, and nationalism. It incorporates both classical scholarship in the study of the state and recent progress in quantitative and qualitative research of the state. Readings are selected from political philosophy, historical sociology, political science and economic history. This course is designed to help the students to integrate quantitative and qualitative methodology in studying topics that are related to the state of their own interests. The course aims to help the students generate research ideas that are related to various aspects of the state in either contemporary or historical context, either China-focused or examining China in comparative perspective.",
