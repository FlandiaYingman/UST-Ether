Experiments covered in this course will be closely connected with the topics covered in the lecture courses, including Beer's law, calibration principle, and some basic simple instrumental techniques such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry, Gas Chromatography, etc. For students in the programs under the four-year degree that designate this course as required course/specified elective.",

All answers are in there.<br /><br />Oral exam is basically TAs asking ONE question (calculation, concept, definition, etc), and given 3 minutes to answer it on a paper or on ZOOM board thing. Don't have to show working, only the answer is graded. Marked out of 20.<br /><br />Five e-Reports - 60%<br />Lab Quiz - 20%<br />Oral Exam - 20%<br /><br />I got very good scores for Quizzes.<br />Slipped badly and got 2/20 for Oral Exam.<br />Good scores for Report<br />B at the end.",

The marking is done by a computer program, so any slight offsets in data input will be marked wrong. TAs or profs will not go through them.<br /><br />Given that we are all given same pre-processed data, as long as you do the calculations properly, you will get perfect scores.<br /><br />You're gonna spend at least 3 hours per experiment.",
