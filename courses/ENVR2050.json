        "description": "We start with one simple question: is there something special or unique about a sustainability mindset that provides us better insights and tools for solving long-term or systemic problems? In this hands-on class we first start by challenging the traditional methods for making decisions, recognizing some typical thinking “blunders” that result in non-sustainable outcomes. We then explore several conceptual tools and skills that can help us overcome these mistakes like systems thinking, future thinking, strategic thinking, values thinking, and complex problem solving. We then test out these mental tools by working together to develop a range of potential solutions to some of Hong Kong’s most difficult sustainability challenges. This is a flipped classroom – using online learning modules in place of lectures – with class time dedicated to theme based discussions and group exercises.",

            "comment_content": "I signed up for this course just to max out my credits, but I finished this course with a newfound interest in sustainability.<br /><br />There are a total of 10 weekly readings that can go up to 20 pages in length. The readings help provide students with a background on each topic that will be discussed, and I heavily suggest going through each reading from start to finish.<br /><br />The topics of the readings include:<br />Sustainability Thinking Blunders<br />Mental Models<br />Systems Thinking<br />Norms, social pressure and behaviour change<br />Role of identities and understanding stakeholders<br />Values Thinking<br />Future Thinking<br />Decarbonisation Thinking<br />Communication and Framing<br />and Complex Problem Solving and Critical Thinking<br /><br />Aside from the readings, professor Davis deepens the understanding of the topic through online modules through Canvas.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Davis is the most friendly and approachable professor I have ever met in UST so far, and I took his class as a year 1 UG student. <br /><br />On the first day, he went around asking everyone for their names and what they would like to be called, and although he probably needed it for the attendance grade, it was very comforting to me that there was at least one professor who cared to learn my name. <br /><br />With regards to his teaching of the course, I have no complaints. He is a well-spoken guy and he explains things in a way that is simple enough for me to understand without patronising me. He is patient and always willing to check up on the class and our progress in understanding the lessons. He provides more than enough materials to deepen your understanding about sustainability thinking, and links many external resources.",
            "comment_grading": "Grade Distribution:<br />30% -&gt; Reading Discussion Leader and Class Participation (ATTENDANCE IS CHECKED AND GOES TOWARDS THIS GRADE)<br />10% -&gt; Online Modules and Weekly Reflections (REMEMBER TO DO THE WEEKLY REFLECTIONS *BEFORE* THE CLASS OF THE SAID TOPIC)<br />40% -&gt; Two Group Projects (20% each)<br />20% -&gt; Final Paper<br /><br />It is important to note that professor allows students to do the weekly reading leader project MORE THAN ONCE if you WANT EXTRA CREDIT. I did it twice.<br /><br />When initially receiving my individual grades (not yet the final letter grade), I was scared that I would not be able to receive A-range, however, I received A on my final letter grade.<br /><br />Below are my grades and some displayed mean/high scores:<br />Class Participation: 8/10 (Mean=7.4, Highest=8.7)<br />Online Reflections: 7.5/10 (Mean=6.9, Highest=10)<br />Group Project 1: 17/20 (Mean=16.1, Highest=17)<br />Group Project 2: 18/20 (Mean=17.3, Highest=19)<br />Final Paper: 20/20 (Mean=15.7, Highest=20)",
            "comment_workload": "If you do not like a lot of coursework, this course is not for you. Fortunately *I* like this type of coursework so I was completely happy with it. I will say however, that because the readings are long (10+ pages each week, PLUS online modules and online reflection), it can sometimes get overbearing. I didn't live on campus for my first year, so I commuted from UST all the way to Tung Chung, and while doing that I read on the assigned reading. Even then, I didn't finish reading it before I got home/to school.",
