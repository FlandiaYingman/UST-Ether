She would show interesting videos about the topics and ask for our questions to address, sad that she is leaving :(<br /><br />Oh for Arh.Liu, he is also quite nice but sometimes he speaks too soft, and would make some catastrophic assumptions that we knew how to interpret his research findings with random graphs and equations come from nowhere.
