        "description": "This independent study course is an introduction of the theory of ordinary differential equations in the complex domain. We focus on the local behaviour of the solutions of Fuchsian equations as well as the global behaviour by means of the monodromy representations. Finally we will describe special solutions via monodromies as an application. Students should seek instructor's approval to take this course.",
