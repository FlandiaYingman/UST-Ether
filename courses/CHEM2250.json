        "description": "This course is the laboratory course designed for students who enrolled in CHEM 2210. Students will perform a series of inorganic experiments related to the theory learnt in courses. Students will be trained to perform a wide range of basic inorganic laboratory techniques, operate chemical instruments in laboratory, relate the physical and chemical principles and theory in practice and develop their data interpretation and analyzing skills. Experiments of the preparation of different metal complexes and organometallic compounds will be included. For CHEM students under the four-year degree only.",

Getting full marks for &quot;Attendance and risk assessment&quot; is a must. For lab quiz, it's hard to get full mark every time but at least I maintained my scores above mean. &quot;Performance&quot; mark is easy to get as long as you don't break glasswares. &quot;Product&quot; mark is also not difficult to get full mark compares to Organic Chemistry lab.
