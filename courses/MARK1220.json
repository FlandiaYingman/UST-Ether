The peer evaluation is also really important so make sure you're not free-riding or else your grade is going to take a hit.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is pretty light as long as you work on the group project progressively. The report is pretty easy because it's short, and you can be creative with the formatting and such. Coral doesn't give you any guidance on what the content should be so you have to work it out on your own with your group. Also, if you're an SBM student she has higher expectations for you. You can actually pick your team (a group of 5) so if you have friends taking the course with you that would be an advantage, because if not you're going to be assigned a team. The final exam (closed book) is basically just all of the content along with a bunch of MCQ questions and a short essay style question. If you just revise through the ppt slides + readings it's more than enough to revise for, but the short-answer question was a little more abstract because she doesn't say much about it until the end of the semester so try to ask for more examples to get a better understanding of how to do it.",

All of the topics are linked with the society that we are living it. Don't expect to learn marketing concepts or skillset from this course. Since this course is more about our daily shopping habits/behaviors, and how we make choices, how are choices are being effected by marketing. Overall, it is a &quot;blowing water&quot; course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Coral has a strong accent, which needs a week to get familiarize. She doesn't teach according to her powerpoints/schedule, therefore attending the class is important as the powerpoint doesn't cover most of the things she said in class (also for participation marks). The course schedule was changed at least 3 times throughout the semester (sometimes without prior notice!!!). She is also very emotional, her decision varies with her emotion. Be prepared for the everchanging schedule.<br /><br />The TA was nice and can answer our questions with cantonese/mandarin/english, but she seems not familiar with Canvas as I seldom receives announcement notifications, need to check myself on canvas regularly... ==",

It also covers how marketing can solve social problems. <br /><br />Generally, I think the content is quite interesting, topics such as fast-fashion and advertisements are closely related to our daily lives and we can realize how marketing plays a big role in it.",

If you participate 15 times or more in class, you get the full marks of it.<br /> <br />However, the grading isn't very transparent, I don't really know any of my marks so I can't tell whether my grade is reasonable or not.

We start by talking about how marketing has made this world a terrible place, and how we can use marketing to fix it. <br /><br />There is a huge emphasis on sustainability and social good. We cover topics like Marketing practices in Fashion, Meat, Politics, F&amp;B industries. There are some excellent professional guest speakers who come and give their perspective about the course content. <br /><br />This content influenced and inspired me to change the way I behave in my daily life, from decreasing my meat intake to vowing never to buy from fast fashion companies and actively practising recycling. <br /><br />There are also many real-world case studies which are up to date so, we can keep up based on whatever is happening around us. We also watch a lot of advertisements, ted talks and speeches during the class.",

And she always invites students to networking events where you could get internships. <br /><br />If you take this class, make sure to create a meaningful connection with her, it could be very beneficial to you.",

It is very exciting to work on. We are required to create some social awareness on an issue within HKUST that related to one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Feel free to discuss your ideas with the professor, and pick up on hints about what she is looking for. <br /><br />Peer Evaluation - 10%<br />Don't freeride, and report free riders. <br /><br />Final Quiz - 35%<br />The best way to 'study' for the quiz is to attend each class, pay attention and engage with the content.
