        "description": "Solar Cells are considered as one of the most promising renewable energy technologies. Conventional solar cells are based inorganic materials such as Si. In the past decade, however, several new solar cell technologies based organic materials are emerging as promising alternatives to conventional solar cells. In many of these advanced solar cell technologies, chemistry has been playing an important role. For example, in Polymer Solar Cells, it is critical to design and synthesize organic and polymer materials with unique photovoltaic and charge-transporting properties. This course will give an overview of several important solar cell technologies including Si cells, polymer solar cells, and dye-sensitized cells. The chemistry components of this course include how to design chemical structures to achieve photovoltaic and charge-transporting properties, and how to apply chemistry principles to understand the structures and properties of solar cell technologies. For science and engineering students only.",
