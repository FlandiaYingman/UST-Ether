        "name": "Quantitative Data Analysis for Social Research I",
        "description": "This course focuses on practical aspects and implementation of social data analysis by introducing basic yet hands-on techniques for presenting, analyzing, and interpreting quantitative data, many of which are rarely taught in a regular statistics course. It is deliberately designed as complementary to a formal and theoretically-oriented introductory statistics course. This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of the course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn to real-world data. Upon completion of the course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as a better understanding of quantitative social scientific research. Not to be taken by students admitted to BSc Quantitative Social Analysis from 2022-23 and onwards.",

            "comment_content": "The course has gone through major shifts in its contents because the course is being offered as a requirement for SHSS students. So the review before 2017-2018 Spring is no longer valid. <br /><br />The professor kept excusing himself that he's teaching 3 courses this term, but I don't care. The professor was undoubtedly unprepared and didn't seem confident about what he was offering to his students. <br /><br />I don't think the content is the problem for this course. It teaches basic stuff related to statistics in Social Science Research. Not too technical, but because the professor tries to avoid technical stuff, the course ends up going no where + repetitive. <br /><br />Stuff like: <br /><br />Sources of social data<br />Data Generating Processes<br />Variables<br />Data Manipuation<br />Describing Uni-variate Distribution<br />Two-way table<br />Compare distribution between Groups<br />Scatterplot, Correlation, OLS<br />Regression Analysis<br />Causality &amp; Study Design<br />Hierarchical Data Structure<br /><br />are taught.",
            "comment_teaching": "It's just ordinary teaching where he reads the presentation slides. And most of the explanation he provides for the questions are: &quot;That is too hard to understand. Not the scope of this course. You probably haven't heard of ... &quot;<br /><br />I sent many emails and talked to him lots of times regarding the lack of instructions for assignments and grading rubrics for the project. No matter how many times I tell him about the course, he is not willing to fix those mistakes and make the course student-friendly.",
            "comment_grading": "Final exam with a weight of 30~40% and 20 Multiple Choice Questions. That is probably enough to explain what the course is like. I discussed this with another professor and he seemed confused as well. <br /><br />The format of the exam destroys the meaning of the final exam which is to evaluate students' efforts throughout the term.",
            "comment_workload": "The only good thing about the course. Not much work load. Go to classes and hope you will do great on your final exam, do two assignments, and get into a good group for your project. <br /><br />If you are not a SHSS student, I am pretty sure there are more math-oriented statistics courses that will help you more.",

The instructor taught in a clear way, and it's certain that he'd made careful plans for his teaching and had stuck to it. He is also patient, and is always willing to answer questions. <br />However, as least from my perspective, the correlation between knowledge points was not empathised, which made summarisation and revision a little difficult, and the professor sometimes failed to identify the parts of the contents that are complicated and hard to understand (i.e., he spent quite some time on things that are easy). This made his classes tedious and the learning atmosphere quite inactive. <br />Another thing that adds to the difficulty in learning is that he didn't give answers to quizzes. It's sometimes disturbing. So try your best not to miss too much things in class.",
