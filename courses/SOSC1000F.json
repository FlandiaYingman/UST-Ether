        "name": "Globalization in Everyday Life",
        "description": "This course is designed for students who are interested to explore how their personal lives have been shaped by globalization. We will start by asking questions about some of the most relatable everyday experiences: How do we become so reliant on and addicted to Internet? Why are we faced with increasingly frequent disasters, like pandemic? And what structure our constantly changing tastes for pop culture? We will find answers to these questions through the lens of neoliberalism, a political economic ideology that has transformed the world since the 1980's, and with reference to some interesting and in-depth case studies.",

An accurate name for this course would be &quot;Capitalists are bad and globalization is their evil scheme REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot;<br /><br />After this course you become a bona fide, certified leftard who knows how to hate on anything on demand. No critical thinking required. <br /><br />Syllabus attached below. (and some slides but file size is bs)",

There are some words that leftists invented so you need to memorize them. Reading are useless and long (no one would read that 340 page &quot;Rare Earth Frontiers&quot;) so avoid them.<br /><br />Essay questions are easy. Just write fast and furiously. Muster your hate for greedy riches and unleash it at once.<br /><br />There is no assignment, just saying. Unless you want to get that extra 1 mark by taking photos of &quot;pink tax&quot;",

The MCQ was not that hard but I screwed up a bit :P. You will definitely get a good grade for the essay section if you studied the case studies Prof Chen gave you.<br />- My grade (MCQ): 42/60<br />- My grade (Essay): 39/40<br />- My total midterm grade: 81/100 (Mean 68.5)<br /><br />Finals (covers Module 3 and 4)<br />- She made the MCQs much easier than they were in the midterm (she said it was so that our grades could be higher lmao). The essay's difficulty was the same for the finals.<br />- My grade (MCQ): 51/60<br />- My grade (Essay): 40/40<br />- My final grade: 94/100 (+3 from extra credits) (Mean: 73/100) <br /><br />Term Paper (optional)<br />- If you want to choose the second way of grading in this course then you are required to write a term paper.<br /><br />My total grade: 90. <br />Letter Grade: A.",
