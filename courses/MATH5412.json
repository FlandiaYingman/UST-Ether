            "comment_content": "There are four parts in this course:<br /><br />1. Stable law, infinitely divisible distribution (Durrett chapter 3)<br /><br />2. functional limiting thm and weak convergence of<br />random function (Convergence of probability measure chapter 2, Billingsley)<br /><br />3. Martingale and its limiting thms (Durrett chapter 5)<br /><br />4. Concentration (High dimensional probability, Roman)<br /><br /><br />The content of this course is very hardcore, especially for the first two parts. They actually require some background in analysis and point set topology. <br /><br />The concepts in the Martingale parts are easy to understand but the real life applications and modeling are extremely complicated. <br /><br />The last part of the course is the Concentration inequality, which is quite interesting and useful (in data science?).",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Bao's teachings were good! <br /><br />Sometimes Prof. Jin was also in the lesson and he suggested that Prof. Bao's teachings were too smooth, students may not have enough time to digest the martial during the lessons. I totally agree with this. <br />Please feel free to ask questions during lessons.",
            "comment_grading": "I don't know how to do some parts of few questions in the exam and finally got an A-. <br />Grades are not that important in PG courses. More important is what you learnt from the courses.",
