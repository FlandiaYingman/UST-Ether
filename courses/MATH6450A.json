        "description": "The course is concerned with methodology, techniques and software to explore and analyze large complex data sets. By introducing principal ideas in statistical learning, the course will help students to understand conceptual underpinnings and statistical insights of a variety of supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods. Topics include: Linear methods for regression and classification, model assessment and selection, decision trees, additive models, bagging and boosting, neural networks and support vector machines, clustering, graphical models, multiple testing. Students should seek approval from the instructor to take this course.",

            "comment_teaching": "Will benefit students who have some hands-on experience in machine-learning. Preferably some coding experience such as R and Python. He will go over the topic depending on his own research interest but you can discuss with him if you have some topics really interested in. Rigourous math is hardly spotted but you can drill it with ESL (Although ISLR will be a better point to start with). Friendly to non-statistic major students.",
            "comment_grading": "Friednly grading. No requirement on attendence, though interesting lectures. depending on your project's overall performance. You can form a team up to 4 members, good to collaborate since there's no restriction on the dataset and topics you analyze. (Kaggle can be a good site to refer to).",
            "comment_workload": "Generally light, no assignments, only projects for final evaluation, but you need to submit a proposal when forming up a team, should be around wk 3 after the add-drop period. Some extremely competitive UG students will also enroll in this course.",
