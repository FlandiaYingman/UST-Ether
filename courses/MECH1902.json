It covers the fundamental aspects of energy systems and energy usage in the world, and provides a hypothetical scenario in which current world energy usage is balanced with theoretical possible sustainable energy output. It delves into the current limitations of the world's energy model, and discusses possible solutions. The physics and mathematics involved in the course are all fairly basic, and are mostly just &quot;back of the envelope&quot; calculations.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is highly knowledgeable in the subject and is keen and enthusiastic. He takes time at the beginning of every class to summarize the key points of the previous lecture, as well as runs through a course outline, making it easy to understand the progress made. He is open to answering questions after class or during his office hours. He is very fond of Maserati as well, despite teaching a sustainable energy class xd.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading was based on several instances of in-class peer work, a small group project, a mid-term and a final examination. As the exams are all open book, attaining a decent grade is not hard with a bit of effort.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload in this course was minimal. There were no assignments throughout the course, and only one group project that involved summarizing a journal into 2 pages. The mid-term and final examinations were also fairly consistent with the course content, and the questions asked were all familiar. Along with the open-book nature of the exams, preparing for them wasn't too much of a hassle.",

By pretty much simple calculations on energy expenses of our daily life, and optimised calculations on production of renewable energies, the course have reached its aim on discovering sustainability and also on teaching about energy expenses that we have in our daily life. <br /><br />Although the content is fairly easy, and the course is not challenging at all, this course successfully expanded my views on the sustainability of the world in terms of energy, and made myself more aware of our everyday expenses.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching is great, very clear teaching and quite in-depth with a lot of supporting examples. Although a lot of stuff are learnt for me already I still attend his classes. <br /><br />Just one thing to note is that he doesn't like people chatting in his lessons (except for pair-share exercises). He would stop speaking if he heard people talking in between. <br /><br />If there is anything else that I have to note about... Hmmm I quite like this professor 😂😂😂 (wait what",

            "comment_workload": "Three assignments, a project report (article review), midterm and final. <br /><br />Assignments are not hard, could be done within an hour. <br /><br />Project report - recommended to start it early, so that you have more chances to ask the professor for opinions and help. The project report is an article review that mainly is about rounding up an article on the production of sustainable energy. The length of the article review may be no longer than two pages, so a lot of work is payed on whether to put some parts or not. Quite a lot of teamwork needed for that, or else such may lead to unwanted arguments. <br /><br />Midterm is fairly easy, a basic calculation problem, a long question and then some MCQs. <br /><br />Final is harder since the calculation is much longer, but still managed to do so since it is an open-book(actually laptop) exam. Format is almost the same as the midterm.",

Easy A-range.<br />If you attend lesson and do the pair-share exercises (8 in total) you will receive extra marks.The midterm and final exams are both open books and open computers.(no access to the internet).<br />The exam is mainly focus on basic calculations and one follow up question about the topic. The Mcs are all very easy but the units might be bit tricky is you are not familiar with them.",

I'm pretty sure people would be scoring this section on USTspace depending on their final grade as that was basically the entire grade.<br /><br />homework - 15%<br />project report - 15%<br />mid term exam - 30%<br />final exam - 40%",

But spending 6-8 hours on these is more than sufficient.<br /><br />I wish they would add more homework or projects because this course is like a book you read before bedtime.",
