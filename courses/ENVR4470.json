            "comment_content": "This course is equivalent to CIVL 4470. You can take either of them for major electives.<br /><br />The content is simple to follow.<br /><br />Before midterm:<br />Introduction &amp; history about air pollution<br /><br />WHO's air quality objectives and air quality standards in different countries<br /><br />Air quality management philosophy<br /><br />Air quality index (to discuss the difference between standard- and risk-based index and how to calculate them) <br />How to calculate emission inventories<br /><br />Basics of meteorology (e.g. mixing height, lapse rate, planet boundary layer). Very simple and no need to understand the details<br /><br />Box model and Gaussian model<br /><br />After midterm:<br />Advanced air quality models in terms of emission-based models and receptor models (no need to understand the math behind but only the concepts)<br /><br />Control of different pollutants (like PM, NOx, VOC, SO2...). Much time is spent on particulate matter. Still, no need to understand the math behind but only the concepts.",
            "comment_teaching": "98% of the course content is delievered by Prof. Che Wenwei. Prof. Lau only provides some supplementary information to students. The PowerPoint is enough for you to get an A (at least for me). Just remember to attend lectures and take notes because many answers to exams are given verbally by Prof. Che and u can't find them in lecture notes.",

Mean 10.4/15 --&gt; 15%<br />Final 25 MCQ: 86/100. Mean 75/100 --&gt; 40%<br /><br />My overall score is 89.4. The mean should be around 79. The grade is A. Very good grade. Just make sure ur overall score is &gt;85 to guarantee an A-.",
            "comment_workload": "Term paper costs me 1 week to go. U should collect enough info and papers to support ur suggestions to existing Hong Kong's air management system. Also, the format is important (Intro, discussions, conclusion, graphs, etc.)<br /><br />Assignments are easy. Just need some simple calculations and algebra. Calculus and linear algebra are not required.<br /><br />Exams are all MCQ. Most are concept Q. Calculation Q are simple .",
