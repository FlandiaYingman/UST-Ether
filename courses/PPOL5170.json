The course is designed to allow students to explore the challenges of implementing policy and to facilitate critical questioning of the techniques used by central and local governments to achieve these policies in both developed and developing countries. It will have a particular focus on public management and leadership in policy contexts that are characterized by complex systems, and policy areas that are characterized by a highly scientific/technical nature (energy systems, large scale infrastructure engineering projects/management, sustainable development, emergence of new technologies and risks, etc.).",
