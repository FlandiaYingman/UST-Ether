Worse than Cell Biology, Microbiology, and even Organic chemistry. <br />One suggestion for you is to take Medicinal Chemistry tgt if you are a chem minor student, You basically learn similar things there which brings you synergy in the study. <br /><br />Advice for those high achievers who think you are better than everyone and want to take the course:<br />1) think again, is it worth it to spend hours on drug names that you will never encounter <br />2) If yes, then spent your time memorizing drug names from day one<br />3) Personally feel that the drug names on the essential drug list are enough for your final exam, so if you are in hurry, stick with the drug list<br />4) for each drug: memorize PK, PD, contradiction<br />5) Pay special attention to PK as the exam covers a lot on that<br />6) go through youtube source to learn more beyond than PPT: https://www.youtube.com/c/SpeedPharmacology/playlists . Personally think the PPT is a bit messy, better to have an extra source to help to sort out the course<br />7) Just to make you learn better, I left the drug list below, I think its super helpful if you have it at first and drop-down note next to the drug.<br />8) Make tons of memory tricks: - olol&nbsp;&nbsp;(= the reverse of bb ) = beta blocker<br />9) Why? Why torturing yourself? Why UST? This course is just like lead molecules, it deteriorates brain cells. Besides, You probably will forget every drug name in two weeks after the exam. So Why?",

The exams are non-cumulative, but you still gotta memorise ~100 drugs for finals, IMAGINE. If you pay attention really well in class, and you revise REGULARly, you might be just fine. I didn't do that, but spent 5 full days trying to memorize half of the course materials..yeah that didn't work. Good luck",
