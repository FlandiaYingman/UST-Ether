        "description": "Maps are graphical representations of our surroundings. Mathematically, a map of the earth is a function from the two-dimensional sphere into the plane. To understand whether it can be done or how it can be done involves concepts from topology and differential geometry. There are also many fascinating stories about the development of various map drawing methods and their impacts on the development of human civilization",
