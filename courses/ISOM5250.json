Several business areas are covered in this course, for example, financial modeling, stock analysis, etc.Essential features of VBA needed for application development will be introduced as part of the course and hence no prior experience with VBA is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis is on extensive hands-on problem solving. Prior experience with Excel is recommended but not mandatory.The first four sessions of the course will introduce students to VBA. Students will gainhands-on experience working on small business problems to reinforce the concepts learnt during lecture. For students who already have some experience with VBA this could be considered as a refresher. The next threesessions of the course will involve students implementing several business applications andmodels using VBA. Students will submit a final project (working in groups of 2 or alone) of their choiceand present their projects in the last class.",
