We will start by analyzing the Bitcoin decentralized cryptocurrency that is the most popular existing blockchain application. We will examine in detail how Bitcoin transactions are created, how Bitcoins are mined, and what are the security guarantees of the protocol. Then we will look into other applications of blockchains, including smart contract execution, distributed storage, and alternative cryptocurrencies, by reviewing recent research literature.",
