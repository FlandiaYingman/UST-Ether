        "description": "The course integrates three traditionally separate disciplines, which are highly pertinent to landslides: socio-economics, geomorphology and hydrology, and soil mechanics using the latest quantitative treatment of fluid flow in hillslopes under variably saturated conditions and moisture-induced changes in the stress distribution in hillslopes. Through this course students will benefit from exposure to the viewpoint that considers geologic hazards as an intersection of science, engineering, and societal problems. The students will contribute to this active learning course by reading the assigned materials prior to the class. The classroom session consists of short quiz covering the basic concepts of the readings and open discussions where students are expected to generate questions that build and expand on the basic concepts.",
