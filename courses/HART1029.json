        "description": "In this highly practical performance-based theatre course, students will be exposed to dramatic works by influential modern and contemporary playwrights in diverse cultural and social backgrounds. Students will explore how drama as an art form operates to critically examine, deeply reflect and artistically transform stories, social phenomenon and human conditions in various cultures. Through the guided and imaginative journeys, students will have the opportunity to take on the roles of performers, directors and even designers to practice theatre-making skills. Students will apply drama knowledge and skills in studying, analyzing and performing plays of different genres with multicultural backgrounds including Greek & French, Singaporean & Chinese, American & German, and English & German. Throughout the course, students will often find themselves working in small groups and taking on various roles to explore the metaphors and meaning of the plays, turning the dramatic text on paper into a 3-dimensional performance, with specific performing styles and techniques.",
