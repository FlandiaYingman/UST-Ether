This is explained in a fair amount of detail &amp; can be quite overwhelming. I recommend attending the lectures as the lecture notes don't explain much. Later on, the multi-cycle and pipeline processors are explained &amp; use many of the concepts from the single-cycle processor. Overall the content isn't very difficult to understand, but there is quite a lot of content &amp; there are a lot of little things to pay attention to, i.e. if a specific calculation is signed, what addressing mode is used, etc.",

            "comment_grading": "It's fair; Vivian was more lax on the first HW compared to the 2nd one, so a lot of people lost marks because they didn't include units i.e. 0X for hex &amp; 0b for binary. Dont have access to the course page anymore so cant give any specific grades.",
            "comment_workload": "It's alright; 4 labs aren't hard but extremely tedious &amp; time-consuming. 2 HW assignments are alright &amp; a midterm and a final. For some reason, the midterm was a lot more difficult than the final, so try to get a good mark for the midterm to get ahead as the final mean was a lot higher than the midterm.",

However, after learning the part after midtermm, you can find many different parts of the course can be linked together, and it's much easier to understand.

And four labs, except for lab 1, the things you need to do in lab 2 3 4 is to write the result of the MIPS program and observe it, which you do not need to write the program by yourselves because it has already provided for us, it is not hard. Although the task in this course may not be difficult, it does not mean that the course is easy, we still need to put some effort to fully understand the organization of computer, cause it is not like math or physic, we can learn math and physic by solving problem, but computer organization require more observation and understanding, and I think it may be the reason the professor does not give us a lot of task, cause it will be better for us to test and observe the program by ourselves.",

Initially i wanted to give this course a chance, thinking that it was only me who fked up the proj and got a shit grade,&nbsp;&nbsp;but judging from goop's reaction it seems that many people got c range in 2020 fall too so I wrote this review to warn whoever is planning to take this course: you might be better off taking COMP2611. <br />Originally, when I started taking this course, I was told that it only has hw (20%), midterm (30%)&nbsp;&nbsp;and final (50%), but then one week before the midterm, the prof just suddenly decided that it was not fair to hold online exams (??????) and decide to change the grading to hw (50%) and a final project. Seriously WTF after i fked up all hws and you tell me this????? And i didnt even know what my proj scores are, and I just directly got a C in the end :)",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is fine, since I didnt put a lot of effort in this course, there are only a couple of homeworks and a final project (which looks something like a comp assignment), but since this course is new and prof likes to make last-minute arrangements, this might not be the case for other semesters. Supposedly this course should have a midterm and a final, but it was replaced by a project instead.",
