Over one semester, students will attend three hours of class and will be expected to complete up to six hours of out-of-class work, per week. The course focuses on two areas:<br /><br />Part 1: Communication in Professional Contexts In the workplace, engineers often have to communicate with mixed audiences of other engineers and business people. In this part of the course, you will focus on talking and writing about technology to mixed audiences. <br /><br />Part 2: Communication skills for ECE projects You will enhance your ability to write and speak about academic projects in ECE,&nbsp;&nbsp;focusing on your ECE Final Year Project . In this part of the course you will focus on communicating with an academic audience.",
            "comment_teaching": "I was initially taught by Eric, but I switched to Angie because of time clashes with other courses.<br /><br />Having worked in engineering-related companies for many years, Eric is an experienced lecturer. However, he has a slightly slow pace of teaching.<br /><br />Angie is an excellent lecturer as she explains everything relevant to us very clearly. I remembered her being the instructor of the workshop group back in HUMA1000F in 2019-20 Spring, though I did not preform well in humanity subjects. She is responsible for the lectures and would reply to our e-mails, answering our questions as well as providing personal feedback to our assignments for us to improve ourselves. Just be proactive and try to ask her anything you don't understand, and she'll try to answer your question in a timely manner.<br /><br />She also has a keen sense of time management, being able to finish the teaching ahead of every assignment ahead of time. Students can have ample time to complete the assignments or consult with her in case we have any difficulties.<br /><br />Angie pays a lot of attention to how much time and effort is put into the LANG course, so you do not want to be late for attendance. If you attend all her lectures and remember everything that was discussed in her lectures, it's hard to fail.<br /><br />By the way, you need to assume you're going for a real interview in the first spoken assessment. In other words, you can get bonus points if you wear a suit and take off you mask while taking the video presentation.",

Peer review of presentation, 5% of total LANG 4031 grade<br />4. Introduction and Literature Review to an ECE project report, 1000-1300 words, 25% of total LANG 4031 grade<br />5. Poster presentation, 5 minutes (individual) or 8 minutes (group), poster in electronic format and needs to follow the template from your department, 25% of total LANG 4031 grade",
            "comment_workload": "Although there's a course schedule in Canvas, Angie does not strictly follow it and has her own teaching plan. Frankly speaking, that schedule of hers was miles better. It really helped lessen our workload and gave us an extra week to complete each assignment or consult her instead of the intended one week according to the official schedule.<br /><br />As she said, communication is important. Let her know if you have any midterms coming and she'll try to rearrange the lessons. I find it very flexible and manageable this way.",
