        "description": "This course covers the basic theories and applications of language-based and interactive intelligent system using deep learning. Topics include distributional semantics with word embeddings, text classification, emotion recognition, sentiment analysis from text and speech, and language modeling, with neural networks and back-propagation, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We will also cover multi-linguality and multi-modality, end-to-end chatbots, and task-oriented dialogue systems. Students will learn about various natural language processing (NLP) tasks related to building interactive intelligent systems, how to design and build a deep learning model using PyTorch and Python, and the basics of software engineering. At the end of the course, students will work alone or in pairs to implement a deep learning model for various NLP research tasks, and describe their methods and results in a conference paper format. Successful groups will be able to submit their papers to an international conference.",

Good Teaching and Well Written Lecture Notes<br />5. Good Grading<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Unlike the course COMP4221 taught by Dekai and COMP4901K taught by Prof Song. This course focus on solving the NLP problem via Deep Learning. But, it is good to take COMP4901K or COMP4221 before taking this course in order to have some basic ideas of NLP and NLP in ML. Since the teaching speed of this course is extremely fast, although the professor said you don't need to have any deep learning prerequisites.<br /><br />Rich Contents<br />The following topics are covered:<br />1. Introduction to Interactive Intelligent Systems<br />2. Empathetic Natural Language Processing <br />3. Regression and Neural Networks <br />4. Linguistic Essentials<br />5. Lexical Semantics and Word Embeddings<br />6. Sentiment Analysis<br />7. Convolutional NN Applications<br />8. Language Modeling and Recurrent NN in NLP<br />9. Sequence-to-Sequence and Attention in NLP<br />10. Introduction to Task-oriented Dialogue Systems<br />11. Automatic Speech Recognition in Dialogue Systems<br />12. Semantic Decoding in Dialogue Systems <br />13. Style Transfer: Deep Learning for Art <br />14. Recent Trends in Interactive Intelligent Systems<br /><br />Difference and Similar Points to COMP4901K and COMP4901J:<br />1. Unlike COMP4901K just giving you some introductory materials of each topic. This course will focus on each topic deeply.<br />2. Some advance topic such as Semantic Decoding and Speech Recognition were taught.<br />3. You can treat this as the NLP Version of COMP4901J.",
            "comment_teaching": "Some people might already know about the rumor of Pascale and her husband.<br /><br />However, in terms of the teaching quality. She is quite good and even above the average. She can clearly explain the important point of each topic in the lecture note with his native English. And the content of this course are designed quite well and systematic.<br /><br />Moreover, the lecture note are well written.",

            "comment_workload": "10% Attendance<br />40% Tutorial (4 Tutorials)<br />25% Group Project<br />25% Midterm<br /><br />I would say, the workload of this course is middle to high when it is compared to other COMP courses (Excluding the courses taught by CK). Since it required you to build the Neural Network using Pytorch to solve some NLP Problems from stretch. Unlike some course just give you many codes and only require you to fill in some blanks. However, four Tutorials are well designed. You can gain a lot of experience in building NN after completing four tutorials.<br /><br />For the group project (2 People), it is a research like project. You can choose any topic related to NLP and you need to implement some new things for that topic and write an report.",
