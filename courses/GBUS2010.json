As for my year, Christopher taught Consulting 101 for the first half of the course; Thian taught Financial modelling for the second half. Christopher is a very calm and precise man, while Thian is more casual. You'd have to be extremely talented to impress Christopher as he's been teaching this course for a long time.",

They are not particularly hard. However, when you are with a group of perfectionists, yourself included, it'd be worthy as you'd have grown a lot.",

            "comment_content": "First half taught by CD focuses on consulting, learning and applying models to analyse the business, using charts to present insights and finding the key issues and root cause of the case. <br />Second half taught by Thian focuses more on financial modelling and presentation. <br />In total you will work on 4 cases with two teams. Your teammates will play a huge part throughout the course as it is very likely that you will have to meet 3-4 times a week to work on the assignments, if you're lucky you will get to know them better and make some good friends.",
            "comment_teaching": "Experimental learning is how I would describe this course. During the 3 hour &quot;lecture&quot;, CD usually picks 2 teams to present in front of the class and give comments, it might feel scary at first and his comments can be quite harsh but you will soon adapt to it, it is a great learning experience. <br />As for Thian he is more casual and tries to go through the content on the slides as much as possible, he also give out in-class exercise so your team gets to practice before having to do the actual work during the week.",
            "comment_grading": "Good grading, most people land in the A range. Suggest that you just try your best in the course and focus on the group work instead of worrying about the grading.",
            "comment_workload": "This course is known to be extremely tough due to its tremendous amount of workload. Long meeting hours is common thus it is better that the team tries to come up with more efficient ways to communicate and work together or else you will have to sacrifice a lot of personal time on this course. <br />Basically the more effort you put into the coursework the more you learn, no pain no gain.",
