        "name": "Neuroethology: From Neurons to Behavior",
        "description": "This course will introduce the exciting discoveries by neuroscientists who investigate the biological foundations of behavior. Much success in this arena has come from the study of animals whose behavioral requirements for survival can be clearly specified and whose nervous systems reveal characteristics to support species-specific behaviors. Noteworthy examples include echolocation in bats, prey localization in barn owls, and communication in songbirds. Our goal will be to integrate data from studies at different levels of the system, and our weekly discussions will center on themes such as ecological constraints on behavior and dedicated neural systems. Students without the prerequisites but possess relevant knowledge may seek instructor's approval for enrolling in the course.",
