        "description": "This course presents a unique opportunity for students to experience the process of preparing learning activities in contrast to being taught. The experiential program will provide a preview to potential students who wish to pursue a teaching career. Students will develop teaching tools for secondary school students under the guidance of instructors. They will participate in organizing a science camp in which they will deliver their teaching tools through innovative learning activities such as analyzing movie clips using the knowledge of science. The experiential course also serves to strengthen students' concepts in science, and improves their organization and presentation skills which are important in future success. Instructor's consent is required for enrollment.",
