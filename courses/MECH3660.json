            "comment_content": "This course taught some first-order approximation of engine performance. By &quot;first-order&quot; I mean the calculation process isn't that precise (such as making extensive ideal gas assumptions) when compared with CFD or so, which are only intended for analysis at first glance. The contents are divided as follows:<br />1. Introduction to propulsion<br />2. Aerodynamics and thermodynamics revision<br />3. Propulsion performance metrics<br />4. Engine intake notation and rating certification<br />5. Nozzle<br />6. Engine inlet<br />7. Turbojet<br />===Midterm===<br />8.1. Turbofan introduction<br />8.2. Bypass ratio<br />8.3. Dynamic scaling<br />8.4. Compressor<br />8.5. Combustor<br />8.6. Turbine<br />9. Aircraft and engine noise<br /><br />In addition, a visit to HAESL (Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Limited) was also included in the course. It was not mandatory (though it could clash with the projects and the exhausting lab reports at MECH3690), but you are strongly advised to participate as an extracurricular activity.<br /><br />In general, the contents are calculation-heavy and not that hard, if not the thrust definition at Chapter 3 could baffle you. Particularly one should try to familiarize with cycle analysis, which would be a major topic examined in exams.",
            "comment_teaching": "Through past reviews one may have heard of many stories about Professor Zhang. He was indeed a strict person. Latecomers were scolded at their face, and this was also the same for those who made excessive noise. Unlike Professor Redonnet (the Frenchman), he didn't care much about using phones (so scrolling down your phone to find lecture notes are OK), as long as you don't disturb his lectures.<br /><br />As there was a MECH3620 tutorial session before his Tuesday lectures, students didn't want to risk his anger for being late after some post-tutorial discussion. Combined with those traumatized of his emotional burst (a student claimed attendance plummeted after he scolded 2 gossipers), this make his lecture's attendance very low.<br /><br />Professor Zhang indeed noticed abnormality during the latter phase of the course and claimed this semester was his least-attended course throughout his teaching experience. it seemed that his requirements were somewhat loosened at that time: I've seen somebody came late in April-May without being scolded by him.<br /><br />Apart from these aspects, Professor Zhang was generally a nice lecturer who delivered course contents clearly. Daily experiences were used to convey concepts, for example, lighting a cigarette at a windy day was compared with the ignition process in a turbofan engine's combustion chamber. He's also quite caring to students: as a student who used paper notes, at one time he asked whether he needed to slow down his speed (so that I can make timely notes). His engineering career in Rolls Royce and Airbus was also exceptionally rich, and he often mention them in his lectures. Professor Zhang's English was generally clear with some noticeable accent, which should be satisfactory in understanding.<br /><br />I didn't attend most tutorials, but for the tutorials (and some less-important lectures) I attended, Dr. Etienne Spieser was the TA in charge. He was nice, but his tutorials were disasters. He spent most of the tutorials on explaining contents introduced by the Professor again, leaving very little time on solving and explaining practice questions. I consider his performance unsatisfactory, especially given by the lack of assignments in this course. The Chinese TAs could do better, but I didn't attend their tutorials and cannot comment more.",
            "comment_grading": "Attendance: 10% (presumably full?)<br />Midterm: 30% (91/100, mean and median unknown)<br />Final: 60% (Never released per MAE practice)<br />*There is no homework/assignments<br /><br />Attendance was counted, albeit it was ignored by the majority who skipped lectures.<br /><br />The midterm was an open-book exam with easy calculation problems, though you should keep an eye on the brainteasing true-false questions, and make sure you understand tutorial notes (as some questions were extracted from tutorial notes). The final exam was another story though. It was a closed-book exam with only a formula sheet available. Some claimed such difference was a revenge for the low attendance rate, in which I can neither support or deny without evidence.<br /><br />Given by the close proximity with the final report submission deadline of MECH3620, many students were ill-prepared. As mentioned above you are strongly advised to do a few cycle analysis questions, as they were the most standard, least changed, and most scored questions in the final exam. That said, other calculation and essay questions also existed, so please do revise on other contents as well if you have time.<br /><br />Ended with an A grade, which is satisfactory to me.",
            "comment_workload": "As the course didn't have any homework, the course was almost workload free. Things obviously get tenser before exams. You are advised to re-do the examples in lecture and tutorial notes during revision. If you want to excel, you could also try the textbook's questions, in which they were the sources of some examples as well.",

            "comment_content": "About gas turbines, big part of the course involves calculation of stagnation pressure and temperature within different stage of a bypass engine, also the different efficiencies, bypass ratio, etc. it can be messy but the example given is quite clear, follow the flow and you would be fine even if you do not follow the lecture. <br /><br />Study the example as some questions appeared will be exactly the same except change of numbers.<br /><br />In general, if you are interested about propulsion mechanism of different aircraft and details within a engine, the content is pretty good.",
            "comment_teaching": "all zoom lectures so can't comment exactly how good if it is in person, but seeing him constantly disconnects and having lag with his mcdonald's internet is actually quite funny.<br />after a few lectures of chaos he changed his internet and it was alright, his explanations are clear, english is satisfactory and clear enough to understand, and he seems passionate about the subject so I respect that.<br /><br />be careful during exams, he transforms into a bitch and will cut you down if you do anything close to violating rules, I got fucked, so did my friends, he has no mercy when he enters his final form and trust me you dont want to see that, I am traumatized until this very moment.<br /><br />Apart from that, nice guy and ok teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "the content is not so hard, so the mean is quite high, but if you follow everything and pay attention to the examples in class, it's not hard to get a B.<br /><br />pay attention in exam as alot of calculations are involved and can really stress you out, we had the luxury to do the exams online and look at the examples while attempting, but in the future, make sure you print everything out and know where to get to the examples quickly.",
            "comment_workload": "For a third year course, really not much to do, just 4 assignments, and all of them are quite short. just don't be an idiot and do everything last minute.<br /><br />The real workload comes from reading the examples and understanding them, and revisions. There are quite a lot of concepts to remember and the flow of the calculation are also a pain in the ass to remember, but put some effort, it will be manageable.",
