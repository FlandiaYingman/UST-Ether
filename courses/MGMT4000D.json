        "description": "The course introduces students to core legal principles of transnational economic law and the mechanisms for the settlement of trade and investment disputes. The topics discussed are closely related to world-wide current events that affect transnational law and dispute resolution. The lectures cover decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that deal with the business activities of multinational private and state-owned corporations. The lectures examine how domestic, regional, and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. Moreover, the lectures explain to students how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment activities, ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students, and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy.",
