Good/Bad grade shd be determined by the grading curve (e.g. how many % ppl get A/B/C range).<br /><br />For me<br />2 Quiz (20%): above median (most gets similar scores, close to 85%)<br />MT (40%): 31/40 (LQ 22 median 27 UQ 31)<br />Final (40%): 82.5/100 (LQ 54 median 68 UQ 77.5 Mean 66 SD 15.4)<br />Resulting grade: B+. In final i get 1.1 SD above mean still B range, thus bad grade course. I guess my total score i should be around 18-20th percentile. <br /><br />So it implies she gives less than 20% A range, which UST suggests 20-25%. Real good grade course could give even high as 30%.",

            "comment_teaching": "Prof Tsang's accent and pronunciation are very easy for people to understand.<br />She is willing to answer students' questions.<br />She sometimes ends the lecture early.<br />However, I don't recommend you attend the lectures. The two reasons are as follows:<br />The students there are very noisy.<br />In every lecture, she gave us 10 minutes to solve a problem and used 5 minutes to explain but the problem can usually be solved within a minute.<br />So I'd recommend watching the lecture videos instead.",
            "comment_grading": "Online Quiz 1: 10%<br />Online Quiz 2: 10%<br />Midterm: 40%<br />Final: 40%<br />Midterm consists of MCQ.<br />Final consists of MCQ and short questions.<br />Note that midterm and final are equally important.<br />My score:<br />Online Quiz 1: 75/75<br />Online Quiz 2: 39/40<br />Midterm: 37/40<br />Final: 91.5/100<br />Grade: A+<br />I don't see any reason to say this course is 爛龜(bad grade).<br />Just have a bigger brain.",
