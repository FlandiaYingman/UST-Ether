        "description": "Smart and sustainable solutions are globally on the rise. Product developers, designers, engineers from all sectors use Life Cycle Assessment to use quantitative evidence to proof that their product or innovation is truly more sustainable than existing solutions. Life Cycle Assessment is one of the most commonly used tools to measure the environmental, social and financial cost of a product or system and to allow a fair comparison. In this class students will (1) learn how to assess environmental life cycle impacts and identify options for resource conservation, and pollution prevention; (2) apply methods for Life Cycle Assessment on various products and systems, interpret results and judge the associated uncertainties; (3) interpret and evaluate case examples to gain a deeper understanding of the strengths, weaknesses and appropriate use of Life Cycle Assessment; (4) learn the necessary software basics to perform a moderately complex LCA under supervision.",
