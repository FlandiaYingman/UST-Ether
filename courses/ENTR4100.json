        "description": "Building a social enterprise can be markedly different from building a commercial one. When well deployed, social innovations can meet social needs that the government welfare, business corporations or charity-based social welfare cannot easily fulfill. A commercial entity should also be aware of the social impacts of its business decisions. This course introduces corporate social responsibility (CSR), social innovations, and the factors of consideration to start a social enterprise. This includes current topics on operation models, sustainability, team building, case studies, strategies, practices, etc. Site visits and student projects will be involved.",
