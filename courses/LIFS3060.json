Banfield tries to make the course relatable to general citizens (as shown by the extra slides that tell you what the chapter will teach general citizens). He puts special emphasis on how the microbes interact with you.<br /><br />For detailed listing see attachment",
            "comment_teaching": "Oh Prof. Banfield... I guess his teaching style is just very controversial.<br />Some people may say he's very mean and vengeful because of what they did to him (and how he responded) in Fall 14/15 Cell Biology. But like, if you're a decent human being, you'll think he's a fair and predictable person that won't take your bullshit. Is he sarcastic? Yes. But is he fair in his teaching, exam question setting and in his character? Yes (his exam questions aren't easy, but if you studied you'd do decently well -- there are always a few questions that come out of nowhere but that's just him trying to distinguish between the top students; nothing to do with the general crowd since no one can get the questions anyway and so the curve is just skewed lower).<br />To me, his sarcasm does not really deter me in an academic setting. I think it's his way of being an interesting human being (versus a boring, reading off the slides professor that you'll hate a lot more). Prof. Banfield is a typical Canadian -- funny and sarcastic (and he does like to make fun of his American &quot;friends down South&quot;). And in class, his character can translate into a lot of jokes and a less boring lecture. Not sure if the jokes are intentional, but his character definitely makes me enjoy class a lot more.<br />If you have questions/issues, you can definitely email him or ask him after class. He really cares about his students and tries as much as he can to help if they have problems. I've emailed him about a lot of issues and he kindly helped me through all of them.<br />If you want to talk about your exams, you can also just email him and set up a time. He'll be happy to talk about what you did wrong and how you can improve.<br />(side note: I guess that's why he was so angry about the Fall 14/15 incident anyway. If you have a problem, he would be happy to discuss it with you. That's how he functions. You don't bitch about him behind his back.)<br /><br />Jessica is pretty normal as everyone says... Teaches to the slide, gives relatively easy, straight-off-lecture-slides exam questions. Her LearnSmart assignments were also a lot lighter compared to Banfield's.<br />Jessica is very approachable if you have questions. She's such a sweetie pie.",
            "comment_grading": "With the LearnSmart, the class grade actually improved a lot this year, I heard.<br />I personally got an unexpectedly high grade that could not be predicted by my midterm and final scores.",
            "comment_workload": "He tried out an extra thing this year for extra credit, &quot;LearnSmart&quot; -- a few hundred questions per week or so to test your understanding on the material (you'll have to buy LearnSmart and do 100% of it to get the extra credit, and you can also choose to buy the ebook on top of it. The ebook is recommended since it really helps you answer the questions). It's legit &quot;extra credit&quot; that he adds AFTER he gives out the initial grades though, so you don't get penalized if you don't do it (but in the future he said he'll try to make it a legit assignment for the class; good luck poor kids)... A ridiculous amount of work? Yes. Helpful though? Also yes. It's very likely that he will cut the workload when he makes it a legit class assignment to cater to all students (not only the hard-working ones). He did say that he had to make the extra credit thing a lot more extra work to warrant extra credit, so hopefully he'll cut down on LearnSmart content if he's counting them for the actual grade? I guess we'll find out this year.",

But I still find the Mid-Term questions rather complicated, and not that straight forward<br /><br />Content from Dr. Tang are mostly about pathogens how they affect our body, how our body response to it, and how to remove it. I do find the content rather interesting and relatable to daily life. It is not the very theoretical microbiology content if that's what you are expecting. To me there are a lot of memorisation of facts, not that much understanding of complex mechanisms involved. Usually the mechanisms are briefly mentioned only",

So one would still need to spend time throughly understand all the content.<br /><br />As for Final, over 600 pages of ppt to memorise, and almost all little ting within the ppt would be examined. If you are wondering, you do need to memorise the following:<br />1. All the orange vocabs and it defintion.<br />2. All the bacteria species/ disease/ effect/ method to eliminate and everything related to it.<br />3. All biochemical test / agar/ whatever tests and how to interpretative.<br />4. All the equations and how they differ.<br />or just remember everything you can.<br /><br />And do start early for revision, try your best to memorise some parts after the lecture is delivered. As a reference, I don't consider myself to have good memory, and 10 days is not enough for me to remember all the content. <br /><br />Good luck to you all.",

As many time was spent in joking and answering student question ;) so the course content is not much in Prof Banfield's part and the midterm content is fine to review.<br /><br />Dr Tang's teaching is also good and her English is pretty fluent. There are some fill in the blank questions at the beginning of each lesson for reviewing previous lesson. I think that's quite useful.
