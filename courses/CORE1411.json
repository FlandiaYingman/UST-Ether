            "comment_teaching": "Instructor DU uses her lecture slides, which are pretty helpful than the book endorsed for this course. But I have used the book for extra practice since this is the first time I have taken a language course. <br /><br />Classes are interactive, and she always asks if there are problems with the topics. She also tries to add some extra sessions for practising if you want to improve some areas in Chinese.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She also gives you additional time in her office before the exams if you have any topic issues.",
            "comment_grading": "Attendance is necessary for this course. Try not to miss more than two classes unless you have a good explanation (because they can lower your grade by one unit, e.g. B to B-). Instructor DU is very lenient on this part; one of my friends said he could skip up to five classes. BUT, you should not take my word for it. ATTEND EVERY CLASS. <br /><br />The midterm exam is doable if you work hard enough. However, the listening part was very tough for me, so I had to practice extra for this. For speaking and reading, as long as you meet the requirements (which the teacher will give you before the exam) and the tones correctly, you can get fairly good feedback.<br /><br />The finals have a huge leap in difficulty, the listening gets faster, and they mix the information here and there, so you have to listen to it and jot down the important points and find the answer. The speaking and reading parts are more or less the same. <br /><br />Since this is a common core course, the grading is absolute. And they do not give marks for the speaking, but rather feedback. <br /><br />My scores,<br />Midterm,<br />Listening - 13.3/15<br />Reading - 9.4/10<br />Speaking - Advanced-Exceptional (Overall)<br /><br />Final Term,<br />Listening - 14.625/15<br />Reading - 9.6/10<br />Speaking - Advanced-Exceptional (Choice of Vocabulary)<br />- Advanced (Choice of Grammar)<br />- Advanced (Pronunciation and Fluency)<br /><br />Reflection Task - Advanced-Exceptional<br /><br />Blended Learning - 10/10 (Canvas Assignments)<br /><br />Overall Grade - A+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is manageable; find some good partners to do the assignments since they require speaking in a group. Instructor DU gives full marks to every assignment regardless of the quality of the work, as long as you submit them (Follow the instructions in the canvas properly).<br /><br />There are optional assignments (they won't add to your grades regardless you submit them or not) in Canvas which are pretty helpful for practising listening and reading. At the end of the semester, you must write a self-reflection on how you approached learning a new language (strategy and learning guides); they do not look at the English skills but your content.",

I found the listenings to be very difficult for me, since I had never studied Chinese before. In the first exam, the audio was only played once, and the people spoke quite fast, so I found it difficult. In the second exam though, the audio was played twice.<br /><br />At least an 80% attendance is required, or else the final mark is decreased by a fraction.",
            "comment_workload": "Only four mandatory oral practices that consisted in recording a 3 minutes video of a monologue or dialogue.
