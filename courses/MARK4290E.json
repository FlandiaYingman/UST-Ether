            "comment_content": "The whole course is basically a powerpoint that's around 130 pages, with not a lot of content. He teaches about ways of digital marketing, and the classes have a lot of commercial watching, and analyzing what's good and bad.",
            "comment_teaching": "Eugene is an amazing professor. He actually tries to help you learn things that are useful in real life, and helps you get used to a lot of marketing terms. It's mostly lecture based, but he's pretty funny and talks pretty slow.",
            "comment_grading": "Attendance kind of matters. I did pretty well on all of the exams but skipped a few classes where he counted the attendance, and got an A instead of A+. Otherwise, it's pretty lenient because it's not graded on a bell curve.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is really little. There's no assignments or finals, just 3 'midterms' which are take home exams that take around 2 hours each to finish.<br /><br />He gave 2 readings for the class which are really easy to read, but reading it makes a difference.",
