        "description": "The course is intended to prepare students for the Quantitative Social Analysis Capstone Project by giving them practical experience in the quantitative analysis of social data by independently applying skills acquired in their required and elective methods courses. Students will either conduct a small research project related to the theme of a topical course in the Division of Social Science in which they are concurrently enrolled, or complete an internship that involves application of skills learned in their methods courses. Enrolled students will meet as a class at regular intervals during the semester and submit a final report. Students who plan to carry out a project are expected to be simultaneously enrolled in a topical Social Science course. Graded P or F. May be only taken twice. For QSA students only. Instructor's approval is required for enrolling in the course.",
