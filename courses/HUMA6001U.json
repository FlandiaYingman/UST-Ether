        "description": "This course will employ an interdisciplinary approach to examine literary and pictorial magazines and journals from the late Qing to the Republican era. Keeping in mind contemporary theories of the public sphere, travel, and the interaction between image and text, we will explore critical issues around the innovative writing practices associated with new print media, the formation of a literary public space, the role of the editor, publisher and reader, as well as the dynamics between image and word.",
