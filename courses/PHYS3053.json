            "comment_content": "非常標準的 Griffiths電動力學。課程內容分為 main lecture 與 honors lecture 兩部份。<br /><br />Main lecture 基本上就是 Griffiths ch.1-7的內容，但基於時間關係 (應該)，ch.7 Electrodynamics 只輕輕帶過 Faraday’s Law, Maxwell Equations, EM wave就算了。老實說，以一些 PHYS1114 / PHYS1314 教過的內容作結實在令這個 course 的結尾遺憾地有點遜 zzzzz。<br /><br />Honors Lecture 的內容大致上可以分為兩半。Prof 大概會用一半的honors lectures 來教一些稍微更深入的理論內容，包括 conservation laws &amp; continuity equations, EM energy &amp; momentum, the potential formulation, gauge transformation, etc…說白點就是從Griffiths ch. 8 - 10 中挑岀來的一些內容。雖說是有點沒誠意，但我覺得這些內容算是選得還不錯，至少我也算有學到點皮毛。倒是這堆 honors lecture 課與課之間內容都跳很大，幾乎沒甚麼連貫性可言，而且全部內容都僅僅點到即止，所以說我其實也不覺得自己有從這些 honors lecture 裡多學到多少。<br /><br />而另一半的 honors lecture，prof 會用來教一些因難度稍高而在 regular 版 skip 掉的內容，包括 spherical image charge problem, “magnetostatic scalar potential&quot;, Laplace's equation in dielectric / magnetized material, etc.",
            "comment_teaching": "因為教授只有一個，但有兩門長得八成像的課，所以為節省人手，PHYS3033 跟 PHYS3053 的同學會一起上同一個Main lecture，然後當PHYS3033的同學在 Tutorial 歡樂 quiz 的時候，PHYS3053的各位苦主就要多上額外一小時的Honors lecture (其實每星期quiz好像比較痛苦)。<br /><br />我自己是挺喜歡這個設計。這樣一方面可以享受大班上課的樂趣，還不用一天到晚都跟那堆念書狂人困在一起，而另一方面也能享有小班教學的高質量教學 (相對地)。<br /><br />教授在 main lecture 基本上就是標準的朗讀 PowerPoint 政策，坦白說單看他 main lecture 的表現我 teaching 會評 C 或 D。寫了好幾個 PHYS course 的 review，我也懶得再對這種朗讀 PowerPoint 教學作甚麼評論。看 Griffiths 的書還比較有趣、易懂。<br /><br />不過教授在 honors lecture 倒是做得還不差。用白板教學，每一個步驟的內容跟目的他都會解釋得清清楚楚。他自己覺得他白板寫字寫很醜，我倒是覺得還好，至少比那堆 PowerPoint 上的 Equation 好看多了。",

As for the regular class (the same as PHYS3033), the content is exactly as in the textbook Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffith starting from chapter 1 to 7. While during the extra lectures, chapter 8 and 9 are discussed.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor likes to use power point, which I didn't really enjoy. The explanation is quite boring and although the professor often said that the mathematical part is less important, I feel that the course is mathematical. From the homework and exam problems, it is evident that the professor loves to use the method of separation variables, which is once you understand it quite easy. You don't have to come to the lectures if you have already understood the concept. Reading and understanding the textbook is what I recommend, as it is also a really good book. The professor though is opened for questions from students",

This was my grade booster, because many students encountered this course without previous knowledge and it may be difficult for someone really studying from zero. Therefore, the mean is quite low.

The syllabus covers the entirety of the 3033 syllabus (Griffiths Introduction to Electrodynamics Chs.1-7) plus whichever topics are presented during the honors lectures. The honors topics this term included sections of Griffiths Chs.8-10 plus some exercises. The honors topics were not assessed in the midterm but were in the final.",

The PowerPoint slides (available on CANVAS) contain everything you will need for the exams, and note-taking is mostly optional.",

The mean for the midterm was 22.2/40. I got a 24 on the midterm and don't know how I did on the final, ended up getting a B+.<br /><br />The midterm was of medium difficulty but time pressure was a significant factor. The final was somewhat easier but special arrangements (online exam) were made this term so this might not apply to future iterations of the course.",

Professor's Lortz powerpoint can be understood easily, but I suggest you to go through the textbook. Also, be sure to work through the exercises in the textbook, it is a good practice for students and the solutions can be found easily online.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Lortz is a very caring person, if you encounter any difficulties, just talk to him. He always welcome questions from students. One thing I partly disagree with him is that, to me, I prefer him to teach this course using marker pen rather than powerpoint, like during the honor's tutorial, which I enjoyed it very much. The lectures during the honor's tutorial are of the appropriate standard. However, those that involve horrible Math would not be tested as promised, but I suggest you to go through them too.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is not that bad and the difficulty of the exams is not that high, compared to my expectation. He mainly tested us on the concepts and does not expect us to work out the math during the exams. However, you will get horrible math in your assignments which is reasonable. You need a lot of triple integrals in this course, so be sure to master your multivariable calculus before taking this course. The exam problems for the honor version are not that difficult, so long you master the new concepts that the professor introduce to us, it should be fine. Furthermore, these can all be found in the textbook. I found the textbook very handy.",
            "comment_workload": "We roughly have an assignment each week. The problems given for our assignment are much more challenging than the exam problems. So be sure to take them seriously. I think the pressure for the PHYS 3033 course is much higher as they have quizzes every week and the problems can be challenging.",
