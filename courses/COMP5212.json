The fundamentals cover some mathematic basics (e.g., derivatives, matrix calculation, probability theory) and why machine learning works from theory level. This part is derived from UCLA CS 260. The other part focuses on recent advances in deep learning (e.g., transformers, GANs, semi-supervised learning).",

However, most of the time he would waste on the simple concepts and nearly skipped on what's unfamiliar to me (e.g., graph theory). Even some times the instructor receive no response for the question &quot;If someone understands, please raise your hand&quot;, leaving an awkward classroom atmosphere.",

For programming projects, you may Google it or search Github for the original answers (as I've said in the content section, it basically copies UCLA CS260). It contains just some simple prediction algorithms. However, for the written homework, it would cost a lot of efforts to dig into it since it is proofs to some of mathematical concepts with few reference you can refer to.",
