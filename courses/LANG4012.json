            "comment_content": "Similar to lang 3012, but focus is put into writing intro, abstract and discussion. Conclusion and experimental not covered because they are virtually the same as writing lab report. Since this course is about writing a good research report, a lot of attention is directed towards analyzing segments of research articles and identifying common elements in each section of a report. The balance between conciseness and engaging the reader is also emphasized.<br />the other important focus of the course is to improve presentation skills. we had a ton of class practices, mostly just casual chat or reflections from what we just learnt in class. Reb made sure we develop our communication techniques by encouraging us to talk louder/ have a good posture etc. We also had a practice 2 min presentation on a self-selected topic, and the feedback from classmates as well as Reb were very helpful.",
            "comment_teaching": "same with 3012, Reb is just an amazing instructor. If not for her, I would hate to have 10 straight days of 2 hour lectures in july. I enjoyed every moment of class, and I really retain what I have learnt in class.<br />11/10",
            "comment_grading": "45% each for report and 6-8 min presentation. rest is from class participation.<br />same with her 3012 class, you put effort into it, you get good grades out of it.<br />report 20.5/121; presentation 20.5/21. Grade not known yet<br /><br />Reb gave us feedback for our reports right after we had our presentations. We did not just have timely feedback, we get invaluable feedback!!! Comments on what we do well and what we can improve in presentation is also given right after presentation day, allowing us to have ample time to practice for Chem presentation.",
            "comment_workload": "Slightly heavier workload, but very reasonable. If you start planning early for report, it will be a breeze. Some ungraded written/reading homework, but they help you improve rather than make you wish you have access to homework bots.",
