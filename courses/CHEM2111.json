            "comment_teaching": "The professor had a slight accent, but quickly adapted to it. And the professor is very enthusiastic and patient. He will answer any questions patiently. Don't be afraid to ask him for advice on anything! But usually there are many students who do not attend. Although this class does not count attendance, I still recommend that you try to attend, because the effect of watching recording will be greatly reduced.",

Only 16.7%. I can't rule out that this is because the professor thinks the students' level is generally low. In fact, I also think that except for a few students who are very strong in this course, most of them feel that they are not studying properly. I did not play well in the final exam. I only got a lower grade than the midterm. But I still got an A-.<br />In addition, I think one of the difficulties in this course is that I don't know how to do the questions in the exam. The professor did not give us many practice questions. I borrowed the textbook before the midterm and final exams, and did all the questions after the class. But unfortunately, there is a big difference between the type of questions in the exam and the practice questions after the class. So I didn't learn too much from the questions. I think this is the reason why I didn't get a good grade in the final. I don't know how to prepare for this exam, so if you want to do well in this class, you should find a way to solve this problem.",
