            "comment_content": "Covers the history of Chinese oil painting from the 16th century to the current day. <br />The content itself is ok. The slides are clear to read and honestly much more helpful than the lectures. But a lot of names and terms are directly translated from Chinese, so it would be hard for non-Chinese speakers to memorize the content.",
            "comment_teaching": "It is obvious that she put considerable effort to prep for her lectures, but she uses repetitive vocab and never explains the content in-depth. <br /><br />She does rely too much on the powerpoint. The lecture is so boring that it is mentally impossible to stay focused even though you try to be a good student. <br /><br />But you can't skip class because attendance is required. Instead of improving her teaching skills, she prefers punishment than positive reinforcement: she doesn't seem to understand that you don't care about oil painting that much and she can take extreme measures for attendance.",

She just expects you to memorize the whole thing and tests you on the most unnoticeable triviality that has absolutely nothing to do with art appreciation.<br />100% guarantee that you will learn absolutely nothing in this class (if you don't see hard-core memorization as a skill).
