            "comment_grading": "20% group project<br />30% 2 highest quizzes<br />50% final exam<br /><br />The highest two quizzes will be counted (we have a total of 3 quizzes) and I'm around first 10% of class. I got about above 1.4 sd in final exam (90 something) and eventually got an A.<br /><br />But I would give grading a D because the exam and quizzes are actually testing students' ability to memorize things instead of understanding. E.g. a question appear in past paper asking if Confederation bridge in Canada is over 1 km, true or false? One question in quizzes asking whether the Takoma bridge collasped after how long it was built (wow for god's sake am I supposed to memorize the date??). Such unnecessary questions take around 20% of your quizzes and exam. If this is why it makes people think it is a GOOD GRADE course, I really have nothing to say. But if you are not good at memorizing, please take other courses for ssc s&amp;t.<br /><br />In fact, the grading is just by a normal UST curve, nothing more than that.I was once fooled by that review, believing that it would be easy to get a decent grade, which is totally a lie. I have known a few friends from this class, getting slightly above mean wont get u an a range in SPRING. And it is rather competitive, many people got above 90. If you want a good grade, this is not for you unless you are super in memorization. Think twice before you enrol.",
            "comment_workload": "People said the workload is low. NO FXXKING WAY. I admit that you experience light workload because you only have to attend lectures and no tutorials are needed throughout the semester. But I would say workload before quizzes and exam are UNBELIEVABLY high, if you want to score above mean and get a good grade. You have to memorize even stuff written at a small corner or something appear in a stupid picture or the height of a specific building (something like the ICC is 484m high) or where is the second tallest building in the world located, which makes people feel extremely exhausted during preparation and speechless during quizzes or exam. Especially due to the fact that final is cumulative, you have to memorize a total of 12 times 30+ pages of slides. Well, don't forget you still have other courses to study.<br /><br />Alert: THIS IS FAR FROM WHAT OTHERS STATED: A LIGHT WORKLOAD AND GOOD GRADING COURSE. I definitely won't recommend this to others.<br /><br />Important!! jot down notes during class",

The course is not only teaching theory or principles, but also introduces some practical methods on daily-life situation. I think the practical methods part is interesting and useful. It lets me know more about technology and how it can apply in the real world.<br />The course has covered many aspects of housing problem in Hong Kong. The instructor and students have discussed various solutions on this issue from different perspectives, such as civil engineering, finance and law. I think the course is meaningful because part of the course is discussed the most difficult problem in Hong Kong, the housing problem.

Each group has 8 persons so everyone just need to do little work and everything will be fine. Also, finding good teammates are important.( Me very lucky to get god teammates lo l)<br /><br />The Fina exam was a close book exam. You don't have to memorize everything in the powerpoints as long as you listen to the lectures. Around 2 days of study will be enough to get good grades. It lasted for 3 hours an dneed a lot of writing, but all the questions were easy. You should be able to complete it around 2 and a half hour.<br /><br />Final grade: A+ <br />very good grades",

He offered several test files and also several answer sheets in each excel file, so we had to move shuttlewise for the two different excel files. Also, he made a time limit in each test file so for example (I don't remember the exact time and the exact number of the test but whatever) we only had like 12 minutes to solve 12 problems in a file. Even I finished all of the quizzes in the file quickly, I cannot move to the previous test file or further one, just waiting til the new test file open. IT WAS TOTALLY USELESS. I still can't sincerely understand why he made that sort of test. It was very fresh in a terrible way. <br /><br />The grade was, well, maybe adequate.",

Some practice questions he gave us were helpful for the test I think. <br />Also the project was not so bad.",
