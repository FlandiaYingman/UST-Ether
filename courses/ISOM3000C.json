        "description": "This course is intended to train students to learn and develop AI applications by using practical and useful development tools. Students will learn basic AI models and analyze their advantages and disadvantages when they are applied in AI applications. The course is divided into 4-day intensive classes. It consists of two parts. The first part covers basic machine learning models and related tools. The second part introduces the development environment, tools, and hands-on labs for training, testing and evaluating AI applications using AI development tools. Having programming knowledge is a plus.",

Quite a hands-on course and you can regard this course as 4 3-hours labs.<br />This is good for your CV. You can actually use IBM Waston to build your own chatbot or do visual recognition.",
            "comment_teaching": "As this is a new course, the flow is rather clumsy. There are a lot of lab materials to go through and you can easily lose track of what's going on. Also, there are some bugs with the free version on the IBM Waston platform, which sometimes it may take a long time to run, or you just can't run it without knowing the reason.",

            "comment_workload": "The workload is so low as there are no labs submission and all you need to do is the project. It might take you some time to build the model depending on your project, but the platform is so user-friendly so it might not take you a long time to do.",
