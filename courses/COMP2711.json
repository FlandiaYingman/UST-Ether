However, some of the points he gone through was not deep enough, he might just use a simple example to explain sth that will be much more complex when it is in the exam. His ppt slides are sometimes too simple. He explained some complex stuffs quite well, and he is kind and nice to answer your questions. One more point, he sometimes write notes on his slides on his iPad, but his handwriting is a bit messy, his writings will overlap with the words on the slides and he will erase part of it to further explain sth else, which is hard to read/understand, sometimes you have to rewatch the video to understand what he is talking about. Overall, his teaching is good. <br /><br />The TAs are wonderful. They are helpful, nice, and are able to teach well. All TAs this year are very good. Sometimes if you got questions about your hw, you can feel free to email them and discuss with them, they can offer you good explanations. They did really well this year.

You cannot imagine how the knowledge learnt in class can be applied to some of the questions. The logic flow of those questions are hard to follow, especially for year 1 students, the exams are definitely not the ones you encountered in MATH 1013/1014... Btw the pre-requisite is not accurate, MATH 1013/4 don't help much here. <br /><br />Homework 20%<br />Mid-Term Exam 30%<br />Final Exam 50%<br /><br />The Homework part is not very difficult, and you should try your best to get as high marks as possible in you homework. However, even if you could score full marks in your hw, it means nth to the exams, as the exam questions are a lot harder than the hw questions. This situation is not that significant in the midterm but very severe in the final. Every question is like bonus level. I heard someone else saying that the final questions are harder than 2711H in fall (absolutely harder than 2711 in fall too), you can take a look at them in the attached files below. I personally agree with it. <br /><br />my stat:<br />Midterm: Touch mean<br />Final: 10 marks lower than mean (over 100)<br />HW: only one HW is below mean, others are nearly full<br />Grade = C range",

But make sure you have understood all the concepts, proofs, theorems (they are very important to remember as mostly they would be the key for you to do proving and solving) and examples(such as Monty Hall Problem and Towers of Hanoi, sometimes they would adjust those examples and put them into exams)<br />For the exams, I highly recommend doing every exercise and past paper they have provided. As you don't know how to do those questions because:<br />1. Some of the questions are mixed topics, you might not know how many/which concepts you need to use.<br />2. Sometimes you have to &quot;guess&quot; those questions, such as while doing a combinatorial proof or doing an induction step, you have to know what is the question saying and what the question requires you to do.<br />3. New question type is the biggest problem as you might have never seen it and have zero experience with it.<br />Therefore, you have to do a lot of exercises to improve your solving and understanding abilities, also for you to experience different kinds of questions so that you would have similar ideas with similar questions in the exam.<br /><br />It would be a hard time for you a few days before the exam, as you would do a lot of papers, exercises and questions. Most of the time you would have brainstorm while solving those problems you don't understand and are not familiar with.<br /><br />And btw, I recommend taking COMP2711 in fall better than in spring. In spring, there will be keener competition and harder difficulty in exam papers",

This course is not friendly if you are careless (i am careless :(().<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Oh, I am back commenting on the final. The final exam has two parts, again. They focus on the second half of the material, from induction to graph. They tend to have questions that require knowledge of several areas (e.g. graph combined with probability and expectation etc), so we have to make quick reactions to them. The time is tight for me again, and for us there are a lot of scores regarding the graph theory, which surprised me a lot. The mean for the 2 parts of the final is 31/52, 23/46, so the exam is not pleasant at all. However, for hard questions, you should not just quit them. Just writing some random stuff that shows your understanding can give you unexpected partial points!! I didn't realize this since I was pretty nervous.",

The best thing is that they do not require us to join Zoom meeting for the quiz. But this does not mean the quiz would be too hard!<br /><br />The final exam was actually out of my expectation. I expect the paper would be very long, but it ends up with only 3 questions in each part. But this does not mean the final exam is very easy. If you are not careful enough you can still fail. Because of this, doing past papers are important to tackle these careless mistakes.",

I recommend Prof WANG's lectures if you're mathematically mature and would like to have exposure to more advanced content.<br /><br />The only thing I'd complain about was the difficulty gap between the content taught in class and the exams.

The exams this year required the synthesis and integration of multiple topics and there were quite a few &quot;intriguing&quot; questions that were totally out of my expectation.<br /><br />One question in the midterm asked us to combine the 2 logic statements given by the knight and the knave. Most of us habitually formulated the logic statement by using inference (&quot;→&quot;), which turned out to be wrong if we carefully thought about the truth table values. Another question asked us to give a proof that every natural number can be written as a unique product of an odd component and a non-negative integer power of 2 (in fact the question was written in a more sophisticated manner, combined with notations of sets, divisibility, etc). From what I've heard the median score for that question across the 2 lecture sections was 0. I believe the vast majority of us had no idea of what the heck that question was going on LMAO.<br /><br />The final was not easy either. &quot;Basic&quot; stuff included binomial distribution, structural induction (combined with GCDs), and the recursive definitions of the nCr function and the set of complete graphs. We also have a bunch of &quot;interesting&quot; questions such as the sequence formed by the number of ways the 3x1 tiles could be placed in a 3xn board and the proof of its recurrence relations, and another question on what values of m, n for a bipartite graph to be a Euler path but not a Euler circuit. No more mechanical mathematical induction. No more mechanical proof of recurrence relations. All these were implicitly packed into another interesting and deadly questions. Have fun and get wrecked in the final exam.<br /><br />I got slightly above mean in the midterm, +1.14 SD above mean in the final and averaged 90-ish in the quizzes.

Also, it's the best 75% of polls so even if you get some wrong you have 10% guaranteed already. <br /><br />The written homework can be a bit difficult, but not crazy difficult. I like to compare answers with some students before submitting just to avoid silly mistakes. Mean is usually pretty high but it goes down each homework. They take your best 5 out of 6 scores.<br /><br />The midterm and finals are alright. Definitely not easy, but not crazy hard if you revise properly and do a lot of practice questions<br /><br />I was somewhere in the 80s% in my overall result and I got an A so I am satisfied.",

I really enjoyed attending lectures and I think this was the only course in Fall for which I had 100% attendance. <br /><br />Also happened to be a common core; it was a pleasure to have had the chance to nominate Kenneth for the Teaching Excellence Award.<br /><br />This might not be the case for all semesters but Kenneth created a telegram group which became insanely active ~2 weeks before the finals due to people discussing questions back and forth. Although I have to say performance in the final exam hugely depends on the amount of personal studying and past paper practice you do, the community this group provided definitely helped clear some things like some algorithm questions.<br /><br />Kenneth also gamified practice for the final exam. He went out of his way to create a website where students can create their own problems and exchange them with other students' (1 problem you create for 20 problems by other students). I only did 2-3 problems but due to the ample background most students taking this course had, they really aided my revision and also served as fun challenges!<br /><br />Definitely take this course even if you're not a CS student :)",

There are mainly 4 topics covered in the semester:<br /><br />- Counting<br />- Proofs, Induction and Recursion<br />- Probability <br />- Cryptography and Number Theory<br /><br />The content is quite interesting, like how encryption works (e.g. https SSL sometimes uses RSA to establish a connection) and probability (e.g. the expected no. of tickets we have to buy to win a mark 6). The techniques are useful for future algorithm course like COMP 3711. I believe the inequality version of the master theorem can be proved using the advanced induction technique taught in class, but I did not have the time to do so during my revision period. I did try to expand the general form T(n) = a*T(n/b)+g(n) recurrence (w/ the techniques taught in class) and compared the result with the master theorem. <br /><br />The topics are not difficult and the course materials suffice for a suitable amount of understanding.

A little downside is, the learning atmosphere of the class is not that good and Kenneth only sticks with the course materials. It would better if he can arise our interest to the topic by giving more real-life examples or further readings.<br />(Sorry for giving a B. I wish to give an A but my grading scheme is not as lenient as Kenneth's :P)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The TAs explain the pool question quite well, especially Abishek.

You can get full scores in quizzes, midterm and exam as long as you pay attention to the lecture, and most importantly, BEING CAREFUL. The questions in the assessments are extremely similar to the in-class exercises or the pool questions given. You don't even have to think about the solution. <br /><br />If you aim for an easy B range, or you are a careful person, this course is definitely a good one. Otherwise, consider taking other sections or even H-course, those would better reflect your ability in terms of grades. <br /><br />All score statistics are publicly available. Sorry for not attaching them here as USTSPACE does not support uploading HTML.<br /><br />My score:<br />Quiz 1: 3/3 (Mean: 2.553, SD: 0.597)<br />Quiz 2: 3/3 (Mean: 2.681, SD: 0.410)<br />Quiz subtotal: 10/10<br />Game 1: 5/5 (Mean: 4.725, SD: 0.760)<br />Game 2: 5/5 (Mean: 4.641, SD: 1.153)<br />Game subtotal: 10/10<br />Participation: 10/10<br />Midterm: 88/100 (Mean: 78.05, SD: 17.81) =&gt; 26.4/30<br />Final: 88/100 (Mean: 81.12, SD: 17.02) =&gt; 35.2/40<br />Overall: 91.6/100 =&gt; B+<br /><br />I misread &quot;or&quot; as &quot;and&quot; losing 8 points in the midterm. Then, I misread &quot;distinguishable&quot; as &quot;indistinguishable&quot; losing 12 points in the final. I understand it is my own fault for not being careful, but what is the point if everybody knows how to do the problems and grades are distributed purely according to carefulness?<br /><br />I thought I would get a B as I am only in about the 40 percentile in both midterm and final. Thanks to Kenneth's lenient grading scheme, it turns out to be a B+.<br /><br />Note: The exam papers are different for different sections in 2019 Fall. This may be changed in the future.",

There are only 2 quizzes instead of biweekly/weekly quizzes. There is an extra component which is the gamification platform. You have to answer 5 questions and post 1 question for each round. But there are only 2 rounds. <br /><br />The quizzes, midterm and exam are extremely easy which you don't have to put extra time for revision (although I did put quite a lot of time, the effort did not pay off). Attend every lesson, complete all in-class exercise (treat it as revision, not for participation score, 12 lectures give you full participation), then you are good to go.",

Almost everyone can get full in HWs and IPRS, what really determines your grade is the final exam and the quizes, which are quite easy. So carefulness become so important. I made 2 extremely stupid mistake in the final exam and in the 2nd quiz, losing about 3.%something out of the overall.

If I need to arrange them by increasing difficulty, it should be like this:<br />Algorithm&lt;logic&lt;Set and functions~Number theory.<br /><br />Algorithm: basically just intro to algo, you just need to apply some knowledge from 1014, e.g. n!&gt;n^2<br />Logic: just manipulating logical gates and inference questions<br />Set and functions: the questions to prove sets are countable/uncountable or having bijections are hard, you cannot practise a method to do the questions like the above 2 topics, you need to build up a mindset to do so.<br />Number theory: gcd and crypto, crypto questions could be practised, gcd questions could vary a bit and sometimes hard to deal with<br /><br />Second half (after midterm):<br />Induction and recursion<br />Counting<br />Probability <br />Graphs<br /><br />As a M1 students, the second half are easier to handle, especially counting and probability, difficulty is as follows:<br />Probability&lt;Counting&lt;Graphs&lt;Induction and recursion<br /><br />Probability and counting: mostly M1 stuffs with some new concepts, pigeonhole principle, derangement, but not really hard<br />Graphs: mostly definitions and questions are quite standard<br />Induction and recursion: personally think they are related but their difficulty should be ranked differently, recursion questions are much more harder than induction.<br /><br />To all hkers:<br />You might think that my background is quite impressive but bear in mind there are lots of nds who have encountered most topics in high school. I am not particularly talented in maths but there are lots of resources for you to practise and you should try your best to finish them in the following order:<br /><br />1. Past papers<br />2.

            "comment_content": "The course content is about various topics in discrete mathematics in computer science. In other words, those problems that could not be solved directly by computers, but are essential in computer science. Actual topics include logic, proofs, combinatorics, number theory, modular arithmetic, probability, recursion, induction, graph theory and some other things. As you can see, the problem is that there are way too much topics for one course. As a result, each topics is very briefly covered, and a lot of more interesting stuff is removed. Also, since the pace is quite fast, you are recommended to have some prior knowledge or read some materials before the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "As I mentioned, the course is mainly about prior knowledge and self learning, so there is actually no need to attend the lectures (the lecturer said that himself, I modified a bit). However, if you have free time, going to the lectures are quite fun. Prof. Wang explains things in a clear manner, and he mentions different interesting stories about each topic.<br />For the tutorials, it is basically about doing quizzes and checking answers. There is not much teaching, soo I do not have much to say.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is quite good. Basically, if you are good at mathematics (the thinking part, calculation is not important), you can get A range quite easily, provided that you do the exams and quizzes carefully. Even if you make some careless mistakes, there are bonus questions to save you. The grading scheme is 20% quizzes, 30% midterm, 50% final (each bonus is 2%, each bonus is either 0 or 100). Some statistics are provided below:<br />Quiz 1: Mean:80.6/100 <br />Quiz 2: Mean:83.8/100 Bonus 1: Mean:3.2/100 <br />Quiz 3: Mean:91.9/100 <br />Quiz 4: Mean:79.2/100 Bonus 2: Mean:32.6/100<br />Quiz 5: Mean:76.2/100 Bonus 3: Mean:9.8/100<br />(Highest four out of five quizzes are counted in final grade)<br />Midterm: Out of 60, the mean is 36, and the first, second, and third quartiles are respectively 29, 34, and 46.<br />Final: Out of a total score of 81, the first quartile is 65, the median is 44, and the third quartile is 33.<br />Me: Quiz average: 91/100 Bonus: 2 out of 3 Mid: 60/60 Final: 78/81 Grade: A+<br />It is good to see that the A+ grade is attainable here.",

The only actual workload is that I need to attend five quizzes.
