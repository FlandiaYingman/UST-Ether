Though most examples and concepts he mentions appear in the PPT posted before classes, his writing on board helps me build a clear framework and see links between different points. He also shows detailed computation and proof which is a great help to understand how the concepts work and remember them firmly. Examples shown via Jupyter Notebook aids intuitive understanding and can help you with the multiple choices in exams. He also encourages questions and interaction in class. It was noteworthy that listening to Bert's speaking English is enjoyable ;p<br /><br />Instruction assistant Zhang Xuning is one of the best TAs I met. She is kind and ready to answer questions. The tutorials are also worth to attend because she tends to mention some useful techniques that aids the computation or common errors that may ease the pain of exams. Other TAs are also responsible and friendly.",

Each homework has aroud 6 computational questions and 1 coding problem to be done via Jupytor Notebook which can be time consuming but refering to step-by-step hints can help you handle it. Plus there are only four homework sets during the semester so I think the workload is fine. Both exams are close book exams but you are provided with detailed formula sheet and the exam questions are very similar to those in homework. Therefore if you have to be at least familiar with techniques and concepts used in homework to deal with exams.",
