It will introduce students to the political, social, economic, and cultural changes that took place during this period, and also places China firmly in context of world history. Students will engage both primary and secondary sources and are encouraged to ask pertinent questions with regards to how changes and continuities took place. The course will also look beyond the strict temporal confines of the late imperial period and examine how history has informed the contours of China today.",

As someone who is interested in economics, I guess it's pretty cool to look at history in this way. I don't think the topics are that disorganized as others commented, as each topics are interconnected in my opinion.",
            "comment_teaching": "Throughout the semester, I have read quite some papers written by Prof Lee, he is definitely an expertise in modern Chinese history research. Yet he has a great room for improvement as a lecturer. His teaching is lack of enthusiasm, which he just read the ppt word by word, and his attempts of student interactions were minimal. I wonder if it was because of his attitude, or it was just his unproficiency in English that limited his teaching.<br /><br />To be fair, if a student read the readings in advance of the lecture, his lecture might not be as boring, or more questions could be raised from the student to start some meaningful discussions. Nevertheless, each reading are at least 20 pages long, and difficult to read for non History students, I don't think anyone would actually have the time to read the readings each week.",
            "comment_grading": "- Slightly below mean in midterm<br />- Probably didn't do that well in project (One potential freerider, and some groupmates were simply too busy to deliver quality work)<br />- Above mean in final exam<br /><br />Got B, as average as possible, I think this course is actually competitive, as the highest and minimum score differences were low according to Prof.",
            "comment_workload": "It's reasonable in my opinion, maybe a B+<br /><br />A midterm, a final exam, and a project. No weekly homework, that's it.<br /><br />But in every lecture, you better screenshot Prof Lee's ppt, as he would not share it on Canvas.<br /><br />Readings are useful and essential for better grades imo, but you don't have to read every single word on the reading, just skim through it until you feel that you've come across something important. So I completed a half semester worth of readings within 2 days for my final exam study.<br /><br />The project is not that great of a deal, unless there's a freerider in your group.",

The prof will talk and refer back and forth in between dynasties instead of focusing one dynasty for one teaching session. <br />A good thing though is that the course offers unique perspectives to Chinese history, like the occurrence of dragons and its association with the legitimacy of the emperor, for example.",
