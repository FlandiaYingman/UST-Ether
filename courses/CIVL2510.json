            "comment_teaching": "我對Prof Louati (負責Part 1) 的教學無乜太大意見, 佢有時會做吓啲小型experiment, 你有問題佢就會答。<br />至於Mohamed (負責Part 2) 就相對「有趣」, 佢係我見過對教學最有熱誠嘅人。 佢會親自指揮、親自部署tutorial, 亦非常願意解答學生嘅疑問, 但我認為唔少人到後期因為content的一塌糊塗與複雜程度而連問咩問題都諗唔到。我覺得佢今個sem嘅表現絕對係災難性。首先, 今個sem因為肺炎變咗做online class, 但個cameraman經常跟唔切Mohamed, 令到我地成日都miss咗啲內容, 更難清楚Mohamed喺到做緊乜。第二, Mohamed教啲內容極度困難, lecture會用嚟prove equations, 一般人未必可以知佢嘅intuition, 淨係知有呢條equation, 但唔識點用。後期啲example嘅難度同proof相若, 加上你唔會明lecture啲concept同被迫用Mohamed嘅獨門方法解題, 就算你想理解都幾艱辛。第三, Mohamed嘅教學速度令人無所適從, 喺啲容易嘅topic如Ch 3就用咗唔少時間, 搞到後面啲困難topics講得好匆忙, 學生根本跟唔上。<br />最後學Winnie the pooh話齋: 沒有風狂雨驟, 那就不是Fluid Mechanics了!",

            "comment_workload": "呢個course要做嘅嘢比2120, 2170同2410加埋仲多, 有5份compulsory assignments, 1份optional。<br />啲assignment單靠自己冇可能做哂, 雖然Mohamed會喺tutorial畀instruction你話點做, 你亦可以問佢問題, 但啲指示喺你做到後幾份已經無咩作用, 因為你根本冇可能諗到點做。Google/Chegg都唔會幫到你手, 因為你一定要用Mohamed個特殊方法做。<br />你亦可以睇吓assignment啲solution同past paper, 縱使你唔會完全明白, 亦對你準備Final近乎冇幫助。<br /><br />另外, 今個sem仲有一份極離奇嘅independent learning report, 要自己睇一篇關於fluid statics嘅book chapter, 然後寫一個report出嚟, 內容要包含book chapter嘅summary同與lecture中教的concept的關係。Guidelines係一堆 'Comment...', 我都唔知佢想要乜, 唯有草草了事。<br />總而言之, 呢個course physically要做嘅嘢係C, 但做一堆唔知自己做緊乜嘅嘢嘅心理負擔係好沉重同好辛苦。",

His teaching was quite interactive and he loved to use experiments (balloon, water tank) to demonstrate the behavior of fluid. Your lecture experience would be better if you sit in the front row. <br /><br />✅ LOUATI gave us extra exercises in each topics that may be helpful for preparing the quiz and midterm. <br /><br />❌ LOUATI finalized his lecture notes very late. It may be inconvenience for self-learners which heavily rely on reading lecture notes on their own.<br /><br />✅ For the second part, Prof. LAM is a visiting professor from HKU. He also taught Fluid Mechanics in HKU for many years. Therefore, his lecture notes and power point were well-established and very clear. <br /><br />✅ His teaching style was so easy going and understandable, what he said in lecture may not be difficult for you to understand, and he liked to relate the topics to engineering application by showing the engineering works around the world. <br /><br />✅ LAM's problem sets and solutions are well sat.<br /><br />❌ His pace and intonation was quite flat and slow, so i usually felt asleep in his 9am lecture. <br /><br />✅ Both instructors conducted the tutorials by themselves. When Prof. LOUATI handover the class to Prof. LAM, a special tutorial conducted by a TA demonstrated some multivariate calculus from MATH2011, which were some rigorous approach for control volume and continuity.",

Because it is not an ordinary civil course in nature. I would say it is a maths course which is about the derivation of equations rather than a civil course which is about the application of equations. Prof spent most of the lecture time deriving lots of equations with bulks of assumptions (but we never know how they are from). However, he seldom/ never teaches us how to apply the equations in the engineering field. As a consequence, we learn nothing from the course: neither the derivation of equations nor the application of equations. We will possibly become engineers instead of mathematicians in the future. Could you please stop deriving equations all the time?<br /><br />They always ask us to raise questions, but we have no idea what is going on.

            "comment_content": "This course can be divided into 2 parts: one before the midterm exam, and one after.<br /><br />1st part (Prof LOUATI): <br />Fluid statics was introduced, as well as some basic technical terms. Prof LOUATI put appreciable weights on the concepts, assumptions or required conditions for some formulae. There were some &quot;exercises&quot; in the lecture notes and these would be tested in the 1st closed-book test. <br /><br />2nd part (Prof LAM):<br />Fluid dynamics was introduced, including Bernoulli's equation and integral momentum equation. Some may think fluid mechanics is a difficult topic and personally I agree with that. I would say the major difficulty is understanding the maths (integrations and differentiations) behind. Yet, in this course, these did not appear much, only in lectures. Basically, you can avoid all integrations / differentiations in exams and tests to get a satisfying performance except the 1st test (10 out of 100 marks for a proof of a formula). But if you really want to learn more to ensure those knowledge introduced in the lectures can be used to deal with real-life problems, in my point of view, you had better work outside classroom to understand more (the assumptions, conditions, maths behind, etc) and practice the maths. Those tested in the course seems just elementary.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof LOUATI:<br /><br />He was a passionate and patient professor. He tried his best to explain the concepts in each topic. He often performed some experiments in class and one of them was chosen to be the midterm exam question. Those experiments induced students to think more about the reason for the occurrence of some interesting phenomena. He was willing to answer all questions (I sent him questions via email).<br /><br />Prof LAM:<br /><br />Prof LAM always gave videos about some interesting phenomena. However, one minor thing should be his accent. Also, he was a &quot;responsible&quot; teacher. He just taught in the lectures and students' questions raised just after lectures were not answered in details.",

(TA replied that I &quot;got more than 70% which is quite higher than the mean&quot;)<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />Analyzing the data, I was not one of the top students in each task (5-10 marks below the highest score obtained) but I got an A+ in the end.

It was promised that some of these questions would form the major part of closed-book tests so everyone was supposed to have been working hard on all of the questions included in the problem sets before each test. <br /><br />The workload for the 1st test is actually dependent on what grade you aim since prof LOUATI emphasized concepts but most of the problems in the problem sets were basically calculations. Therefore, if you want to ensure you can get some marks, make sure you work on all problems and those &quot;exercises&quot; in the lecture notes. If you want to ensure an excellent performance, try to apply the knowledge learnt in the lectures on some special fluid phenomena. <br /><br />The 2nd test was easy in calculation problems. The majority was identical to the problems in the problem sets except 1 calculation problem, which was from the textbook and I think most of us cannot complete that. <br /><br />Also, there was one section about some basic concepts and we just needed to answer in short sentences and it might just contribute 20% of the total score (5-10 questions only).<br /><br />As mentioned, any printed documents were allowed to be brought into the exam venue.
