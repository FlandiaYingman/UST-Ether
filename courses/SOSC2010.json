        "description": "Society and the environment are closely linked. In this course, we will explore these linkages at various levels from the local to the global. We will examine two sides of human and environment interaction: the important contributions that sociology can make to the study of natural resources and the environment, and important impacts that environment and natural resources have on social life, and vice versa. We will examine various types of production and consumption, materialism, population and development, and natural resource extraction, critical questions about sustainable use, capitalism, and the relationship between our patterns of recourse use and the quality of life in our communities and the world. Throughout the course, we will consider several dimensions of sustainable living including: the social, the ecological, the cultural, the economic and social and environmental justice.",
