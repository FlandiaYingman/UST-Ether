        "description": "This course will examine demographic aspects of population aging, patterns of mortality and health in human populations, as well as methods for analyzing and understanding those patterns. The primary focus will be on demographic causes of population aging, rooted in declining fertility and mortality, with particular emphasis on issues surrounding mortality, such as patterns of adult and old age mortality and health, the question of limits to length of life, the reliability of mortality data for older ages, problems in forecasting mortality at older ages, and on biological processes of aging.",
