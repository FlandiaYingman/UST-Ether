            "comment_teaching": "The prof is good indeed, but the book seems to be more useful since there is a lot of knowledge in the quiz that prof. will not mention in class or ppt because of the time limitation. So the teaching actually doesn't really matter. You can simply just read the whole book. I called this blended learning which I really do not like.",

You need to learn Processing (Java) coding in the first few weeks. Despite the 2 hour lecture. Labs will take around 3 + 2 hours and 2 hours left per week for reading books.",
