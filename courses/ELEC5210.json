            "comment_content": "In this course, we study two important topics: (1) magnetic materials and devices, (2) quantum information algorithms, devices, and systems.<br /><br />For topic (1), we learn about the application of magnetic materials and devices, what is magnetism, typical magnetic materials, magneto-electrical and magneto-optical properties, magnetic memory and beyond.<br /><br />For topic (2), it will emphasize on application of quantum information technology, examples of quantum algorithms, quantum devices (superconducting qubits), and quantum systems.<br /><br />The lecture schedule roughly looks like this:<br /><br />Topic 1: introduction to spin electronics and quantum information technology<br />Topic 2: magnetism and magnetic materials<br />Topic 3: magneto-electrical and magneto-optical properties<br />Topic 4: magneto-resistive random-access memory and beyond<br />Topic 5: basics for quantum information technology<br />Topic 6: quantum circuits and algorithms<br />Topic 7: physical realization of qubit<br />Topic 8: circuit quantum electrodynamics and qubit readout<br />Topic 9: qubit manipulation and dynamics<br />Topic 10: quantum error correction",
            "comment_teaching": "Excellent powerpoint slides, but some points are not written so you need to take notes too. Prof also gives regular in-class polling to make sure we can catch up with the materials. He also allocates weekly office hours for students to ask.",
            "comment_grading": "- Attendance: 1 pt for each class (counted by in-class polling)<br />- Weekly hands-on homework: 10 pts maximum for each one*<br />- Peer review report: 1 pt for each review report.*<br />- Midterm spintronics project (25 pt)<br />- Final quantum information science project (25 pt)<br />- Oral presentation, choose either midterm or final (10 pt)<br /><br />* most students did it once, can be more.<br /><br />Prof claimed as long as we reached total of 50+ points, we will get A range.",
            "comment_workload": "This course has one three-hour lecture every week, just like other PG courses.<br /><br />The workload is not that hard, since we can choose any topics we want for the projects as long as they are related to spintronics or quantum computing.",
