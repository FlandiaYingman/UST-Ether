Case and related questions would be given in advance. After you hand in the first one (around add-drop period), you would already need to start another case study immediately if you want to have more time to prepare and discuss it with your groupmates.<br />After that, you would need to start the term project. You can decide your own topic which is very flexible and hand in the project proposal. You can do the whole project on your own pace as prof does not require any updates or intermediate report. Initially, prof required us to do the presentation in class at the end of the semester, but she changed it to at most 20min presentation video. You also need to hand in 10-25 pages final report after the final exam. <br />For the final exam, it is open-book and 2 hours long which is not enough to complete the whole exam. It has 2 parts that require you to explain some concepts and do the calculations. It is super long and has almost 20 questions. The questions about concepts are easy but require a lot of time for you to write down the answers on paper. For the calculation, some of them are easy and just need to follow the example on powerpoint and substitute correct value given by the questions, although it still requires a lot of time for you to copy the format and write down the formula. The last few questions are difficult so you should spare more time to complete them.",
