            "comment_content": "Very very difficult course with a lot of content to remember. That being said, the content is extremely useful for those wanting to pursue a career in finance or risk management. Problem is there is only one exam which tests everything you've learnt from the beginning to the end, so comprehending all the content is very difficult since it is quite complex.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor does a competent job in teaching, however most of the time she is just reading off a script which is very evident and her English is sometimes difficult to understand because of that. The TA is absolutely horrible as it's very difficult to understand a word he is saying. Another problem is the professor will not reply to any email sent to her and you need to contact the TA of you have any questions, which kind of sucks since his English is very difficult to understand, which in turns makes it difficult to understand the content.",
            "comment_grading": "The mean for this course tends to be quite high usually, but the TA made several mistakes in terms of the grading for some of the questions. Also, they are very reluctant to change marks and the questions are very deceving. For example, in one of the assignments, I was marked wrong for one question because it was missing a few extra words to make that statement completely true. However, another question which came up in the exam was also missing a few words to make that statement completely true, and so I didn't select it, but that turned out to be the correct answer. I tried arguing with the TA and even the professor, but they refused to change the answer for that question. Horrible grading system for this course.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload isn't a lot considering the amount of content there is to cover. There are 3 assignments (2 group assignments based on coding and 1 individual assignment which has 5 mcq questions about certain topics). So when forming groups, make sure you find teammates who are good at coding if you aren't. Other than that, there is only the final exam and the fact that you have to attend 80% of the lectures to pass.",

She explains everything clearly in class and tries to link with real-life practice as well. She is very nice and approachable so do not hesitate to ask her questions. <br /><br />For me, the content of the lecture is tooooooo technical and statistical. I find it hard to catch up and compete with my peers. <br /><br />Tutorials are carried out by TA. TA will explain the codes used in PPT in Jupyter notebook (Python). Some practice questions are given before mid-term and final exams, only if you come to those sessions. <br /><br />Homework pretty hard but as long as you have some background in coding (familiar with python) and follow all the tutorials, you will be fine.

            "comment_content": "Theoretically, the content of this course includes the following:<br /><br />- An introduction to what a financial market is and the generic types of risks;<br />- Stocks (returns, volatility) and portfolios;<br />- Market portfolio and CAPM;<br />- Options and hedging;<br />- Value at risk (VaR) and extreme value distribution theory;<br />- Bayesian statistics and computation (using MCMC method) used for finding the credible intervals for key parameters.<br /><br />If you have never attended her (i.e. Kris Pan's) classes, the above list sounds kind of technical and compact, the only problem being a bit too ambitious and messy. However, let me show you what she actually taught:<br /><br />- A lot of concepts as mentioned above;<br />- How to plug in values to the formulas she copied to her slides. Besides, as far as I believe, the slides are very likely to be something prepared by the TA.<br /><br />That's it. No (even semi-rigorous) reasoning provided wherever necessary. Here are a few examples:<br /><br />- CAPM: a standard treatment would require the use or at least mentioning of Lagrange multiplier methods, but since RMBI program puts 2011 in Yr3 fall, it is fine not to mention and use the empirical method to plot out the return-volatility plots and show the efficient frontier. Now, at least you should tell us what Sharpe ratio represents and why the capital market line is important. She could have just drawn several lines and then everyone would be able to see why the tangential portfolio is special - but she did not. Now it comes to the security market line - again, a big formula there, and she also messed up the logic. Here is the details (you can ignore it now and come back to the following description here when she finishes teaching you CAPM). When getting from the asset return v.s. market return regression to the SML, you need to see the function as a function of beta instead of market return (i.e. change the main variable) and use the portfolios on the efficient frontier (the upper half of the minimal variance line) as well as the risk-free rate to find the two coefficients in the linear equation, but she did not show the flow of the above steps and directly jump to a conclusion. I bet 50%+ of the class got lost, and another 50%+ of the class who thought they get it got it wrong (they got a wrong idea/intuition of what is actually going on).<br />- Things get even worse when she talks about option pricing. She cannot even explain the binomial tree method clearly. Or more accurately, she didn't try to explain it clearly. And the presentation of Black-Scholes formula is done in the worst approach: just by inserting a big formula, which successfully confused everyone who wasn't familiar with it. <br />- She did not even introduce the concept of reversibility when describing MCMC and MH algorithm. Oh, my mistake - she did not even mention what is a stationary distribution.<br />- Posterior distribution for beta distribution (after updating), just a line of text, no derivation, no explanation. By the way, this short line of text describing the posterior distribution for beta distribution is tested in final.<br />- Checking convergence and consistency by looking at plots without knowing what is the meaning of &quot;convergence&quot; and &quot;consistency&quot;. You could randomly pick one student from the class and ask them what is the meaning of an estimator being consistent and they will find it hard to explain. This is NOT their fault - this is the lecturer's fault.<br />- Time series analysis. She literally finished this topic on Thursday, and then the next Tuesday (when the final took place), around 5 out of 30 questions related to this topic appeared in the exam. And by the way, why the hell are you teaching Yr2 students things related to stationary processes???<br /><br />Simply put, the course is like teaching you quantum group theory when you know neither quantum physics nor group theory.<br /><br />To the designer of this course, whoever they are: A crudely castrated version of the theory not only does NOT help students understand, but is also hazardous to real world modelling/applications and their further study in relevant topics. If you find that you are not able to pack up your contents well into modules to describe something clear enough and avoid causing confusion to your students, it is because you have a design problem and your course is probably lacking some important parts (e.g. the risk-neutral probability measure, where is it?), not always because &quot;this is how it is&quot; or &quot;I know it is hard, you need to study extra hard to understand&quot; (the later sentence was quoted from her class).<br /><br />Also, many claim the content of this course to be &quot;useful&quot;. Again, adjusting parameters of models might be seemingly useful, but remember the famous rule: garbage in, garbage out. She did not teach how to get garbage out of your input, nor to effectively see whether you get garbage in your output (she did say something about it, but that is far from enough).",
            "comment_teaching": "I cannot comment on something that does not even exist. If you think reading off from slides is a way of teaching, then I have to say her pausing and stressing will certainly obtain a C in LABU.<br /><br />But I have to make one thing clear: I am not judging her academic ability. There is a possibility that if she wishes to, she could be a very good teacher. Unfortunately that didn't happen in this semester.",
            "comment_grading": "This is an RMBI compulsory (required) course, so you might have to take it if you're in the program. As per my estimation, A range/B+ is kind of tricky to get, but if you want to secure B, you probably only need to get slightly above mean in final. My suggestion is prepare well for your other courses (such as FINA 2303, MATH 2421/31, COMP 2011/12/3211) and don't gamble on an A from this course - it is kind of risky to show hands for it.<br /><br />Now let's take a look at her grading scheme. 50% give away in total (40% assignments and 10% participation), and 50% final. The final is a 30 MCQ quiz. What does this imply? Making errors in your assignments can be really expensive (calculate the equivalence of 1 MCQ to how many marks in one assignment), and reducing the percentage of final does not help at all for reducing the correlation between the overall score and the final score.<br /><br />By the way, the 10% participation = 6% attendance + 4% survey, which is not anonymous. Try to take a guess why there are such two things in her grading scheme.",
            "comment_workload": "The assignments have no workload at all, and the final is relatively easy to revise for - just do all the practice questions and remember the bunch of mathematical rules she told you (again, most of these rules are described in words, not in mathematical terms. If you want to verify the statements in her final questions with even a basic sense of mathematical rigour - which was what I tried to do - you are risking yourself in the final, unless you are a real expert in statistics. Even if you self-learn many things and the reasoning behind that she did not teach, trying to do the questions especially the conceptual ones rigorously is still very risky). <br /><br />The major workload is that you have to pick up everything she &quot;taught&quot; in class by yourself. This could be entertaining and rewarding, but again, why shall we even attend the lessons and placing us on a position for her to judge if we could do a much better job in learning these materials by ourselves?",
