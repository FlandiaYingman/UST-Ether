(I mean it.) He did not book an extra room to accommodate all of us, and still insisted on having us all sitting in alternate seats. After wasting some time Melody/the TAs finally found an empty room to accommodate the rest of students. But still some of the students had to sit on the ground to do the exam... (WTF?)<br /><br />‚úÖ Melody's teaching is satisfactory, with overall clear explanation and elaboration.<br /><br />‚ùå It's, however, not a very participative style and at times her lectures become quite dull.",

Li Ning's part was MC questions, but they were certainly not easy. He only skimmed through the surface during lectures, but in the exams a much higher level of details were required. Don't believe him when he says he's gonna cover up to this or that in the exams... Melody's part is comprised of a few context-based questions on the principles of extraction, isolation and bioassays of a certain compound in plants. They were not easy either, and as a result most of us crashed the midterm exam.<br />Mean = 44.56%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD = 14.36%<br /><br />Due to the political situation in Hong Kong, the final exam became an online open-book one. 2 questions were asked in the exam - one on how to make a transgenic tomato with certain desirable traits, and another one on the application of 4C quantitative PTM proteomics to identify phosphosites of cold-treated crops. A logical layout of experimental design was required in our answers and I personally think the difficulty was quite reasonable.

            "comment_workload": "The major course workload lies on the tutorial presentation on a research paper. Each project group consisting of 5 students is required to critique a research paper related to a certain topic, and deliver a presentation on the paper to help other students review essential concepts mentioned in the lectures. I believe this would be the very first course for life sciences students to ever critique a research paper. For your information, websites such as PubMed provides a very good source of research papers.<br /><br />Attendance is not compulsory. But I believe it is impossible to understand the PowerPoint slides without listening to Li Ning's explanation in class.<br /><br />Just like other life sciences course, preparation a few days ahead of the exams is absolutely required. There is no way you can digest the materials in the last minutes.<br /><br />There used to be an innovative project in the past years, but it was cancelled this year due to a much larger enrollment than the past.",

            "comment_content": "The content is quite comprehensive, have taught you steps on how to do biotechnology (which could be applied in other biotech courses.) and the applications of different areas in plant biotech. <br /><br />Li Ning, talked on the theory and applications of plant biotechnology on various areas , e.g. flowers, fruits, cottons. <br /><br />Melody, taught more on the process of how to genetic engineer a plant, knowing which part you want to GM and the desired product biosynthetic pathway, isolate/extract the gene of interest, bioassay, culture of plant cells. <br /><br />Li Ning -<br />Chemical Inducible Promoter<br />Agrobacterium (use of Ti plasmid)<br />Herbicides <br />Cottons<br />Flowers<br />Ribozyme<br />Gene Silencing<br />Fruits<br />PTM-Proteomics<br /><br />Melody - <br />Medicinal Plant<br />Medicinal Algae<br />Identification, Extraction and Bioassay<br />Plant Cell Culture<br />Plant and Algae as Drug Factory",
            "comment_teaching": "Li Ning -<br />For me, his topics are much more difficult than Melody's part as you need to be really familiar and understand the theory behind the topics in order to answer his MC questions in the exams correctly. <br /><br />He tried to explain in class, however I think the depth of knowledge he explained&nbsp;&nbsp;is not enough for you to answer the exam. So extra effort is needed after class to digest and revise and even go on Google to search for the theories. <br /><br />Melody - <br />She explained very clear on her topics and asked questions to make sure you understand what she said.",

Li Ning said in the first few class that he would like to give all of us B+ or above. <br /><br />Honestly speaking, if you aim high, then you need much more extra effort and time to work on the materials.",

            "comment_content": "Content was quite interesting. Just as the course title is indicating, the course teaches about applying biological concepts to make real life plant products. <br /><br />Melody part was about extracting, cell culturing and bioassay. Just straightforward concepts Prof. Li Ning covers a variety of topics: cotton biotechnology, Agrobacterim mediated gene modification, herbicide, flower genetic engineering and so on. <br /><br />The course has midterm, final and two presentations. One presentation is just summarizing a paper that is related to the course topic. Not a hard one. <br />Second one is pretty interesting, both in a good way and in a bad way. It is called an innovative project, where you have to come up with a product that is commercially feasible. He focuses mainly on &quot;innovation&quot;, whether the idea is original. <br />Actually he gives grades generously (or hilariously)for the presentation, so i think the exam is still the key for the grade.",
            "comment_teaching": "Melody<br />She talks really fast and to be honest, not very good at explaining. She jumps to next sentence without finishing her last sentence. Her tone is high and bright, but monotonic: when she was asking question, it took everyone 30 seconds to realize that she was actually asking something. <br /><br />Li Ning<br /><br />Teaching is not bad, but after taking two course of his, i am pretty sure he forgets what he said. Never believe when he says it will only cover up till this, or this will be tested; it will never happen. You need to study every detail that is written on the powerpoint.",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm: 40<br />Presentation: 10<br />Innovative project: 10<br />Final: 40<br />Bonus +1 point if you ask question during tutorials, basically when somebody else is giving presentation. Not meaningful point as almost everyone gets it and I think it's maximum 1 bonus point. <br /><br />Following the curve for A range, but I think he is generous for B range. Final exam score was not released so not sure.",
            "comment_workload": "Not that much. Just be careful with LI ning's part, because when he is teaching, he only scratch the surface, but in real exam, it's all about details. Also, tutorial presentations could also come up in the final, but it was not that hard.",
