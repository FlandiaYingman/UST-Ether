        "description": "This is an upper-level course on the main components in political sociology. The course uses the book Power, State, and Society by W. Lawrence Neuman as the chief textbook. Key issues to be discussed include: the interplay between democracy, nationalism and the nation-state, political ideas and ideology, protests and movements, power and hegemony. Most empirical cases for applying the concepts/theories in political sociology are drawn from the major local and regional political and social events and tensions. Students are encouraged to use the analytical skills and historical perspectives learned from the course to grasp, among others, the most important realpolitik developments in and surrounding HK and the Chinese mainland.",
