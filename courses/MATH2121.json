Usually, he just explains (but more like reading) the materials in his notes without many extra examples. So I did not attend any lecture after the first few weeks of the semester.<br /><br />The good thing of this professor is he would return the exam paper really quick.<br /><br />About the TA, what I could say is: are you fxxkin' kidding me?

The only suggestion is to double-check the answers by substituting your answer into the formula in the question to test if it's correct, there should be sufficient time given to you in the midterm for you to do that.<br /><br />As the final format is changed to Webwork exam this semester, I don't think the final this semester can be used as a reference, but I would say that the final is way more difficult than the midterm because there are tons of difficult conceptual question that you must choose all of the correct statements or answers to score the mark. <br /><br />Actually My grade is satisfactory (MT mean+1sd, Final 6x(+5) which led to A) but I give a D to the grading because of the unclear method of calculating the final result for those whose encountered error in webwork final exam and the missing of C+ grade in the grading curve (which means that you would immediately get a C if you can't meet the cutoff of B-).",

Starting from some basic matrix manipulation and computaion to some more advanced concepts and algorithms and applications. It's suitable for anyone who has no Linear Algebra background.<br /><br />Not hard to follow, and not shallow in terms of depth of content.<br /><br />The following content schedule throughout the semester is quoted from Eric's public class homepage https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~emarberg/teaching/2021/Math2121/. You may also change the &quot;2021&quot; in the URL to &quot;2020&quot;/&quot;2019&quot;/&quot;2018&quot;/&quot;2017&quot;. Eric has a webpage for all these fall semesters that offers this course.

            "comment_teaching": "Eric has a double major from stanford and a PHD from MIT, so clearly he is a genuis. His understading about math is definately at a stage where he can just say something, and that sentence can be and should be memorized as a theory for us.<br /><br />This semester, due to the pandemic, they adopted mix-mode teaching. L1 is purely online and L2 is F2F. But whichever section you are enrolled in, you can always watch the recording posted on the public course website from L1 zoom recording.<br /><br />Personally, I would say, it's better to watch his lectures online instead of attending the class F2F. Because:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Generally speaking, his pace of voice is rather slow. And it's just so easy to get sleepy when listening to his voice. 1.5xx speed of zoom recording is a pefect speed for listening to his lectures. And as he is a native speaker of English, 1.5xx doesn't make his voice unclear. It's just the right speed I think.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Someone in a prvious review said his lectures are like some very decent Youtube videos without a Pause Button. I can't agree more on that. But when you watch Zoom recording, there is a pause button. You can pause and write down something he said that can be and should be memorized as a theory for us. (which happens quite often for me) <br /><br />Generally, his teaches by following the lecture notes (i.e. making annotations whlie explaing, giving examples from time to time, and give some verbal &quot;Eric's theory&quot;) He also uses Julia to do some demo during the lecture to help us visualize and understand some concepts or have a look at some applications of certain content covered in the lecture. They won't be covered in exams but they sometimes do promt better visualization and understading. The Youtube Link I put in the Workload Section may help as well.<br /><br />Overall the teaching is good. Especially the &quot;Eric's theory&quot; part.<br /><br />Eric also set up a discord server for the whole class, where you can ask questions (either about homeworks, logistics, grading cutoffs, etc.) And his reply is rather quick.

But the final was somewhat similar to past years in terms of difficulty.<br /><br />Here's what Eric said after the midterm: <br />&quot;Approximate letter grade cutoffs in terms of the midterm score are as follows :<br />A: above 52<br />B: between 36 and 52<br />C: between 20 and 35&quot;<br /><br />So you can see that he assigns A range for [mean+1sd,inf), B range for [mean,mean+1sd), C range for [mean-1sd, mean) .etc. So the grading is obviously very lenient, as you can get A range only by achieving mean+1sd in exams. You might only get B range in many other Math and Comp courses. <br /><br />My grades for reference:<br />Homework: full;<br />Midterm: 65/80;<br />Final: 115/120;<br />grade: A+",
            "comment_workload": "Just like most math courses in UST, and unlike most COMP and ELEC couses, the workload is quite small. Just One HW per week and review for the exams. That's it. <br /><br />However, just as eric said: &quot;The graded homework assignments are only a bare minimum of preparation for keeping up with the course.&quot; . And also, I think recent years Eric is starting to emphasise more and more understanding in exams, instead of just simple and rigid computations like in 2017 and 2018. So I highly recommand this Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab The youtube videos provided by 3blue1brown are some really high quality shit, and it really helps you visualize and understand concepts of linear transformations, eigenvector and eigenvalues, determinants, etc.",

            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Li is an excellent mathematician. In terms of linear algebra, he definitely possesses much knowledge. He is able to present every proof smooth and explain them well. However, sometimes he will become so excited and go beyond the syllabus. The major problem of him is that his voice is way too soft. It is not that easy to listen to his words.<br /><br />He gave a review of the last lecture every time. This made us easier to follow. However, this also made the lecture became very tedious as you would feel like every time the content is the same. To some extent, this is the problem of the content as well. It seems like most things are very alike but just change of the terms.<br /><br />Prof. Li use whiteboard all the time while not all of his writing can be found in lecture notes. As a result, I recommend you to jot down everything on the whiteboard. It can help you understand the proof as the steps from Prof. Li are clearer than lecture notes.<br /><br />One weird thing is that in the lecture the professor will focus on proof and give you some very difficult examples. However, assignment and exams focus on computation instead and super easy. My recommendation is to try to understand the proof in lecture. If you really cannot follow, do not give up. You can still score high by just knowing the computation methods and basic concepts.",

You must complete any two (correct solutions not necessarily required), while the other eight can be done for extra credit. Complete all eight extra HW questions every week for 5% extra credit. <br />Disclaimer: These are HARD, especially towards the end. Much more difficult than the course textbook questions. See for yourself at the course website. Expect to spend upwards of six hours if you wish to complete all ten questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Midterm: was easy. <br /><br />Final: Significantly more difficult than midterm, though not quite on par with offline HW difficulty .You will need to do extra work to get a good grade.

            "comment_teaching": "We all be in UST long enough to know UST has no real good professor.<br /><br />Prof. Chang is an average one. His words are fairly understandable, and as a person he is quite funny. I like his sense of humor; he sometime tells some funny math jokes.<br /><br />He tended to write a lot on the broad and use some unnecessarily large examples. The lecture are mostly focused on proofs, especially the second part of the course (i.e. after midterm), so the lectures can get fairly dense. Once you get lost, it is unlikely that you will be back on track again on that day's lecture. Though, for people who are interested in pure math, I guess the rigorous maths&nbsp;&nbsp;might be able to provide some insights.<br /><br />For Prof. Chang alone, I will give a B~B- for teaching. But what's really the problem is the TA.<br /><br />I only went to the tutorial twice, and I never understood a single words from the TA.",

It consist of a series of free response questions, along with a few T/F and MC (with multiple answers) asking for concepts. No proof was on the exam.<br /><br />Personally my biggest problem in that final is only time, but even though I left like one whole page blank (I left out one part on each problem), I still ended up with an A-.",
