        "description": "The course aims to study some actuarial models and their applications in derivative pricing and financial risk management. Topics include introduction to various derivatives such as forward, futures, European/ American options, exotic options and interest rate derivatives, uses of various options strategies in portfolio management, pricing options using binomial tree model, Black Scholes formula for options pricing and its extension, Options Greeks and their applications in hedging, use of Monte Carlo simulation in options pricing, pricing of interest rate derivatives using the Black-Derman-Toy tree. The course also prepares students to take the Exam MFE (Models for Financial Economics) of the Society of Actuaries.",

            "comment_content": "In the first part of this course, we first explore various financial derivatives (forward contract, future contract,options etc.) that are commonly traded in financial market and examine their role in investment/risk management. Next, we examine basic principle (known as no arbitrage pricing principle) for pricing these derivatives. In the second part of this course, we develop several mathematical models for pricing some complex derivatives. For this semester, binomial tree pricing model (discrete-time model) and the famous Black-Scholes model (continuous time model) is covered. Besides the standard no arbitrage pricing principle, we also develop an equivalent pricing approach (known as risk neutral valuation principle) which provides a shortcut in pricing derivatives. If time permits, we also examine some computational algorithm (lattice tree approximation method, Monte-Carlo simulation)that are useful in derivative pricing but these part are not examined. Overall, this course covers the second part of syllabus covered in the Exam IFM(Investment and Financial Market, Items 6-10) of the Society of Actuaries.",
            "comment_teaching": "LCM is pretty passionate about teaching and he is teaching four UG courses this semester including both lectures and tutorials, not to mention that one of those is actually a completely new course which means he even needs to edit the lecture notes while teaching the course. Really appreciate his efforts on teaching and i'd suggest you attend every lecture since you'll definitely learn something from his course as long as you put in some efforts.",
            "comment_grading": "The course applies absolute grading, but the actual outcome could be adjusted depending on the performance of students.<br />For this semester,<br />Assessment 20% + Bonus<br />Take-home midterm Examination 20%<br />Take-home final Examination 60%<br /><br />I got about 65% ending up with a B, quite fair i would say.",
            "comment_workload": "There is one assignment for each chapter and usually there would be 4 required problems and 2 or 3 bonus problems which are really important since it helps top up your final grade so do try to solve those bonus questions, if you encounters any difficulties, just ask LCM for some hints.",
