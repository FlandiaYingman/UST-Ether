        "description": "The primary target of this course is to study compact Riemann surfaces. We begin with the basic setting of complex manifolds, their tangent spaces and differential forms. Then we introduce the language of sheaves, germs and sheaf cohomology so that we can finally derive the important Riemann-Roch theorem. Students have to seek approval from the instructor to take this course.",
