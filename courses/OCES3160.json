            "comment_content": "The course outline pdf is enclosed in this comment.<br /><br />It is preferred if you studied biology in high school, as some terminologies are explained/learnt beforehand. It might be challenging for people with no prior biology knowledge, as some terminology aren't as concisely explained and is skimmed over quickly.<br /><br />The course dabs on several ecology topics but doesn't dive too deep into them. Each ecology topic is covered in one lecture note, with an average of 20-35 pages each. Hence, it wouldn't be too difficult for people new to ecology to understand. The only issue would be the mixing up of information between various topics.<br /><br />The knowledge that will be tested isn't cumulative, so you don't have to stress about revising the same stuff from mid-term. <br /><br />The course description failed to mention that it was made for Science Year 3 Students (or maybe I'm just blind, oop-). This didn't impact me, as I handled the course pretty well.<br /><br />Please be reminded that my notes (enclosed in this comment) are just summaries of different topics based on my understanding. Some information might be excluded/not as detailed compared to the lecture notes as I've already learnt or memorized beforehand. I hope it can help anyone whose studying this course :&gt;",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Yau would slowly read off the powerpoints in each lecture. <br />She's a passionate teacher who sometimes shares her ecological experiences and cracks some jokes to liven up the classroom. She even showed us her potted plants once, to serve as an example of the relevant topic. In addition, she's very open to students asking her questions during lectures.",
            "comment_grading": "The exams are MC-based. They test your memorization (90%) and understanding (10%) of each topic. Most questions come from the lecture slides (not those you have to take pictures of). You don't have to remember everything word for word, as the answers don't differ much. If you aim high, you'll have to remember specific numbers and animals from each category, which appeared in several questions. Don't worry about forgetting specific mathematical models/formulas, they will be provided in exams without further explanation, so you'll still need to know what the alphabetical letters represent.<br /><br />The most challenging part is questions that test your understanding. Some are hinted at in lecture notes, so you have to pay close attention to detail. In mid-term, I struggled with 5 of those questions, while for my finals, I struggled with 7.<br /><br />Mid-term: 42/50 (50%)<br />Mean:36.1; Low:20.0; High 46.0<br />I started revising early on since the professor was uncertain about testing us with MCs and short questions. Also, I was never good at biology, so I was worried about not catching up.<br /><br />Finals: Not given (50%)<br />I started revising only a week before the exam. hence I didn't remember/understand as much during the finals.<br /><br />Overall, I got an A-.",
