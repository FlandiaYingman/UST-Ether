However, each part lacks in-depth discussion and clarification.<br /><br />Students are usually required to form a 2-people group at the beginning of semester and starts planning, and submit a final game with a video demo at the end of semester.<br /><br />WebGL, Three.js and physi.js are commonly used to illustrate the concept but they are not essential, which means they are not included in the final exam and not a fixed requirement in the game.<br /><br />A quick peek about the content (excluding the intro and overview):<br />1. Game Design<br />2. Introduction to Graphics<br />- most of them covered in COMP4411<br />3. Rendering &amp; WebGL Basics <br />(Light source, Phong illumination model, Texture mapping, Shading, etc)<br />4. Physics<br />(Physics simulation, Projectile, Explicit Euler Integration, collision detection, Quadtree/Octree, BSP Tree)<br />5. Networking<br />6.

It's better to approach him face-to-face.",

But there will still be a grading curve. It is normal to hear students getting 13/15 in final game but eventually getting B range or below as there are always some insane students making incredible game and raising the marking standard.<br /><br />Some statistic:<br />Exam (30%): 84/100.<br />Proposal (10%): 9/10.<br />Progress (10%): 10/10.<br />Final Game (50%): 15/15.<br />Final course score: 94.2/100.<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />Exam (30%): ~80/100<br />Proposal (10%): 10/10.<br />Progress (10%): 10/10.<br />Final Game (50%): ~12/15.<br />Final course score: ~84/100.<br />Grade: B",
            "comment_workload": "Depends on your DETERMINATION.<br /><br />The workload comes solely from the game project, with 3 presentations reporting your proposal, progress and final product.<br /><br />Note that the game project is done FROM SCRATCH. Marking is done based on playability and complexity. Pedro sees how much is done by YOUR CODE importantly. Comparing to using a strong game engine and a tons of libraries/templates, Pedro likes students applying the graphics algorithm and write challenging code themselves. In my semester I gave up Unity and adopted ThreeJS by writing literally EVERYTHING by myself and my beloved teammate, and the final grade is satisfying.<br /><br />Therefore, my advice is that your effort is directly proportional to your grade.",

            "comment_content": "This course is mainly about producing an end product ie your own fully working game.To do this, pedro teaches how to use webGL to create it, but you can choose to use any other game engine or platform to produce your game. If you decide not to use webGL, then the middle part of the semester becomes quite skippable, as it is all about how to use this software. I myself used UNITY to make my game. <br /><br />However, there are many interest topics included, such as AI, game physics, game design and graphics. Without going into too much detail of each section, pedro gives a good summary of each area as a teaser for doing the main courses later on. Its more than enough to do some practical game programming and whets your appetite for later.<br /><br />One downside is that if you focus on one aspect in your game, its difficult to use the lecture materials to do it. For example my game heavily relied on AI, so i had to do a lot of self study and learning to develop that part, as the course only covers it briefly.",
            "comment_teaching": "Pedro is a really good teacher, going through all the material in a sequential and methodical manner. The classes are clearly well planned, designed to be a supplement to your work on the game programming assignment. <br /><br />He is also extremely open to questions and really helps guide you in your project. I personally went to him multiple times to ask for help or guidance on particular game mechanics or potential game designs, and I felt that he both knew the material well and really knows how to explain it.",
            "comment_grading": "If you are a lover of practical programming, you will love&nbsp;&nbsp;this courses' grading. It is almost entirely composed of your game programming project, with only 30 odd % being a final exam. Pedro himself states in class that the exam is not that important, the main thing is the project. <br /><br />You will also be asked to present what you have done so far two times in the semester, but as long as you prepare few slides and talk clearly, you can get full marks easily for these sections. <br /><br />This is one of those courses where the number of hours you spend on it directly correlates with your grade, plus you don't need to worry much about exams as if you make a particularly good game, your final exam results don't matter, you can still get A range with poor final exam result.",
            "comment_workload": "I wish there was a varies workload option, as it really depends on how much you want to do. My group mate andI spent around 15 hours a week combined to produce our game, which got us full marks for the ~70% that was the programming project, and if you love to program and apply theory into practice, then the workload will feel quite light. <br /><br />However, if you are not very good/interested in programming and prefer courses with an exam and more theoretical assignments, then this course will be extremely challenging, as a lot of it is about self motivating yourself to create and push your own limits as a programmer.<br /><br />I have decided to put workload A because thats how it felt to me, but it will vary a lot depending on how much effort youw ant to put in. The end result will matter a lot more than the grade, as you have a chance to produce a really good piece of work to show potential employers etc.",

It is particularly exciting to share your progress and results with classmates, and have a look at others. You are encouraged to question others during the sharing session as well as answer the questions from your peers. Pretty like a game jam in some sense. <br />Depending on the platform, engine, and API you choose, the course offers a great opportunity to exercise your coding and game-design ability.

You may take a look at the course website to have a look at the slides. The important parts are AI, Graphics, and Physics, which have to be investigated to make your game work. Network and Sound are just the add-ons for most cases, especially when most of us are just starting game-makers.<br />You will get to work on a game project and make your own game with your teammate(s), where lots of stuff can be learnt by doing.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Pedro is a very nice guy, he has been very communicative and would like to give students all kinds of advice. Though the course material itself is a bit plain, he makes good explanation of things with enthusiasm most of the time. So fair teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is fair, taking in to account an exam and the whole project process, which gets graded in seperated parts.<br />First, the exam itself is just plain knowledge, study the course material, remember it is also important to your final grade, even if it is nothing comparable with the game project, in terms of both workload and difficulty.<br />Then, the project, there are altogether three phases:<br />1. You will first do a proposal, which is basically writings, make sure to include details, even if you may not be super clear about what you game will be like, leave blanks when you are really not sure, but graders are concerned with the level of detail you provide in this phase, so that they know you have put in some efforts in designing the game.<br />2. Then, it is the progress report.&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allowed for this part is around 1 month. Where you should have built the skeleton for your project, so that graders will know how your game functions and looks like as a prototype, it should be noted that graders want to have a holistic view of your game, so try to finish most of the basic AI, graphics, or physics!<br />3. Lastly, the final game, it is somewhat fierce competition, because most of us have the determination to make games, so try to present a both creative and good-looking(that means, in terms of the technical aspect of the game, like adding some advanced cg/AI/physics features, by yourself). It seems still possible to get good grade even if you are not the best.",
            "comment_workload": "Super heavy, start early with your teammate(s), do not wait for the course progress, since Pedro would most likely cover material without too many details, and you will need to do most of the research to make your code work by yourself.",
