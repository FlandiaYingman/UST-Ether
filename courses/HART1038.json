        "description": "Capturing a person’s face with a camera is easy but making a meaningful representation of that person through photography requires not only photographic techniques, but also the ability to communicate, understand and make insightful interpretation of one’s personality. In this course, students will acquaint themselves with the history and development of Portraiture in different art forms, learn to analyze portraits taken by master photographers, and acquire knowledge and skills necessary to make a good portrait through hand-on practices and photo editing workshops. Basic photography knowledge is preferred but not necessary.",

            "comment_content": "The course covers many aspects of photography with a main focus on the portraiture side, ranging from the history and masterpieces of portraiture, basic knowledge of camera, how to use the light and shadows, how to portrait someone in the camera, and some photo editing techniques using Photoshop. <br />Throughout the whole semester, the class was mainly divided into three modules: in-class teaching about the theories and basic knowledge; studio sessions where the professor will show you how to use the equipment and demonstrate the ways to shoot portraiture; presentation for your own work and a small discussion within the class.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor delivered concepts in a clear way and you can learn a lot from him. He is an open-minded person who welcomes different opinions and questions. During the studio sessions, he demonstrated the techniques in a detailed way and gave every one of us chances to try so that we can save more time when shooting photos by ourselves.",
            "comment_grading": "Attendance: 10%<br />Participation: 10%<br />Portrait of Sitter: 20%<br />Self Portrait: 20%<br />Individual Final Project: 40%<br />I would recommend you to participate actively in class because the professor values a lot on the communication and the exchange of ideas. The professor has a relatively strict grading scheme, although he might give positive feedback on your work, your score for each assignment may not be as high as you expect.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is a bit heavy given its 1 credit. For the total three projects, you should expect to spend a lot of time in the studio to get familiar with the equipment first and take good photos. The studio is usually fully booked so you'd better have more flexibility to choose the different sessions to shoot photos.<br />Another recommendation is that you'd better know some basic knowledge about how to operate your camera before taking this course so that you can have a relatively lighter workload.<br />Although the workload is a little heavy, you can learn a lot of things from this course if you are a real photography fan.",

Be prepared to be taken picture of as most of the times you'll be working with each other. <br /><br />Most of the lessons were hands-on with a couple of sit-in classes. I had a lot of fun in the class and meeting other students who are interested in photography.<br /><br />2 graded assignments (20%), final project (40%), participation (10%), attendance (10%).<br /><br />Knowing some photo editing will be an advantage for final project.",
            "comment_teaching": "He comments and suggests on everyone's work which can be beneficial at times. He shows some theories and examples that you can get inspiration from. You can always approach him during class if you have any concerns. <br /><br />He uses a Nikon DSLR, so if you are using other brands, you might want to familiarize yourself with the settings and calibration of your own camera as he might not be familiar with other brands.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading can be quite subjective on the teacher although he does emphasize that there is no preference or rule in photography.<br /><br />Invested a lot of thought and time into my work and managed to get an A range grade.",
            "comment_workload": "Studio time will be given and if you want to use it, your schedule has to be flexible. Timeframe for homework and projects are usually one week, and if you want a good grade, you need to put some time into it.",
