        "description": "Networks appear across modern life. Networks can influence the jobs people get, the products they buy, how they vote, and even who they end up dating. Networks are intimately related to the internet and internet commerce, ranging from how web pages are linked, to who follows who on instagram, to how viral marketers attempt to spread information about a product. Given how pervasive social and economic networks are to our lives it is important to understand which kind of networks are likely to appear (network formation) and how networks might influence behaviour (networks games). \nThis course will begin with an overview of how networks impact economic behaviour and then examine the empirical properties of networks that we see in the world. After that we move to discussing models of networks formation. Finally we will study how networks impact behaviour like the spread of disease, how individuals in society learn from one another, why some products succeed while others fail, etc.",
