        "description": "This course introduces the basic concepts of theatre performance. Through theatre games, improvisation and in-class weekly based practices, students could explore their own potentials, creativities and train their senses. Since speaking is one of the major requirements for an actor, this course also examines the aspects of voice production and public speaking skills. Students will learn to free their voice and examine the intimacy between voice and acting.",
