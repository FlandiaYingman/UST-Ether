Topics include business and individual location decisions, land use, urban amenities, agglomeration economies, local governance, etc. The course covers empirical methods for urban policy analysis, such as non-parametric estimations, spatial regression-discontinuity (RD) designs, the hedonic model, and discrete choice models. This course also discusses advanced general equilibrium models used in contemporary urban literature, including household sorting models, and quantitative spatial models. Students will learn basic tools for the visualization of spatial GIS data, and analytical tools for empirical evaluations of urban policies.",
