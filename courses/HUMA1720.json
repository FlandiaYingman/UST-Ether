            "comment_content": "According to the course description, HUMA 1720 is an introduction to formal philosophical logic, a systematic study of arguments for internal cogency. Course content could be divided into 3 main parts:<br /><br />1. Basics in logic (e.g. validity, soundness, inferences, fallacies, sentential logic symbolisation, etc.)<br />2. Sentential logic derivations<br />3. Predicate logic symbolisation and derivations<br /><br />Grading scheme:<br />Attendance — 5%<br />Term test 1 — 15%&nbsp;&nbsp;(covers 1 only)<br />Term test 2 — 20%&nbsp;&nbsp;(covers 2 only)<br />Term test 3 — 20%&nbsp;&nbsp;(covers 3 only)<br />Final exam — 40%&nbsp;&nbsp;(covers 1, 2 &amp; 3)<br /><br />I would say 1 &amp; 2 is rather straightforward, everyone should be able to do well. The most difficult part of this course is predicate logic symbolisation. Not only because of it being conceptually difficult, but also one can easily make mistakes with incautiousness. While predicate logic derivation is slightly less intellectually demanding.<br /><br />FYI, course content of HUMA 1720 is more or less overlapped with some MATH/COMP courses. A friend of mine lent me his notes of COMP 2711 and I realised 70-80% of the logic stuff is similar to that of HUMA 1720.<br /><br />I have heard that HUMA 1720 offered few years ago didn’t even cover predicate logic. This means we have already learnt sufficiently more than students of few years ago, although the course doesn’t really cover quantifier ordering in depth.",
            "comment_teaching": "Every lecture is well structured with clear focus and carefully selected examples. This can be proven by merely listening to 20-30 mins of William’s presentation. I literally found no reason skipping his lecture, not even for a single lecture.<br /><br />It is praiseworthy that lecture materials are designed in a professional, user-friendly manner, which effectively enhances our understanding of the content. This is in stark contrast to most UST courses where course content is blurred by messy slides and professors’ disastrous articulation. And these also explain why students tend to skip lectures and self-educate.<br /><br />However, I observed that William tends to complicate things, especially when demonstrating sentential and predicate logic derivations. There are indeed “shortcuts” that allow you solve the problems faster, but it seems he seldom uses. I guess because he understands logic far better and deeper than us, and he simply cannot think as simple and straightforward as we students do.<br /><br />This is sometimes a good practice, since problems in advanced logic are often counter-intuitive. I remember once I raised questions about predicate logic symbolisation. It turns out that I oversimplified that problem, in that it is related to quantifier ordering which the course doesn’t really cover.<br /><br />Despite imperfection, I would still give William an A+ for his teaching (even an A is underrated from my perspective). At the very least he knows what he is doing, and we also know what he is doing.",
            "comment_grading": "Decent. I received an A+ with a total score of 93.33%, given the maximum of 99.23%. Not even HUMA 1000A could give me such a high grade. You can do good in this course without prior logic/linguistic training, just like me.<br /><br />I originally thought that I could at most get an A- — I only got 87.5% in the final exam because of my careless mistakes in predicate logic symbolisation, and my inability to solve the hardest predicate logic derivation.<br /><br />You know, cut off score of an A is 94% for some bad grade courses, meaning 90.00-93.99% is still an A-. So, I would say William is really generous in giving out the grade. As a matter of fact, he once said he is impressed by our outstanding performance in assessments.<br /><br />I guess performance during lecture does help as well. I often ask difficult questions when William introduces new things. And he somehow manages to answer in a logical, succinct manner, demonstrating his strong knowledge foundation and illustrating the peculiarity of logic as a discipline. Probably this leaves him with a deep impression.<br /><br />I also remember once he said he has had a student who gave a short, ingenious derivation in term test 3. And that student was me XDD. It is great that he did understand what I have written, I originally thought that I flunked out.",
            "comment_workload": "Reasonable. Hard work does pay off, as long as you work hard on the right track.<br /><br />You can ace the term tests and final exam by merely studying the lecture notes and supplementary exercises prepared by William. You don’t need to recite any definitions nor explanations, as there would be no MCQs nor T/Fs.<br /><br />You need to ensure you have a deep understanding of those materials, rather than aimlessly having lots and lots of practice, especially for predicate logic derivation. The aim of practice, after all, is to solidify what you have learnt.<br /><br />The practice problems you have seen in Logic 2010, reading materials, or even online sources are at most considered “seemingly complicated”. What you will see during term tests and exam, comparatively, are “conceptually hard” — something strange that you have never encountered before.<br /><br />If you don’t know how to do it, no matter how many questions you have practiced and how much time is allowed, you still don’t know how to do it. Luckily, with use of the techniques learnt from lecture, you could at least solve some of them and still do good in the end.",

Even you don't know any discrete maths, it is not hard for you to catch up. In fact, many students get full marks in the first term test. For sentential logic derivation, I would suggest reading the textbook if you find it unclear in the lecture notes.<br />The hardest part of this course is predicate logic.
