        "name": "Contemporary Applications of Physics: Atmospheric Physics - Making Sense of Weather and Climate",
        "description": "Atmospheric physics is a fascinating application of physics that has been part of our daily life since the last century. An accurate daily weather forecast in the modern era relies not only on our intellectual understanding of the atmosphere, but also on the real-time monitoring and numerical modelling of atmospheric motions. Both of them are fruitful applications of atmospheric physics. In recent decades, there has been growing concern over human impacts on global climate. The wide-ranging claims of human-induced climate change have to be supported by scientific theories and evidence. Atmosphere physics plays a central role in such debates as the atmosphere is a core component of the climate system. This course offers both conceptual and quantitative discussions of the fundamental physical processes that shape our weather and climate.",

            "comment_content": "6-7 lectures in total (This course only lasts a month and YES, it is designed so that you can take PHYS4811/12/13 in the same term)<br /> <br />Topics:<br />1) Intro to Atmosphere<br />2) Intro to Atmospheric Thermodynamics I<br />3) Intro to Atmospheric Thermodynamics II<br />4) Atmospheric Stability and Convection<br />5) Atmospheric Dynamics and Weather Systems<br /><br />The topics are fairly complicated and require some knowledge of Thermodynamics. (obviously, they involve A LOT of formulae too) So it can be pretty hard. However, the main reason for this course being rather difficult is the unreasonable amount of course content packed into a 1-month course. It's tough to keep up with all the lectures while also handling your other coursework. I kinda lost whatever little passion I had for Atmospheric dynamics after this course lmao.<br /><br />To be fair, the content is what you would expect from a PHYS course on atmospheric dynamics. However, the overall course structure just sucks. PHYS dept should consider re-designing this course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. CHEUNG isn't necessarily a bad teacher. He's pretty passionate, knows his stuff well, and welcomes questions from students. However, because of the limited time this course has, he goes suuuuper fast during the lectures, skipping a lot of details (would really help a lot if he could explain them tbh). So most of the time, you're just dazed wondering how he ended up with a certain expression/conclusion. He really should just cut down on the course content...",
            "comment_grading": "No HW assignments. Only 1 final quiz/exam at the end of the course. <br />Final contained qns on Skew-T diagram and thermodynamic/atmospheric numerical problem.<br /><br />Total score: 80, Median=28.9, Mean=30.0, SD=8.9<br />My score: 35.5<br />Grade: B :(<br />I suppose the mean gets you around B-/C+. I was really hoping for a B+ considering how horrible everyone did lol but okay.",
            "comment_workload": "There are no HW assignments. In that sense, the workload is virtually none. However, as preluded before in previous sections, the professor just blitzes through all the content, and catching up to lectures can be rather time-consuming.",
