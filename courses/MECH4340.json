            "comment_content": "This course is an introduction to air conditioning systems. It is a good preparatory course if you want to be an engineer focusing on HVAC design. The prerequisite of this course is MECH 3310, but it is expected that you have the background of MECH 2310 and MECH 2210. There will not be much review on those contents during the class, so better review those parts on your own.<br /><br />Course contents are as follows:<br /><br />1. General introduction to AC;<br />2. Central Air-conditioning systems and Unitary Air Conditioners (§2);<br />3. Refrigeration systems (§15);<br />4. Moist air properties (§3);<br />5. Heat transmission in building structures (§5);<br />Midterm<br />6. Solar radiation (§6);<br />7. Heating load calculation §7);<br />8. Cooling load calculation (§ 8);<br />9. Fluid flow, pumps, and piping design (§10);<br />Final Exam<br /><br />Some lecture hours are assigned to two site visits in UST led by HVAC technicians for you to see the real AC systems. The last 2 lectures became computer lab sessions for teaching how to use software to design an AC system for a room. A lab session is also held outside the lecture hours, where the TA played with the AC testing instruments. Our job is to jot some numbers and write a lab report. It does not count any mark and only require submission.<br /><br />To me, the course content is actually not quite enough if you want to be a Building Services engineer focusing on AC design as some of the important contents such as fans and ducting design are omitted. It's better if you read the textbook by yourself to gain more knowledge. Also, I think the professor can spend more time lecturing to cover more contents (he always ended the class 30 minutes earlier in a 3-hour class every week with a 10-minute break)<br /><br />This course helps in strengthening my knowledge learnt in my internship (in Building Services) and extending some contents covered in other courses, such as MECH 4360 and MECH 4350.<br /><br />P.S. If you really want to have a stronger background before joining the BS industry, better study all MECH 4340, 4350 and 4360.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is an expert in thermofluids and he can present the lecture content to us precisely and concisely. However, you need to pay special attention to his lectures as the lecture notes are too brief. A lot of real content is hidden in his speech. I sometimes need to ask him to clarify during the lecture break.<br /><br />In addition, it is extremely difficult to focus in a 9am lecture, either you fall asleep during the lecture or a bit late to attend the class. This becomes more challenging after the midterm, where he started to rush as there are only 3 lectures left for covering the last 4 chapters. In the examples presented in the lecture notes, the information given is not well stated, which may lead to some misunderstanding in how to do the examples.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is that for the midterm exam, prof said it covers until Chapter 4, but some of the Chapter 5 contents are included. Luckily I remembered those content without really studying, but may not be the case for others if they forgot those during the midterm exam.",
            "comment_grading": "• Homework 5%<br />• Classroom Problems &amp; Attendance 10%<br />• Midterm 35%<br />• Project 10%<br />• Final Examination 40%<br /><br />Seems that the TAs are not very serious in grading the homework. A lot of people got full mark or almost full mark. <br />Professor uses classroom problems to check attendance. Those problems are very useful in checking the concepts. You can know how to do those problems if you pay attention to class. It doesn't matter if you get it correct. As long as you have tried and submit your answers, you get the points.<br />The project asks you to design an AC system for a room according to the requirements. You need to draw the room using AutoCAD first, and then design the AC system using the software. <br /><br />The main tool to differentiate different people is the two exams. Refer to the 'workload' session to see the exam format. Common to both exams, it examines your ability to play with those equations (mass balance, energy balance) and get the numbers.<br /><br />My result:<br />Homework: Almost full (everybody does)<br />Midterm: 100/100 (3 out of 39 ppl get full mark this year, prof said he is surprised)<br />Attendance: full (I attend every lecture and hand in all problems)<br />Final: not released, but should be doing fine<br />Project:not released<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />Conclusion: Paying attention in lecture is important!!!",
            "comment_workload": "The workload mostly come from the homework, as the lectures barely cover the actual calculation (lectures only give you the steps for the calculations without giving the actual numbers). There are sources for those homework, but better not directly copying it. Try to do those problems by yourself first and to see any discrepancy between your answer and the solution. The steps in the solutions are too brief and I need to spend a lot of time to figure out the detailed procedures. Also, some problems are not well stated and there are some bugs in the solution, so try to get the overall picture on how to solve the problems instead of just copying the numbers. You don't need to panic if you get numbers different from the solutions. It's normal.<br /><br />As the professor focuses mainly on refrigeration system and moist air properties, the midterm exam is closed-book closed-notes exam. You may need to spend some time on memorizing how the T-S diagram of refrigeration cycle is drawn and how to solve problems related to moist air processes. However, for the final exam, it is closed-book open-notes exam covering all chapters, meaning reviewing all the notes and homeworks are adequate. Again, a lot of calculations are related to Chapter 3 and 4.",
