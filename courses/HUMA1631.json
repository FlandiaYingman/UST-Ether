        "description": "This course is a survey of traditional and contemporary Chinese cultural practices in local communities based on first-hand field-site visits in Hong Kong and its vicinity in the Pearl River Delta area. Students will be trained to conduct observation and interviews in local communities. Field-site experiences and learning will be substantiated by reviewing the literature on Chinese cultures and societies based on fieldwork research. The meaning and value systems of Chinese cultural practices are examined with reference to the local economic, social, political and religious contexts in the national and global settings.",
