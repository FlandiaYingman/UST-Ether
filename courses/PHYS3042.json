            "comment_teaching": "terrible <br />His oral english is so terrible. Double speed in video recording is actually the normal speed for most courses. Ignoring the accent, the low speed means little content covered in each course.<br />i didn't want to attend the lecture but he will post some quiz in class",
            "comment_grading": "He would post some quiz in lecture and 1-2 bonus questions. I got 5 more pts from the second bonus question. Maybe this is the main reason for me to get A+.<br /><br />Midterm is replaced by a small presentation. He gave you a lattice structure one week before and asked you to analyze it. Actually you can discuss it with other students. As long as you attend the presentation, he will give you a score higher than 80. The Q&amp;A part counts little in the presentation score. I gave him a right result of the diagram but can't answer his question. Got 96. Your presentation skill didn't matter at all.<br /><br />Considering the online model, Prof.WANG asked us to write a report in final without checking your similarity index. Hence, i read some review for the topic i selected and rewrite it again in my own words.<br /><br />i believe he gave at least 4-5 students a grade in A range among 6 enrolled students. As long as you finished all the HW, attend the lecture and presentation, submit the final report, you would get A.<br /><br />The grading scheme for F2F mode might be totally different.",
