            "comment_content": "This is a possible course students can take to fulfill IS Major Requirements. Please be warned that the title is extremely misleading, as there is little emphasis on the Internet and instead heavy emphasis on Java programming, starting from absolute basics to object-oriented programming, JavaFX, text IO and exception handling.",
            "comment_teaching": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, lectures are from 10 AM to 3 PM with a lunch break from 12 PM to 1 PM, and tutorials from 3 PM to 5 PM.<br /><br />ZHENG, Rong is a kind-hearted professor who engages the students well, making side conversations in the break. He also knows the subject matter well. However, he teaches rather slowly and could do with more emotion.<br /><br />CHOI, Timture is a humorous TA who engages the students even better than the Professor in that Cantonese is spoken frequently in lab sessions coupled with many jokes. He definitely knows the subject very well and teaches straight to the point.",
            "comment_grading": "There are two quizzes each 15%, one assignment 15%, lab attendance (7/10) 15%, and a group project 40%.<br /><br />Although grading is fair, be warned that the quizzes are worth a lot and only have 22 tricky questions each.<br /><br />You will also only have about a week or so to finish the tumultuous project, so make haste.",
            "comment_workload": "If you have little or no programming background, be prepared to work your balls off. <br /><br />Although the professor may say you don't require the textbook, do find yourself a copy or electronic copy if you want to ensure that you understand the material.",
