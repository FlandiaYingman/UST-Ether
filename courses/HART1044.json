        "description": "Science and Theater both seek to examine and interpret the world to build up knowledge and insights about life. Scientists work on getting closer and closer to the truth behind the phenomenon observed in life, while Theater artists dissect and reveal the truth of lived experiences from different perspectives. The two disciplines are therefore crucial in the betterment of humanity and our relationship with the world. In this practicum arts course, students will explore the beauty of the synthesis of Science and Theater through the study of selected influential plays on science and humanity, and interactive drama workshops exploring the science in performing arts, and the humanity and dramatic nature in science. The drama experience will deepen students' understanding of the connection between science and drama. With the acquired performing skills, the exploration of scientific concepts, and the understanding developed about the plays, students will work in small groups to perform excerpts of the plays in class.",
