        "description": "Wavelets and related transformations play a key role today in virtually all numerical computations and signal processing. Thus they are indispensable tools for any applied mathematician. This course will focus on wavelets and related mathematical tools. They include: The discrete Fourier transform. The fast Fourier transform. Wavelet bases for discrete and continuous variables. The Haar basis. Differentiable wavelet bases. Compact wavelet bases. Multiresolution analysis. We shall also discuss various applications. Students should seek instructor's approval to take this course.",
