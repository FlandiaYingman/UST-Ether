        "description": "This is the first half of a year long introductory graduate course on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We will start with the classical prototype linear PDEs, and introduce a variety of tools and methods. Then we will extend our beginning theories to general situation using the notion of Sobolev spaces, Holder space and weak solutions. We will prove the existence, uniqueness, regularity and other properties of weak solutions. Students without course prerequisite should seek instructor's approval to take the course.",
