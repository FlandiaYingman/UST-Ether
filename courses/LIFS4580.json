You mostly learn about types of programs or techniques (e.g. Microarray, use of Databases etc) used to study DNA sequencing, protein sequencing etc. Although professor gives out simple exercises we can try at home for each lecture, they won't be covered in exams. At the end of the course, it felt like I didn't really learn anything applicable at this instant, because you're learning more about the theories of how they work not how to apply them.. You might find this course easier to understand if you've taken course Biochemistry I.",
