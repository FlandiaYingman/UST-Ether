Nevertheless, due to this course's popularity, you probably can only enrol this course in your senior year. When you finally enrolled, your classmate will likely be a year 4 Engineering student who has already learnt 75% of the course and just wants to fulfil the SSC-S&amp;T CC requirement.",

If your group get 8/10 or above, your final grade will be one sub-grade up. I didn't do the optional project but seems many students said it's difficult to get 8/10 or above.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Tl;dr: If you are good at high school Maths and Physics, you can have a good grade with little effort. Otherwise, go find another course.<br /><br />From the grading scheme, you can notice that this course's grading heavily depends on your exam performance. Both midterm and final exam are MC questions on Canvas. Once you have answered a question, you can't go back.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are required to turn on the camera on your phone to clearly see your face, your hand, and your computer's monitor to prevent cheating. You have 50 minutes to answer 30 MC questions in the midterm exam; and 35 questions in the final. The time is limited and you can't double-check your answers. <br /><br />If you want to take this course since it is one of the &quot;good grade courses&quot;, then you have to consider the following questions:<br />- Are you already familiar with some of the topics covered in this course? For example, you are a EE/ CPEG student, or you have learnt Physics in high school.<br />- Are you good at Maths/ Physics so that you can calculate your answer quickly and accurately in the exam? <br /><br />If both of your answers are &quot;No&quot;, you'd better choose another course to fulfil your common core requirement. I am neither familiar with the course topics nor good at Maths and Physics. I got a bad result in both exams so my grade sucks too. That's fair, but I'd rather take another course.",

Most homework problems are taught in tutorials so make sure to check the tutorial notes. <br />I'm not sure about the workload of the project.<br />There is no attendance. <br /> <br />However, you need to spend extra time to revise the material before the exam if it is the first time you encounter these topics.

There would normally be three outcomes:<br /><br />i) If you are an EE student (or MAE), the grading is very GOOD because you should be familiar with most of the content. You can easily score high marks with little effort. There are also many business students whom you can really shit on in the course.<br /><br />ii) If you have no pre-requisite knowledge and only expect a fair grading (B-range or A-) with a fair amount of effort, the grading is kind of good to you. The content itself is not hard to understand, and the B-range of this course is also wide.<br /><br />iii) If you have no pre-requisite knowledge and expect a good grade (A or above) from this course, then the grading is BAD to you. I am sure that it is almost impossible for you to beat the year 4 engineering students in the exams due to very limited time. Of course if you are a genius then you can ignore this.<br /><br />P.S.

(Disclaimer: I think the pace of the live lectures is too slow, and the prof sometimes includes supplementary but less significant information so I skipped them. I'm unsure if attending the lectures would be more efficient in terms of learning.)<br /><br />So I'd like to give it a B (maybe between B and A)",

Instead, try to fill in as much information as you can since the professor will only be reading your PPT and you need to make sure you show that you have a good understanding of the topic.<br /><br />Can't necessarily remember my mark.

The principle is the same.<br /><br />For both midterm and final. I just started studying the night before as both of them are heavily dependent on doing calculations. If you know how to do it, you are good to go.<br /><br />For the finals, however, I would advise you to go over the concepts taught in class as they will appear in some of the MCs. That could be a crucial factor if you want to get a good grade. <br /><br />Speed is also important as well, while the questions might be easy. It is more about quantity than quality. Midterm has only around 50 mins, so you need to be quick. So is the final. Good Luck. :)",

Final is cumulative, by mainly the material in chapters 4 to 6 will be tested. <br />The content is easy to understand for everyone, so the science/ engineering students do not have much advantages in it, except they can take less time on revision if they have learnt the concept already.<br />The exams are intense in terms of the testing time. You will find it bit rush to finish the whole exam paper, so if you are prepared for answering fast and finish it on time, you are better than the majority of the course.",

Therefore, it is not likely for students to struggle in learning if they put effort. <br />There is no participation mark, and the lecture videos are provided, so it is up to you to attend the lecture or not. If you are exam-oriented, just attending tutorial maybe fine enough. The TA also responds fast via email.",

You and your partner are not necessarily science/ engineering students as the groups with high scores are from business school.<br />Exam is easy, you will have positive return if you revise. I got 1 score above the mean in midterm, and I got 1 SD above in final, I got an A- at last.",

HKDSE physics covered some of the topics. As a SBM student with HKDSE physics background, the difficulty is moderate. I know lots of classmates not attending the lectures because it's really really really boring. You can simply check the lecture notes by yourself. If you don't understand the materials, it is useful to go to the tutorial class.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, you don't really need lots of time to understand the contents, even if you are a SBM student.",

We can review the lecture and tutorial videos online. <br /><br />Personally, I think there is no need to go to lecture. Miss Lau is a nice professor, but she talks really slowly, and the lecture is very boring. It is more effective to review the lecture video in 1.5x pace. <br /><br />Raymundo, the TA, is very helpful. The tutorial is faster and more precise, compared to the lecture. He is so nice and helpful that he can answer the questions immediately. <br /><br />I give a D to Miss Lau's teaching and a B to Raymundo's teaching. So, I take a C in average.",

Because the school can't have like 50 ELEC students getting full marks, they decided to make the exam a time-attack. Especially for the mid term exams, there were like 17pages of questions in a 50 min exam. I got really nervous due to the overwhelming amount of questions and ended up making stupid mistakes. For example, there's a lot of trick questions such as having bits and bytes mixed up (one question might have Kb and another might have KB). I guess it was their way of preventing full marks but it's really not an exam to test what you learned. It's just an exam to distribute students to a smooth bell curve.<br /><br />There is an optional project you can do to receive extra grade (from A- to A, c+ to b-). However the professor told us that it's gonna be quite competitive to get that extra grade. I didn't do it because I don't it's worth the effort and time.",

Don't struggle on the questions that you are not familiar with.<br /><br />For the midterm exam, you may not have enough time to finish the paper. You may finish the short questions first because the short questions are easier, more straightforward and more similar to homework/tutorial notes than the MCQs. The MCQs are quite tricky - beware of what the questions are asking you about!<br /><br />For the final exam, invest in the MCQs as they are easier than the short questions. Some questions are conceptual. Going through the past final exam paper once will help, as some MCQs are similar to those in the past paper. If you have enough time, read the lecture notes (especially chapter 5 &amp; 6) as well. The short questions are quite challenging. (I scored 58/58 in MCQs and 58.5/72 in short questions. You can see that the MCQs helped me a lot in scoring high in the final exam.)",
