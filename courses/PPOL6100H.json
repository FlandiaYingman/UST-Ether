        "description": "This course introduces students to the political dimensions of environmental policy. It explores how various political actors and institutions interact with each other in shaping environmental policy. The first part of the course presents the normative and ideational foundations for environmental politics and discusses the major forms of collective action. The second part analyses the governmentâ€™s policy responses to environmental ideas and activism in the context of capitalist political economy. Students will benefit from the ability to think politically about the environment, which is essential for successful environmental policymaking in practice.",
