            "comment_content": "Not really suggested for junior students.<br />Best if you were doing FYP, or you want to do a PG later on. <br /><br />Prof. Wu's part focused on classic biochemical research. <br />Great for UG students who are into BICH research, a brief training on thinking scientifically. <br />A lot of contents on kinases: protein structures, mechanisms, inhibitors, drug targets.<br />No mid-term exams, only presentation on a paper and an interview (chit-chat?) with Prof. Wu. Again, good pratice for students going for research: to read and criticize a reseach paper. <br /><br />A short interview section with Prof. Wu, he will ask you questions on lecture materials. Both basic stuffs like kinase structures and experimental designs. All are taught in the lectures.<br /><br /><br />Prof. Zhang's part were more on protein stuctures and calcium-binding proteins. More like to understand the materials than to memerise it. Some materials overlap with LIFS 4540. Nothing too difficult, always ask them to repeat unclear points. <br /><br />A short final exam from Prof. Zhang which wasn't expected. He asked if we want to present the paper or exam, and exam was the final call. <br />We were able to bring our labtops for the exam, so you would expect the questions won't be straight forward. Apply the knowledge you've got and lecture materials and you shouldn't do too bad.",
            "comment_teaching": "Very small class. The Prof. remembers you, so dont skip classes.<br />Great atmosphere for teaching and learning. They encouraged you to ask and answer questions. <br /><br />Don't be shy, they are both very nice scientists and professors, do learn from them.",

            "comment_workload": "Almost no workload.<br />Just attend the lectures and present the paper given.<br />One open-laptop final exam.",
