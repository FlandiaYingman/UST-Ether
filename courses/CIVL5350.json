            "comment_content": "The course covers almost everything related to typical bridge design from early planning to construction stage.<br /><br />Main topics include:<br />- Site constraints<br />- Selection of bridge structural form<br />- Selection of bridge construction method<br />- Prestressed concrete<br />- Preliminary bridge dimensioning<br />- Loading<br />- Prestressing design<br />- Bridge accessories<br />- Arch bridge<br />- Seismic load<br />- Ship impact load",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Lee intends to teach the course in a practical way with many real-life examples such as the newly-commissioned TKO Cross Bay Link Bridge.<br /><br />He also teaches the bridge design process step-by-step to make sure everyone understands. Lecture notes are clear.",
            "comment_grading": "Dr. Lee seems to be satisfied about the performance on the course project, despite not knowing the individual grades of each project submission.",
            "comment_workload": "The course is 100% graded by the course project, which is separated into three parts:<br /><br />- Part 1: Appreciation of site constraints (20%)<br />- Part 2: Selection of bridge structural form and construction method (30%)<br />- Part 3: Scheme design (50%)<br /><br />Personally find Part 3 the most challenging because it consists of the most technical items such as bridge dimensioning and prestressing design.<br /><br />In overall, workload depends on how much effort you put into the coursework.",
