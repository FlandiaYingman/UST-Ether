The stories selected range in style from realism to fantasy, modernism, and postmodernism. In addition to a critical analysis of themes and the art of fiction writing, students will gain from this course a deeper understanding of human experiences and different outlooks on life characteristic of the western world.",

But if you work hard getting a decent grade is not too difficult.<br /><br />I have no lit and history background but still get an ok grade (given I didn't participate in class and had no time to study for my final exam) so just go for it for those interested in lit but with no prior knowledge",
            "comment_workload": "not light at all but not as bad (again if you like eng lit)<br /><br />need to read the story before class (most of them are short, with a few exceptionally long ones) otherwise you will have no idea what is going on in class<br /><br />prepare for the project (like a drama): from the perspective of characters in the story or the writers<br /><br />essay: 1000 words, easy piecey but I guess you need to spend more time on it if you want an A range for it<br /><br />overall not too bad but this course does take time!",

In this way, it is easy for the instructor to distinguish who has prepared in advance. An essay question will be given for homework which takes up 30% of the grade.<br /><br />There's one group project and one final exam which contribute 15% and 40% respectively. Groups are to be formed at the beginning of the semester. The group project consists of using a given theme and explaining it to the class using 3 or more of the short stories. The final exam consists of 2 short questions and 1 essay question.",
