Even if you know the meaning of the words, it is quite difficult to create a sentence with exact, good grammar.<br /><br />Don't miss more than 5 classes, it's an automatic fail.

Your group has to make a presentation about various vacation spots of a city/country (except China) for different target audiences (such as honeymoon couple, elderly people, university students, wildlife adventurers, etc). Each group has to speak for about 10 to 15 minutes, and powerpoints are allowed. <br /><br />The essay is also about attracting your target audience to a certain country/city, promoting the famous scenic spots. You also have to make a travel schedule. This essay should be around 800 words.",
