        "description": "The Supreme Court has played a powerful role throughout U.S. history, sometimes protecting the rights of economic elites and sometimes, the rights of social, religious, and economically-disadvantaged minorities. Often, it has advanced civil liberties and civil rights, but sometimes, it has acquiesced in their restriction. Always, it has allocated power between the different branches and levels of American government. How does such a constitutional structure work in theory and practice? What major events have shaped it and how has it shaped major events? How independent of political pressures is it and how independent should it be? What has the Court decided recently and what is it likely to do in the near future?",
