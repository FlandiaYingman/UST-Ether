        "description": "Girls and women in developing countries suffer multiple deprivations through the interacting effects of poverty and gender discrimination. This course aims to help students develop an understanding of the interactions between gender and development through a study of theoretical frameworks as well as a discussion of practical case studies. Students will compare different approaches to gender and development and will learn about various strategies for empowering women in developing countries - such as improving their access to credit, giving them cash transfers and increasing their political participation. By the end of the course, students should be able to critically analyze developmental policies and interventions through a gender lens.",

            "comment_content": "The content is fine. To some extent, I think I learned the three points in the &quot;Intended learning outcomes&quot;:<br />1. Students will develop an understanding of the social construction of gender and its consequences for the day to day lives of women in developing countries.<br />2. Students will understand the benefits as well as the drawbacks of various strategies that have been used to empower women in developing countries â€“ such as micro-credit, political quotas and cash transfers.<br />3. Students will develop the ability to critically assess the design and implementation of development projects and propose modifications to enhance gender equity.",
            "comment_teaching": "The lecture was 3 hours and the structure of it won`t make you feel bored. The teacher will first give the lesson with ppt, basically it is the elaborate and explanation of the reading of that week. Next will be the reading presentation conducted by students group. Then the whole class will form a circle and start to discuss the reading. The last part of the lecture is some in-class assignments (can be finished as group or individual form) to work with.<br />The teacher is from Indian and has accent but not so hard to understand. She is willing to talk with students and answer questions in the break and after class.",
            "comment_grading": "Just fair I guess. The composition of the assessment is quite comprehensiveðŸ‘‡<br />Group Presentation of readings 10%<br />Individual Term Paper 35%<br />Group project: report &amp; presentation 35%<br />Class participation 20%<br /><br />I think there`s no need to worry about the grade. There were only about 20 students enrolled in the course this semester and the teacher is not mean/killer.",
            "comment_workload": "I`d say it was a bit heavy at the end, especially when I got a reading presentation, group project (consists of a presentation and a written report) and my individual term paper altogether since the interval between each due was no more than three days.<br />In regular weeks, students have to prepare two reading presentations as well as the reading materials were a &quot;must-read&quot; for the lecture content is closely related with it and we have to participate in the discussion about the readings.",
