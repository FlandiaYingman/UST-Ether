Students will perform a series of organic experiments related to the theories learnt in the related lecture courses. Students will be trained to practice a wide range of fundamental organic laboratory techniques, operate chemical instruments, relate the physical and chemical principles and theory in practice, and develop their data interpretation and analytical skills. For non-CHEM students in programs that designate this course as required course/specified elective only.",

(It is categorized under the assignment page, which is weird) Another footage showing procedures of the experiments is also available, which allows you to familiarize yourself with what to do. The instructor will demonstrate the operations before you start to do it yourself in the lab session, but I still recommend you watch both videos and read the manual before actually attending.",

            "comment_workload": "The worksheet is divided into two parts, the first two part for recording experimental data, some calculations (e.g. recovery percentage) and the second part for some more in-depth questions regarding the mechanisms and principles. The briefing video will be needed in this part, and it's safer if you check your answer with friends before handing in. Also don't forget to attach the original data sheet with TA signature as it will result in mark deduction, although there is no reserved place for it in the worksheet. (weird again)<br />The final exam is kinda difficult... composed of 40 MC (40 points) and several short questions (10 points), and only one hour is given, which is quite tight. The short questions test on your understanding of the principles behind each experiment, (comparing hydrophobicity, separating compounds from mixtures, etc.) as well as some details that you have no idea that they will test on (e.g. which material is some parts of the IR liquid cell made of). Some questions are also similar to those in the worksheet, so make sure you understand the worksheet questions and everything in the briefing video if you want to score high in the exam.",
