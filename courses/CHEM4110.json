            "comment_content": "A more in-depth study on the spectrometry from IR to MS to NMR compared to CHEM3120. In fact, it is fine if you have no background in reading those spectrums since he started teaching from 0. However, you cannot survive the course if you cannot survive the spectrum in CHEM3120. <br /><br />The main focus of the course is undoubtedly NMR. Compared to CHEM3120, we try to study how we can use coupling constant more skillfully and have a taste on 2D-NMR. We also study the factors affect chemical shifts. These are all useful technique especially for synthetic chemist. <br /><br />Since our midterm exam change to presentation, we don't really need to understand IR and MS deeply. In final exams, I think CHEM3120-level IR and MS is enough this year.<br /><br />The detailed topics remain same as other years.",
            "comment_teaching": "I think he tries to teach in this course, and he is open to students' questions, but still, he is not providing me the best learning experience. <br /><br />One main complaint from me is he tried to tell us how the NMR works (from the typical NMR to DEPT to 2D), but I could not understand anything. While he did not include these theories in exam as I have expected, he should really try to go through more example with us instead, says solving a textbook problem in class.<br /><br />Fortunately, I find UCI open courseware provide their course recording on these topics (CHEM203) for free, and the Professor, James Nowick, and his TA go through some insightful examples in their discussion session. You may have a look. (Although I think it is a PG course, and they cover more than CHEM4110)",
            "comment_grading": "In this semester, Prof Tong change midterm exams into presentation on a set of IR+ MS spectrum selected by students themselves. Since only few minutes of present is required, the workload for the midterm assignment is smaller than that in a typical midterm exam. The problem is probably that we have no clear idea what he wants to listen.<br /><br />For final exam, I personally find it disastrous. The MCs are easy, and the 2D NMR questions (1 only ask about INADEQUATE, 1 with 1D 1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, HMQC) is at an acceptable difficulty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But he also set some questions that he gives us the reaction, and we need to propose the products based on spectrums. Unfortunately, he doesn't give expansion for 1H NMR, so I have no idea what really the coupling patterns are. When I try to look at the value of chemical shifts instead, I cannot distinguish which is which as there are too many peaks in a small area. For 13C NMR, he did not provide DEPT, but he wants us to assign the signal to the carbon. These 4 questions drove me crazy.<br /><br />Here are the statistics from Canvas:<br /><br />Midterm assignment (Presentation; out of 70)<br />Mean: 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Median: 60\tHigh: 70<br />Upper Quartile: 65\tLow: 40<br />Lower Quartile: 55<br />Me: 65<br /><br />Final exam (out of 130)<br />Mean: 70.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Median: 63.5 High: 101<br />Upper Quartile: 97.5\tLow: 30<br />Lower Quartile: 48.5<br />Me: 99<br /><br />My final grade: A<br />While it is still reasonable to get an A based on my score relative to UQ, the class only consists of 15 students this year from class quota, and 15/4=3.75. This probably mean getting the best grade remains challenging. On the other hand, my friend claim he just scored around mean last year and got A-, so you can consider it as a good grade course.",
            "comment_workload": "In fact, there is only midterm presentation and final, so the workload only comes from your desire to practice more for the exams. Furthermore, you may just spend few hours for preparing midterm presentation, and you are basically not required to memorize anything. However, you probably want to do lots of practices if you want to perform well.",
