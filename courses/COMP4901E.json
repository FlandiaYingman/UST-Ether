            "comment_content": "There's not much to learn here as your main objective is to develop a mobile application either Android, iOS, or a hybrid app (as long as the main application is for mobile phones not computers). The content will mostly be about guides on app proposal, development, documentation, prototypes, and testings.<br /><br />For the project, you can either choose to make your own app, find someone who has an idea, or help NGOs developing mobile apps. You can form a team and the instructor has no limit on how many people on the team.",
            "comment_teaching": "The instructor is nice and approachable. The teaching assistants care a lot about your project and will try their best to get in touch and give feedback with your progress. One of them will even give you his phone number in case you have a rather urgent problem with the project.",
            "comment_grading": "100% of your grading is from your project, no midterm nor final.<br />I forgot the distribution, but I think about 15% is for proposal presentation and report, 25% for prototype demo and report, and 60% for the final app demo and report.<br />If you really have a lot of passion on the project and successfully finish what you've started, the instructors will be very impressed. This along with good proposal and prototype report and you will get A range.",
            "comment_workload": "You will finish what you've started.<br />Workload varies depending on your project proposal. Some might have a rather light job but for my case, I put too much targets on the proposal. It made me spending sleepless nights developing the app. <br />You might find the need of making reports and presentation annoying too especially if you don't have someone in your group who focuses on the business part.",
