Basic knowledge of machine learning will be taught to tackle robotic perception problems. Target applications include IoT, self-driving vehicle, UAV and service robot. The emphases are on hands-on experience in real projects with real-time algorithms. Applications of provided libraries or tools are expected.",

Midterm<br />本身係 open notes，唔駛點溫書，印晒啲 notes 出嚟帶入去做就唔會差得去邊<br /><br />3.

            "comment_content": "The prerequisites: It is good to have the background knowledge on the prerequisites, but you will be using them only in a few topics throughout the course, e.g. probability for Bayesian network and HMM and linear algebra for linear regression. If you do not have the prerequisites, you can try waiving them and I believe this would not cause a real issue.<br />What do not mention in the prerequisites is that you need to run ROS (Robot Operating System) on Linux for the final project, so if you do not feel comfortable with programming in Python or C++ and using Linux, this might be a big problem.<br /> <br />The course contents:<br />1: Information Processing and Modern Robotics of recent years<br />2: Introduction to Machine Learning and Probabilistic Reasoning<br />3: Graphical Models and Hidden Markov Model<br />4: Online estimation (Extended Kalman Filter) - localisation and mapping<br />5: Regression - with application to state estimation<br />- Midterm -<br />6: Kernel Methods for regression, Gaussian Process - Wifi-based localization<br />7: Kernel Methods for classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM)<br />8: Iterative Closest Point - 3D reconstruction in real-time<br />9: Sampling methods - SLAM problem revisits<br />10: Mean shift and clustering approaches - Visual tracking and quantization<br />11: Classification for computer vision: PCA and Adaboost<br />12: Deep Learning and Deep Q-Learning<br />13: Robotic Challenge<br /><br />Note: This is NOT an A.I. / Machine Learning course",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching was very detailed before the midterm, and it was a complete opposite after the midterm. Anyway, the teaching of Prof. LIU was quite nice, he explained things clearly and concisely. That is to say it was easy to follow his teaching during classes and it was not difficult at all to acquire new concepts. There was even a review section for the midterm. The lecture notes might seem dull, but they were definitely well prepared and organised.<br />In contrast, the labs were a mess. It was clear that the T.A.s were unprepared for the labs, many technical problems about the robots were not discovered until students actually encountered them. As a result, most of the lab time were used to wait for the T.A.s to solve the problems. Therefore, only little progress was made in each lab.<br />But to be fair, that was because the T.A.s were busy on their project, and it might be a different situation when you take this course. Just keep your fingers crossed when you click the enroll button and hope that there will not be a major project for the T.A.s. Otherwise, you are on your own.",
            "comment_grading": "The marks were unknown except for the homework (not even the midterm nor the final project). However, it appeared that the grading was very good. Three of my friends and I did decently well in the homework and final project ,and we all got A. Overall, Prof. LIU was very generous in giving marks, including the final project.",
            "comment_workload": "3x Graded Homework: 40%<br />5x Mini-quiz: 5% (easy questions, I guessed they were mainly for attendance purposes)<br />4x Lab sessions: 10% <br />1x Midterm Exam: 25%<br />1x Final Robotic Challenge: 20%<br /><br />Note:<br />The Labs: 2 topics in total, 2 for labs each topic. The 2 topics involved: a two-wheeled self-balancing robot, and a three-wheeled camera car with NVIDIA Jetson. You have to choose one out of the two topics and write a report about it. Most people chose the first one because they could not finish the second one.<br />The Midterm: The difficulty of the midterm was similar to that in homework, it would not be a problem of you do the homework by yourself. The midterm was open-note, but hard copy only.<br />The Final Project: The final project involves robotic localisation (and some other robotic perception tasks) in a simulated environment using ROS. It was not difficult but it would take you some time. Most of the students could finish all of the tasks. It was conducted in groups of one to three students.",
