It is an evidence-based, data-driven approach to managing people at work. In this course, we will examine the HR data and analytical tools necessary to conducting HR analytics, and apply them in resolving HR issues such as recruitment and selection, performance evaluation, training and development, compensation, and retention. We will also discuss the ethical aspects related to HR analytics.",
