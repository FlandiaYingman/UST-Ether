        "description": "Robotics is a fast developing area. It is located right at the crossing of electronics, mechanical design, computer science, computer vision and many other directions. An important characteristic that can tell \"a robot\" from \"a machine\" is its embedded intelligence. The basic format of intelligence is to understand, estimate or even predict an unknown entity (object, map, relation among features, etc.) from known information. Machine Learning is the key to find the inherent relationship between these knowns and unknowns. In this course, students will learn fundamentals of robots, from simple car-like robots to flying robots (UAV). More importantly, they will grant intelligence to these target robots, realizing autonomous behaviors. We emphasize hand-on experience in real projects with real-time algorithms. Meanwhile, fundamental machine learning and information processing techniques will be explained in the context of applications, so that the students can grasp the essence of these practical algorithms. Third-year students in Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Others may be accepted with instructor's consent.",
