        "description": "This course will cover a broad spectrum of concepts and practices in Geographical Information System (GIS). It starts with the fundamental concepts and elements in geographic science and technology. Spatial data modeling and integration methods will then be discussed followed by various geospatial analysis approaches for both vector and raster data. Cartographic principles, spatial relationships, projection and coordinate systems will be discussed in-depth. During the course, students will be introduced to contemporary GIS software and apply GIS technology support local and regional environmental planning and management.",

Feel very great and unexpected, hahaha :)<br /><br />As the final quiz and final examination count a significantly big proportion, please be careful to answer the questions, and make sure you have used reseasonable/correct ArcGIS geoprocessing functions (e.g., intersect vs spatial join; union; clip; extract values to points; multipart to singlepart) <br /><br />This course is indeed challenging, especially is the quiz and final exam (only 2.5 hours to complete) but if you know the logic behind the questions and GIS functions, you can find the correct way and answer very fast. :)",
