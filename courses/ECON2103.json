I felt really frustrated because all of my friends got much higher than me.<br /><br />For the second mid term, I got 81% :( and the mean is 81%. So, here I really want to tell you guys to work hard on the first one because the second mid term covers more difficult content. Don't be like me and imagine that there is still a chance to catch up in the second mid-term.<br /><br />For final, I worked very hard. and got 93%, mean = 87%.

For assignments, you can take the online solutions for reference :), easy to get full marks.<br /><br />The only workload is the revision part. It is complete ok if u didn't pay attention to class because you have textbook (to save money, get the online one). <br /><br />I suggest you can read the book to clarify your understanding. Please pay extra attention to the relationship between terms, for e.g. when A increase, B must increase (there are a lot of relationships, make sure you don't get mess up).<br /><br />Also, pay attention to the definitions, you do not have to memorise, but you need to be clear about them as they will be covered in the MC questions. <br /><br />Lastly, don't just focus on the quantity of questions when you do practice. There are practices provided by the TA, if you have limited time, I suggest you to focus working on those practices and get familiar with them. If you listen to me, I believe you will at least get a B. Thanks for reading. Good luck :)",

And it can truly help us develop critical thinking towards real life problems.<br /><br />Btw, a good understanding of math differentiation and integration is not really necessary, but will help for sure. I am in fact an engineering student and understanding the math indeed helped in many ways.",

Many previous students says that Wing likes to give usless chats during lectures, and TBH, I enrolled this course not just because it's a CCC course, but I expected to &quot;have some fun&quot; attending his lectures as we were told that his lectures were like comedy shows LOL. But, as far as I'm concerned, this sem, there is no comedy show. In fact, the way he delievers and approaches to different problems are really helpful, as the logic that he approaches to probems are exceedingly important. And reading the textbook helps you to familiarize with the concepts.<br /><br />In the final exam, you will see that the logic is EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT. The questions are really well designed that it seems as if anyone can answer it but only people who really understands the logic can get high scores. Personally, I attended all his lectures, and had indeed understood the logic Wing approaches to problems. And this kind of understanding is very rewarding. So Please make sure that you understand the logic he approaches to problems. and of course you need to understand the concept before understanding the logic.<br /><br />So, The lecture helps you with the logic and the textbook helps you with the concepts.",

But starting from topics marked with 🔶, such as the cost curves in firm production and firms' decision under different market structures, rigorous mathematical and graphical reasoning are required. In these topics, you will see different curves intersecting seemingly randomly like a fountain (but indeed with a rationale behind), and what math noobs can do is to stare at the lecture ppts and remain puzzled. So this course isn't really for math noobs.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />🔷 Ten Principles of Economics<br />🔷 Thinking Like an Economist<br />🔷 Interdependence and the Gains from Trade<br />🔷 The Market Forces of Supply and Demand<br />🔷 Elasticity and Its Applications<br />🔷 Efficiency of Market<br />🔷 Government meets Market<br />🔶 The Costs of Production<br />🔶 Firms in Perfect Competitive Market<br />🔶 Monopoly<br />🔶 Strategic Interaction and Oligology<br /><br />The final exam was an absolute mind blower compared to the strikingly easy midterms. It required us to answer long questions with full economic analysis backed by graphs and economic concepts. Algebraic equations are needed in the oligopoly part and those who are bad at algebra can screw up the final exam easily.<br /><br />DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE if you're a math noob!!!",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Siu Kam Wing might be popular among all the students as he often digresses, and turns his lectures into life lessons. Lectures were dominated by mainland students in the front rows and as they had much better mathematical reasoning than most of the locals, he resorted to a more mathematical approach in explaining the concepts, and what maths dumbs like me could do was just to freak out and stay confused.<br /><br />The TA is from ECOF and his tutorials are even more &quot;mathematical&quot; than Wing's lecture. He does the mathematical proofs of basically everything which isn't needed in the exams and the whole course at all. He fails to explain the very basic concepts and I doubt whether he himself actually understands them.<br /><br />DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE if you're a math noob!!!",

Landing on the median only results in a B-. Though I luckily got an A, most of my friends ended up in B- or even C range.

This makes the mean rather high (about 80%), so revisions and hard work is really needed. Exam is designed to be long and demanding (which is the original wordings of Prof. Li who says this could increase the opportunity cost of cheating, which I think is reasonable). Turns out the mean is quite low (about 50%). As everyone has a not-so-high score, you don't need a very high marks to get a prominent grade.<br /><br />At last, attendance is not counted towards the grade, but it is not advised to skip the lessons. They are really useful.<br /><br />For me, I have done all assignments and +1sd in one of the midterm and the final, and turns out an A grade, which is good enough for me as a newcomer in the world of Economics.",

Usually each assignment has a deadline separated by one week so you don't need to rush them all the way. The questions are selected to be applicable and can be used as a revision of the topic in class. An assignment usually takes 1 to 1.5 hours to complete.

He likes sharp and swift responses and sometimes will push students further to perfect their answers, which may come across as intimidating<br /><br />He also has an emphasis on 'system of thinking' and does not really like drilling papers.

Final (cumulative syllabus) is hard in the sense some questions have multiple concepts combined that may make it hard to answer in the long questions. Marking is strict by the TAs and it is hard to argue with them in short questions and long questions.<br /><br />*Terrible choice* as a common core or business minor requirement.

Some contents are quite abstract when they are taught in lectures, but problem set questions will help you understand those concepts clearly with numerical situations.<br />2. As we all know, the final exam is the part that decides your final grade. First, I would say that the final exam questions are very beautiful and successful in the sense that if you don't really understand the concepts and logic behind them, it's almost impossible to get a good grade because the questions seem to be quite unrelated to the materials taught in the class and it seems that even people without economics learning can also answer those questions. But this is not true. If you answer those questions as if you have never learnt economics, it's no doubt that you will get a terrible score in the final exam. However, as long as you can see the nature of those questions, you'll find that they are exactly what he has taught in the lectures. Just follow the logic and it's simple to get a good grade. I have to say that Professor SIU designed those questions pretty well and this shows he is very professional.

However, a lot of the teaching must also be done on the student's own accord to fully grasp the concepts. <br /><br />She makes really good Powerpoints, so going to each class isn't necessarily needed. However, she will add additional notes in-class that won't be on the Powerpoint, so missing class is certainly a little risky.",

There are 2 midterm and a final exam, which comprises the rest of the grading. She will calculate the other 80% using either both midterm exams: midterm1(.2) + midterm2(.2) + final (.4) OR 1 midterm with a higher score: midterm(.3) + final(.5).",

For my lecturer he covered<br />1st mid term: basic background for micro economics, supply and demand, elasticity<br />2nd mid term: efficiency, tax, government policies, cost in production and firms in competitive market<br />Final: all mentioned stuff + monopoly and oiligopoly<br /><br />Some people said that Wing's content may be hard for people who are not very good at maths since he goes mathematical, but for me, a engineering student who is fair in maths,actually dislike how he explain differenciation and integration in words rather than mathemactical presentation which makes things harder to understand, but consider that this course does not expect students to have any math background, it may be slightly hard to understand them by words also.",

Also ask your lecturer if you're confused with the topic, it is better to spend more time getting a concept right than to have the wrong concept throughout the course. You can check if your concept is right by doing practice questions. Also I've found some youtube channels that gives tips and tricks which I found really useful, and these are not taught in lecture. It makes it so much easier to get the concepts right, instead of memorizing or spend too much time trying to understand exactly why a concept is as it is.",

            "comment_teaching": "Wing is actually the best professor I encountered in UST. He is able to explain all the economic concept in a 'raw' way, even a primary student can understand.<br /><br />His digression is not boring at all and you can learn interesting life stories from him.<br /><br />Wing prepares his own ppts and they are sometimes different to the textbook. My suggestion is to read the textbook before attending Wing's lectures.<br /><br />TA Teresa prepares optional tutorials every week. She actually provide very detailed notes and concise explanation (though I recommend you actually attend the lectures because Wing like to test things on the ppt)<br /><br />Like the others said, if you like learning by grinding papers, you will be disappointed because Wing emphasises 'way of economic thinking'. Also, like the others said, Wing is very pushy and can come off as intimidating, because he wants perfection in lecture discussions.<br /><br />Right now the only thing I remember is Wing and Albert are producing meat and potatoes in a two goods, two producer world...",
            "comment_grading": "Two grading schemes, count higher of the 2.<br />Scheme 1. 10% homework + 2x15% midterms + 60% final<br />Scheme 2. 10% homework + 20% higher of the 2 midterms + 70% final.<br /><br />Heard the others say if above 1 SD is A range, and above 2 SD is A+.<br /><br />Homework: Count n-2 amount of problem sets issued. Doesn't matter if it's right or wrong. This semester total of 12 sets were issued.<br /><br />Midterms: Non cumulative and covers Part 1 and 2 respectively. Both were supposed to be 80 minute, 50 MC questions but Wing removed 10 questions in MT due to student complaint<br />Midterm 1 (/50). Mean: 36.75, Median: 37, SD: 6.44<br />Midterm 2 (/40). Mean: 31.9, Median: 33, SD: 5.3<br /><br />Many people complained that MT 1 was too hard so Wing removed 10 questions from MT 2.<br /><br />Final: Mixture of short and long questions in 2 hours (its cumulative). Must use graph and diagram in explanation!!! The technique to getting good score is to answer in a way that Wing wants you to answer (meaning just getting the answer 'correct' is not enough)<br />Final (/100). Mean: 59.5, Median: 59, SD: 16.3<br /><br />Personally I get 37/50 in MT 1 (totally clueless because I was not used to Wing's teachings), 37/40 for MT 2, and 89/100 in the final. Finally get A+.",
            "comment_workload": "One problem set every week for each chapter. You can just search online for answers, but I recommend actually attempting the questions first, because they can be quite similar to the final exam.<br /><br />Older reviews say you can hand in blank pdf, but I would not do this, because Wing said he will check if you actually answered the questions.<br /><br />If you spent appropriate time on this course, you can excel in it.<br /><br />NOTE: Wing said that Nash equilibrium and deriving cournot duopoly have a high chance of repeating in the final... It's probably true.",

So if you are below mean in any exam, well your grading will be devastating.<br /><br />Since the score difference between every student is so low, even a tiny difference in marks will result in maybe 1-2 sub grade differences.<br /><br />Also, the A range is very small. Personally, I got over 99%(if added bonus mark) in the course. Yet, I still only got an A. So, if you are aiming for the best, make sure you have to be very careful with every question cuz a single careless mistake may result in dropping a sub grade.<br /><br />Kind reminder: try to put lots of effort into the first midterm, as the questions are easier, the competition between classmates are smaller(most of them had not yet realized what awaits them), and you can go for full marks if you are careful enough.",

The scope is designed for those who have not studied Economics in secondary school, and the concepts are explained using simple daily life scenarios to make them easier to understand even for beginners.

Even as a common core, if you are planning to put minimal effort on it like you may treat other common core courses, then you may end up with a bad grade so be warned. It is not difficult to get a B range as long as you understand the concepts taught and have handed in all the homework problem sets. But if you want to get an A range, then you will have to work very hard.",

Although a lot of the questions were available online, it took me hours to complete each (10 questions each with multiple sub-questions), but in the end they helped me to understand the concepts and the exam. PS2 required me to draw like 10 graphics (annoying since I had to scan each one and AirDrop it lmao). Start doing it a week before the deadline at the very least.<br /><br />IMO you need to understand deeply the concepts and relationships within (all of the exams were open book exams for me, so no need to memorize). Tutorials are optional, but make sure to practice from the tutorial question sets bcs some of them will appear in the exams. Good luck!",

            "comment_teaching": "While many would argue that Professor Siu, Kam Wing goes off topic often, I would use that as a strength in his teaching, as usually he would go off topic to help support his teaching and add humour to what we are learning. It really helps us remember the content and stay engaged in class. As this course also involves some calculus and basic mathematics, his way of teaching really does help and it really is nice to get some words of wisdom for life in general here and there.<br /><br />I only have two criticisms for his teaching. One would be his lack of explanation on how he would grade the finals (how we should format our answers for the short questions). Whereas the second is his pacing for some classes. Since we had spent about two to three lessons on just the principals of economics instead of just one (I thought one would be enough, but it was just stretched because of some unnecessary and repeated but rephrased questions asked in class). Due to this, we had to have two extra lessons during the study week or late in the evening on random days.<br /><br />On another note, GUO, Bing's tutorials are very well structured and straight to the point. it is a great revision class.",

Just do the practice exam that he gave then you will get a good grade. <br /><br />This course has a rather small workload overall. Quite relaxing I will say. I am not a business school student, I just take it for the SA common core requirement. This course definitely worth to take it. It's much much better, useful, and more interesting than those fking boring social science courses (SOSC). If you want to fulfill the SA requirement, just take this course.

            "comment_content": "Course Description: As an introductory course (it may be your first course in economics), this course intends to coverf undamental concepts and tools that are used in microeconomic analysis. In this course, I will show you that economics provides a powerful way of thinking that can help you understand many human and social phenomena, and also enrich you in a wide range of career choices. I willuse real world examples and cases as much as possible in order to enhance your understanding of course materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, I would like all of you to come up with your own “definition” or“meaning” of economics and establish its applicability in your daily life.Textbook:“Principle of Microeconomics, Seventh edition” written by N. Gregory Mankiw, published bySouth-Western, Cengage&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplementary&nbsp;&nbsp;readings&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;be posted on the CourseWebsite (if any).Learning Outcome – School Intended Learning Outcomes (“SILOs”):1.Explain the methodology of microeconomic analysis, including key assumptions used,how economics differs from the other social science disciplines, and the strengths andlimitations of this analysis framework (SILOs # 1 and 4). 2.Describe the key concepts and tools of microeconomic analysis, such as gain from tradeand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specialization,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efficiency&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ismeasured, how the market structure affects the determination of price and quantitytransacted, and decision-making by buyers and producers under constraints (SILOs # 1, 3and 4).3.Examine the role of government and its interaction with the free market by evaluatinggovernment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impact&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justifications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgovernment intervention or participation, such as to maintain the public good (SILOs # 1,3 and 4).1<br />4.Apply economic tools and principles to identify, analyze and propose explanations forand solutions to real world issues (SILOs # 1 3 and 4). For the details of SILOs, please refer to: http://www.bm.ust.hk/sbmlearn/eng/thirdcat.php?sid=5&amp;thirdid=3Course Format / Teaching Approach:This course is delivered through lectures and tutorials.

Examinations and Grades:Quizzes and Problem sets:You will be assigned 10 quizzes and 3 problem sets during the semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quizzes (MCQsonly) are assigned on a weekly basis and submitted on the canvas. Each quiz remains activeon the canvas for one week. By default, only one attempt is allowed. Quizzes are credited bysubmissions. You have to turn in your own problem sets (hard copy) before the deadline announced.Suggested answers with detailed explanation will be posted on the Course Website after thedeadline of each problem set. Please note that NO late submissions will be accepted. In case you are sick and cannot handin Problem sets on time, please email TA before 5pm on the due date with completed2<br />problem set attached. In addition, the hard copy of your completed problem set, togetherwith a valid medical or legal document, should be submitted to TA no later than the firsttutorial following the due date. Midterm and Final Exams:There will be Two (in class) midterm exams. The midterm exam will cover lecture materials,problem sets and assigned reading (if any). The final exam is CUMULATIVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may contain multiple-choice, true &amp; false questions andessay-type questions, which require explanation in writing, graph and calculation.Overall Score of Grading for the Course:Your overall score for the course will be computed according to one of the following two schemes,whichever yields the higher score. This means that a low score in a midterm exam will not loweryour course grade, and it always makes sense to take both midterm exams. As you can see, a goodscore can raise your grade, but a low score will not lower it.Scheme (1): Course score with TWO midterms Assessment ActivitiesWeightingProblem Sets10%Quizzes10%Midterm Exam ((1) and (2))20%+20%Final exam (cumulative)40%Scheme (2): Course score with ONE midtermAssessment ActivitiesWeightingProblem Sets10%Quizzes10%Midterm Exam ((1) or (2), the higher one)30%Final exam (cumulative)50%Absence from Midterm and Final Exam:If for any reason you are unable to attend the midterm or final exam, you mustseekapproval of absence from me directly BEFORE the exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your request should be supportedby valid documents, such as medical certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner.Absence from an exam without prior approval of absence would result in ZERO score.There will be NO makeup for any Midterm exams. If you miss both midterm exams for anyreasons, you will receive ZERO for your midterm exams. For students who are absent from the final exam with prior approval, a make-up exam willbe arranged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make-up exam will be scheduled as soon as possible and should be within oneweek after the official final exam date (to be announced). It is the responsibility for thosewho request for a make-up exam to ensure their availability. The make-up arrangement canbe in&nbsp;&nbsp;the form of written-exam, oral exam or research paper, etc. Please NOTE that theinstructor has the final discretion on all arrangements of the make-up exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students whorequest for the make-up final exam should comply all the requirements as communicatedby the instructor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failing to meet any requirement may result in a ZERO score.3<br />Academic Honesty and Integrity:Academic integrity and honesty are key values at HKUST. Please read the information on academicintegrity carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is your responsibility to be familiarized with the Academic Honor Code and thecontent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ishttp://www.ust.hk/provost/integrity. The Code will be STRICTLY enforced.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will report any cases tothe University WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS.I will try my best to make the course requirements as clear as possible. When you have anyquestion or you encounter any difficulties in studying, please do not hesitate to consult me either inor out of class throughout the semester. I am delighted to help you succeed in the course. Please beaware that ultimately it is you EARNING the grade, not me GIVING you the grade. So, when thegrade is out, one thing I will NOT do is to change your grade if what you want (need) is different from what you get.Classroom Etiquette:You are expected to be punctual for both lectures and tutorials; I will start and end the lecture on time. You are welcome to bring your laptop or other devices to lectures for learning purposes. Respect the others in class and do not disturb others with side conversation, Internet surfing, emails-checking or instant-messaging during class time. No eating in class at anytime",
