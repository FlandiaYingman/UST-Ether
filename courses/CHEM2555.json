Just read through the lab manuals and watch briefing videos for each experiment.<br /><br />The e-report questions are also not hard. Mostly just copying your datasheet and some simple calculations. But the abovementioned danger of getting zero marks for not matching the marking criteria drives people to be paranoid about what they type in. And this takes up a lot of time.",
