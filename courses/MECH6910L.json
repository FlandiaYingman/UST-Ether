        "description": "Acoustics and aeroacoustics have wide engineering and scientific applications. Its use is wide spread in modern society. Flow generated sound / noise can be found on aircraft, high-speed trains, public transport, and wind noise, etc. It poses both engineering and environmental challenges. The aims of this course are to acquaint the students with an understanding of fundamental acoustics, and the theory of aerodynamically generated sound. The module will focus on the sound generated by flows, aerodynamic loading, and also highlight experimental and numerical methods of measuring aerodynamic sound. After completion of the course, the students will have in their possession necessary analytical, computational, and practical skills for further research and engineering careers.",
