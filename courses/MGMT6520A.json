        "description": "Achieving sustainability—for individuals, business and society—often requires innovations, both major and minor, in processes, products, and business models in order to optimize both financial and non-financial (i.e., ESG) outcomes. This course provides both a theoretical and applied introduction to market-based, business approaches to global challenges to sustainability, including poverty, environmental degradation, energy shortage, public health and so forth. Students will examine the way that strategies and innovations can play in relieving these pressures. Different from the Social Entrepreneurship course, this course takes the perspective of an established corporation and aims to inspire corporate initiatives for sustainability.",
