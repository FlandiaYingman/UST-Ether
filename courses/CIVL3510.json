        "description": "This course introduces basic and fundamental knowledge essential to the design and analysis of hydrosystems engineering problems (e,g., water supply, flood control, stormwater drainage, etc.). The course consists of two interrelated parts: hydrology and hydraulics. Hydrology covers various processes of water cycle (including precipitation, infiltration, rainfall-runoff modeling, and flow routings) that produce loads on hydrosystems. Hydraulics, on the other hand, applies fluid mechanics principles to the design and analysis the capacity of hydrosystems infrastructures such as pipe networks and channel networks as well as hydraulic machinery.",

To be frank, she's the worst lecturer I've ever seen (even worse than Lee Wing Lung who teaches math2350). I bet most of the students don't know what she is saying in the lectures, and therefore the attendance was really low. Instead of considering how to improve her teaching, she chose to &quot;threaten&quot; us by sending an email and bringing a name list to ask people questions WITH OUR PHOTOS ON IT!! <br /><br />To Professor Lu if you are watching this: PLEASE DON'T TEACH UNDERGRADUATE COURSES ANYMORE. JUST PLAY WITH R IN YOUR RESEARCH AND STOP CAUSING PAIN TO US.",
            "comment_grading": "Most students get similar scores in the assignments, project and take home exam, so a few percent difference in the overall score can already make a change with a few sub grades. Then there is this ONE AND ONLY &quot;bonus&quot; class quiz which we were never informed of beforehand. It can add 5% max to the overall score, so basically you're fucked up if you didn't go to attend the bonus quiz. At first she distributed the grades according to the university guidelines WITHOUT CONSIDERING HOW NARROW OUR OVERALL SCORE RANGE IS. Most of us are so pissed off that we complained to the department and luckily they conducted a grade review for all students.",
            "comment_workload": "For the hydraulics part, there are 4 group assignments which require us to find a river and do some related calculations. Koen was not helpful at all and we have to find the TAs in order to know how to finish the assignments. Most of them are very time consuming.<br /> <br />For the hydrology part, it is a total nightmare. The way how that woman designs her part is just purely awful. I don't fucking know what's the point of designing a POSTER in an engineering course. The whole purpose of doing a project is just error 404 except putting more workload on yr 3 students who are already on the brink of mental breakdown. In the end our group just handed in some shit mostly without using any specific knowledge taught specifically in this course, and finally got above mean for the project. Best joke ever. She also gave us an R assignment which is a total nightmare to us. Maybe she thought we can change from complete BEGINNERS to EXPERTS in R within a very short period of time. Unfortunately, most of us are not as genius and enlightened as she is, so I guess everyone is just &quot;making reference&quot; to the codes from each other and changing variable names.<br /><br />The final exam creates the worst nightmare I have encountered during my three years of study in HKUST. That woman said we should be able to finish it within 5 hours. In the end most of us used three days to do it. The questions are extremely troublesome and time consuming , e.g. we have to input a 10*7 matrix (which means there are 70 entries) in R. I nearly collapsed after working until 3-4 am for two consecutive nights because of this fucking piece of shit.<br /><br />To put it simple, the workload from this course is a major source of my stress in this semester, where I already have 11 fucking labs to do.<br /><br />(P.S. you may notice how many times I have used the word &quot;nightmare&quot;. I think you can already imagine how terrible this course is)",

We need to find the TAs many times in order to finish those tedious assignments.<br /><br />For Prof. Lu (Hydrology Part), as she is very erudite (Academic Role Model,GPA:3.97/4), she uses her &quot;extraordinary mind&quot; to design her very &quot;fruitful&quot; course contents for us. actually teaching for UG students before taking the attendance. Unfortunately, as most of us are not as erudite as Prof. LU , we only want to become a civil engineer and do not have the potentials to become designers, programmers or researchers, we cannot understand the painstaking efforts of Prof. LU for asking us to make a very “interesting” poster and learn those very &quot;useful&quot; R codes.",

However, after some students reflected this to the department, she changed her mind and willing to review all the grades again.",
            "comment_workload": "For hydraulics part, there are total 4 group assignments (3 people in a group). For these assignments, we have to choose a river and do calculations based all the data of this river. As we are only very humble students, we do not have any powerful computer program and cannot ask any organizations to give us any digital data, we have a hard time to find useful information in the internet. Moreover, as he did not teach us how to do all those assignments , we have to spend a lot of time to find the TA to finish the untaught assignments. (One of the assignment in this part had cost us more than “20 hours” to finish!)<br /><br />For hydrology part, there are total 2 individual assignments (a reading assignment, a R code assignment) , 3 group assignments (6 people in a group) (a poster design, a presentation and a white paper) , attend 2 library workshops a pop-up quiz in the lecture. For the reading assignment, we have to read those lengthy readings to get the answers for finishing the assignments (just like doing English reading comprehension). For the R code assignment, as we are only civil students which do not have rich knowledge in programing like our very erudite Prof. LU (Most of us only know Excel VBA), we have a hardship in understanding all those tedious R codes and need about 3 to 4 days to finish the assignment. For the group assignment, we need to choose any topic about Hydraulics or Hydrology to make a poster first. Then, we need to go to the library to participate an “academic conference”. Half of each group needs to deliver presentations to all the TAs and students in the academic conference and another half need to assess other group’s performance. As there is no guideline, we have to spend a lot of time for design the poster&nbsp;&nbsp;and organize the presentation. Finally, we have to write a white paper on the chosen topic. We need to follow rubrics similar to the LANG course for doing the white paper (I don’t know why we need to study a LANG course again and also in a more tough way as we have already passed my LANG 2030 in the previous semester). For the library workshops, they are compulsory and attendance is needed. For the pop-up quiz, it contributes much for the final grade, people who miss it may suffer from one grade down (e.g. B range to C range)<br /><br />In addition, there is a take-home final which includes the contents of both parts. As Prof LU is very &quot;talented&quot;, she said she only need 5 hours concentrated works to finish it. Unfortunately, I am only a normal student so I need to spend total 3 days to finish it. <br /><br />With all these tedious workloads, I only have a little time to spend on other courses which really affect my performances in other courses in this semester.",

            "comment_content": "This course is split into two sections. For this semester, the first half was taught by Prof. Lu and the second half by Prof. Lee.<br /><br />[Topics Covered]<br />Part One (Hydrology):<br />1. Introduction to Hydrosystems Engineering<br />2. Climate and Hydrologic Cycle<br />3. Precipitation<br />-- Quiz 1 (closed-book) --<br />4. Hydrologic Losses<br />5. Rainfall-Runoff<br />6. Routing<br />--- Midterm Exam (closed-book) ---<br />Part Two (Hydraulics):<br />1. Introduction to Hydraulic Engineering<br />2. Uniform Flow; Critical Flow and Specific Energy<br />-- Quiz 2 (open-book) --<br />3. Gradually-varied Flow<br />4. Transport and Mixing Processes<br />--- Final Exam (closed-book) ---<br /><br />The hydrology part is mostly straightforward, though you may have to memorize certain facts for the quiz and midterm. Towards the end, you will have to deal with iterative equations, so having good Excel skills is a plus (you will be asked to fill in the blanks for the midterm).<br /><br />The hydraulics part is much more difficult than the hydrology part as it relates to fluid mechanics. If you have forgotten the stuff taught in CIVL 2510, better brush up on that after the midterm!",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Lu has put a lot of effort into her PowerPoint presentations, which makes her teaching much easier to follow. At the start of the course, she mentioned that she would direct questions to random students during lecture time; those who answer a question correctly would get their grade promoted to A- if they would have otherwise gotten a B+. However, she failed to fulfill her promise that every student would be asked at least one question by the end of the course, so it was unfair to those who were unlucky.<br /><br />Prof. Lee relies heavily on his handwritten notes, though a PowerPoint is provided nonetheless. Also unlike Prof. Lu, he releases exercise questions to help students prepare for the assessments. You should pay attention to the handwritten notes as you may be examined on them, and the content may not be found in the PowerPoint nor the exercises.<br /><br />After face-to-face sessions were suspended, Prof. Lee remained on schedule by uploading video recordings of his lectures and conducting live tutorials online. The quiz and final exam were also conducted online.",
            "comment_grading": "The two quizzes cover the first half of the hydrology and hydraulic parts respectively.<br /><br />The exams are non-cumulative, meaning that the midterm only covers the hydrology part, while the final exam only covers the hydraulic part. However, the final exam has almost double the weight compared to the midterm, so the second half of the course is more important to your grades.<br /><br />As mentioned in the Teaching section, students who answer Prof. Lu's questions correctly would get their grade promoted to A- (without affecting the grades of other students) if they would have otherwise gotten a B+.<br /><br />[Grading Scheme]<br />Quizzes: 20%<br />Midterm Exam: 30%<br />Final Exam: 50%<br /><br />[My Grades (20th, 50th, 80th Percentile)]<br />Quiz 1: 94/100 (50, 61, 70)<br />Midterm: 91/100 (68, 80, 92)<br />Quiz 2: 70/100 (57, 76, 85)<br />Final Exam: 67/100 (?, 62, ?)<br />Overall: 77.2% (?, 68.7%, ?)<br />Did not answer any question from Prof. Lu.<br /><br />Even though I messed up on the second part, I still got an A- without Prof. Lu's help. This is one of the best gradings I have ever experienced - I doubt that I even got 1 SD above mean.",

For hydrology taught by Professor Lu, topics include hydrological cycle, hydrographs, infiltration model, and routing. After midterm, the course is taught by Professor Lee. Hydraulic part includes open channel flow and GVF.<br /><br />Because of the research area of Professor Lee, environmental hydraulics is included at the last two weeks. This part is difficult conceptually, as PDE stuffs started to appear(though the questions are not hard). However, I think this is the most interesting part in the whole course.<br /><br />Overall speaking, the first half is not difficult and the second half is a nightmare since concept from fluid mechanics will applied over and over. Moreover, the content is a bit too much, since hydraulic part is simply in a rush.",

            "comment_content": "The content was quite interesting and covered both hydraulics and hydrology. The lecture content covered a lot more than what was required for the exam, and there is a lot of optional background reading if a student is interested in a particular topic.",
            "comment_teaching": "Unfortunately, the professor (A. Jayawardena) made minimal attempts at making the lecture engaging during the whole semester. At the beginning, he simply read aloud word documents with plain text. After some feedback from students sitting in the front rows, he copied and pasted these word documents into powerpoint slides, however, it was often still monotonously read aloud during the lectures. He is, however, happy to answer questions and to talk with students after class, although the vast majority of students quickly got bored of his teaching and never came to class.<br />It was only at the end of the semester, when he taught 2 lectures which were not included in the final exam, that the teaching became more engaging and he showed more images and supplementary material in class.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading was quite lenient, as the Professor made the midterm practically the same as the homework he had previously assigned. The final was relatively ok - and it was open book - so as long as you were familiar with where to look for content during the exam (there are a lot of lecture notes that you can print), then you would have done ok.",
            "comment_workload": "If you wanted to follow the lectures and actually understand the material taught, then you would have to put in quite a lot of self-studying time. However, if you want to purely pass the course with minimal studying, it is very much doable as there is only a few small assignments, along with open book midterm and final exams.",
