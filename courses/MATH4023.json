He designed lecture slides per lecture and completed the scheduled content perfectly. Unlike some professors who copied the textbook as powerpoint and not willing to share them freely (well, sharing them is meaningless anyway), he shared the well-designed lecture slides after lecture so that I can follow through the content with it when I watch the lecture video.",
            "comment_grading": "10+4% from hw, 30% midterm, 60% final. <br /><br />Before releasing grade distribution, I personally don't think the grading scheme is good, because there is no all-in-final option for this course, while most of the courses I took in this semester offer such choice. <br /><br />However, my mind changed after releasing grade distribution - With absolute grading scheme (my guess based on distribution), an overall score of 75% is already enough for A range, and 50-75% for B range, 25-50% for C range and so on. I guess you are already safe for getting B or B+ if you only know how to do all the computational problems, plus one or two proof problems! <br /><br />But of course the most beautiful content in complex analysis is the neat analytic, algebraic and topological properties! Therefore I think it successfully distinguishes A range and B range candidates, depending on how many proofs you can successfully work on.",

Our class probably had many IRE/PMA students together with many weaker students, so Henry has made the content flexible by including some supplementary notes apart from his lecture notes. These supplementary notes were optional readings, many of them are for stronger students who want to learn more and deeper about the topics, while some of them are for weaker students (to learn about limsup and liminf for example, although I already learnt it in 3033). I think he has done well in making the content balanced between being suitable for strong and weak students.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think chapter 4 (consequences of the Cauchy integral formula) is the most beautiful and also the most challenging part of the course (excluding Ch 6 which was not tested). Many properties of holomorphic functions, that are different from differentiable real functions, follow from the Cauchy integral formula. It is challenging because when doing the exercise we need to distinguish among all these properties which ones are more suitable to be applied.",

He uploads his lecture notes chapter by chapter before classes, leaving some blanks in examples for us to fill in during the class. If you don't want to copy, you can still get the answers to the blanks because he will update his notes after every class. Although the lecture notes are already nicely written, I still attended classes because he will usually explain the motivation behind definitions and proofs in lecture, before writing them down. I think these motivations and explanations are the things that worth to copy, rather than the blanks. Like in the other review, the slides he prepared are also very useful when you view the lecture recordings again while studying.<br /><br />His lectures sometimes overrun a bit (about 5-7 minutes), but it was not a big problem in zoom classes because we don't need much time to switch to the next class.<br /><br />Henry is also responsive to questions asked in emails (he even responds to ig dm haha)",
