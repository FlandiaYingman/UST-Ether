Thus, for students who really can't wake up early for lesson would be a pain to take this course. (of course, it may be different for other semesters.)<br /><br />As the quizzes and final exam dry run are on lesson time, this means that, technically, you may consider that the attendance to lectures technically takes 92% of the grade, where the lectures with quizzes/final dry run take more weighting.<br />(Note: Not taking the final exam dry run this semester will cause your final exam score to become 0!)<br /><br />Other than that, the homework, quizzes and final exam are pretty much okay. Quizzes and final exam is open book, and even allows usage of advanced calculators such as WolframAlpha.<br /><br />For homework, I must say that it is good enough, and they are lenient on the homework grading. I remember that in HW4, I stated a wrong expected value in a question (with signs flipped), and at last come up with a wrong answer. However, the TA marking my homework still takes it as correct.<br /><br />For the final exam, they do not provide us with any past papers. However, I strongly advise finding and download the past papers by yourself.<br />(Edit: According to the school announcement recently, since the next semester will resume the F2F mode, the final exam may get a new pattern, i.e. different from the past papers. Even so, I still recommend finding past papers to get an understanding of how they will ask the questions.)",
