        "description": "This course is on the study of the Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces. It uses the\nbook by Zhenbo Qin. We will study the basic knowledge of Hilbert schemes, Nakajima's work on Hilbert schemes. If time permits, we will also study the cohomology ring structure of Hilbert schemes. The student will meet the instructor at least once a week to present the materials and discuss with the instructor on the materials. The student should seek the instructor's approval to take this course.",
