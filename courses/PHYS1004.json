        "description": "Who are scientists? What are these people and how do they think? Is there any fundamental contradiction between science and religion? Is there a \"human\" side of science? These are the questions we intend to discuss in this course. The course starts with an introduction to the principle of falsifiability, and the importance of precise measurement in science. These principles are then illustrated using several historical examples in science and social science. The relation between science, humanity and society will be discussed afterward. Group project(s) and presentations are required throughout the course.",
