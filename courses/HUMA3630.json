            "comment_content": "The course is a introduction to Anthropology. If you are interested in that, you will find this course is quite interesting since you will learn the research methods and many related concepts. Since there are no examinations, what you learn from class do not exert a great impact on your performance. Also, the reading materials are just for reference, you don't have to read them. To conclude, this course creates a &quot;very free&quot; learning atmosphere.<br /><br />Instead of cramming you with tons of subject knowledge, this course encourages you to learn by exploring. You will be given 2 group research projects and 1 field trip report (individual) to do. The aim of the first project is to let you taste how to conduct a research like an anthropologist. Hence, we were assigned to conduct a research about one student society in HKUST, then do a presentation. After having the first taste, the difficulty of the second one is higher. You can freely choose a community in Hong Kong to study, then make a presentation and a group paper (12-15 pages in total, which is quite easy for a group of four students). <br />You are also required to attend at least one field trip organized by the （UST）South China Research Center, for example, Jiao Festival（太平清醮）.<br /><br />Overall, this course is quite relaxing. It's even an enjoyment for those who love hands-on experience.<br /><br />（By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;the majority of the students are international students（including exchange students）（I don't know whether it is coincidence）)",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr.Qiu does not speak very fluent English, but it does not affect your understanding of the content. Also, she often looks at the computer or her notes while she is teaching （I guess that is because her spoken English is not very good, she just wants to make sure she does not speak anything wrong）. Hence, there are many students feel bored during classes.<br /><br />However, she is definitely a sincere teacher. Although she won't create any quizzes for what she has taught, she still pays lots of effort on the course content （e.g. using various examples）.<br /><br />Also, she does care students. Before the first tutorial, every student was asked to prepare a brief introduction of his or her cultural background. She memorized all! She often asks the cultural experience of some students base on their characteristics and background. For example, when we are talking about the life in student hall, she may &quot;interview&quot; students from foreign countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;（This is quite nice). She is also quite acceptive. One of our students was not available to do the presentation, she allowed him to make a video. If you find it difficult to do your presentation on the designated date, you could talk to her and postpone your presentation （if no time clash）. Also, the deadline for submitting the final paper is quite late （the last day of examination）.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Besides, the learning atmosphere she creates is quite relaxing. For example, there's a group providing snacks to the audience during the presentation. She's chilled with that.<br /><br />In conclusion, she seems not very good at giving a lecture, but she is extremely nice,&nbsp;&nbsp;considerate and supportive.",

One thing I really do not like about is that he always makes amendment to the course assignment (the learning portfolio) without making announcements, which makes it inflexible for students who already started doing the work.<br />He can memorize students' names and faces well, so if you do not attend a lecture, he will know that (and will send an email to you).",
