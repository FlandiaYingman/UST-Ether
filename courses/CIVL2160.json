His teaching is mildly interesting with somewhat nonsense random jokes, but considering it’s his first time teaching the course it’s more than acceptable. A very vibrant and passionate professor I would say.<br />The second half of the course was where the real “fun” begins. thomas hu was of stark contrast to prof Anthony as he is boring and indifferent towards teaching the course. The only reason of him teaching the course was to hard sell us the TI graphical calculator,whom the distributor he have affiliation with. During lectures, he rarely touches on the actual course content, but spend most of his time shit talking about his “memories “ with another now deceased professor. All u will learn in his lectures is to use that calculator, rather than the principle behind those calculations.",

            "comment_content": "The content covered in the Statistics part taught by Thomas Hu was slightly reduced due to the unprecedented social unrest. For Anthony's part, topics about probability were just the same as last year. The course focused on applications in different civil engineering disciplines more than mathematical deductions and theories. <br /><br />PART I Probability taught by Prof Anthony (Week 1-5)<br />1. Uncertainty in Engineering <br />2. Fundamental Probability Concepts (Set Theory, Venn Diagram, Union and Intersection, basic operations, Mutually Exclusive and collectively exhaustive events, statistical independence, conditional prob, theorem of total prob)<br />3. Bayes' Theorem <br />4. Expectation, Variance, SD, cov, Mean, Mode,Median, PDF, PMF CDF etc.<br />5. Continuous random variables and distributions (Normal, Lognormal, Exponential) <br />6. Discrete random variables and distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Poisson, return period)<br />7.Joint PMF, choice of probability model(use of probability paper, goodness of fit using chi-square test)<br />8. Function of RV and reliability calculations <br /><br />PART II Statistics taught by Thomas Hu (Week 7-13)<br />1. CLT, sampling distributions, estimating population proportion and population mean, confidence intervals, t-distribution<br />2. Regression and correlation analysis <br />Least-square matrix formulation and calculator applications <br /><br />Note that topics like Monte Carlo Simulation,Bayesian Approach, <br />Hypothesis Testing, Decision Analysis etc were omitted this semester. So the topics covered by Thomas Hu were greatly reduced but these are the key topics which should be addressed according to the original schedule. It was a bad news if you really want to learn statistics in detail and made good use of such concepts in other disciplinary applications like hydrology, transportation engineering etc. <br /><br />I think M1 students should have some advantages in this course since all the topics covered in M1 appeared again and you should pick up easily comparing to other students although there were new concepts in later topics in Part I and regression in Part II.<br /><br /><br />結論： Anthony 比 Thomas Hu 好得多 <br /><br /><br />Thomas Hu D 堂真係好悶又無重點 Notes 將Concepts求其Address下感 無足夠Explanation Examples D 難度同形式極奇呢唔常見 得閑上到悶就Hea 我地走去放Break D 課題已經相對比之前難搞 簡直慘不忍睹 <br /><br />奉勸大家 Thomas Hu 不可再 Elective Courses 都最好避開",
            "comment_teaching": "Part I Probability (Week 1 to 5)<br /><br />Anthony's lectures were relaxing and sometimes with fun. A friendly and approachable professor. He prepared power-point slides for each topics and uploaded before lectures. He generally used the visualizer to address the concepts and examples covered in the slides and adopted chalk &amp; talk teaching approach with quite clear explanations and visualizations. I think students should come to his lectures since he explained the things quite well and some topics like chi-square test and usage of probability paper, he did demonstrate with examples in a step-by-step approach. And indeed, the midterm did consist a question about this topic ! But the assignment problems didn't require plotting but the exam did require! So pay attention! <br /><br />Generally I think the examples given in lectures were not the advanced one so maybe check out from the textbook for more complex and detailed examples with additional self practices given. <br /><br />For tutorials, the two TAs Annie and Charlie were responsible. Annie conducted the first three tutorials with some concepts review and basic examples given. <br /><br />Charlie then conducted the following three tutorials. He is a Mainland student with some accent, funny but understandable. He provided some more advanced examples with concept reviews. He demonstrated how to use the probability paper and conducting chi-square test in Week 6' tutorial which was quite essential and useful for exam preparation. The other tutorials he eventually gave some long and detail demonstrations of examples on function of RV and probability distributions. <br />One funny thing is once a student asked him how to formulate Power Series for a Poisson distribution problem he just opened Symbol-lab to demonstrate and everyone was teasing. But eventually next tutorial he managed to clarify our doubts so not bad at all. <br /><br />For Week 6 lectures, the two TAs spent the lecture time to demonstrate additional examples in order to prepare for the midterm in Week 8. <br /><br />For Part I, I would give a B grade. <br /><br />Part II Statistics&nbsp;&nbsp;(A great dependence on graphing calculator) <br /><br />Thomas Hu' teaching was a nightmare. He was boring and indifferent to his lectures. He spent the lecture time mostly on the graphing calculator to hard-sell us how the calculator reduces calculation time. He spent very limited time addressing the concepts, reading out loud the lecture slides and drawing on the slides with disgusting handwriting, which is not appreciated and eventually not a lot of students came to his classes compared to Anthony's one especially when the lectures started at early 9 am with most students falling asleep. <br /><br />It was like if we fail to manage how to operate the graphing calculator, we will fail to work on the problems which are out of reality and weird. So the first thing to learn from Thomas' lectures is to know how to use the functions in the calculators and the programming steps, i.e. plugging calculators in order to become a &quot;master&quot; .Yet the calculator can reduce calculation time, however in reality, students didn't learn much from the concepts. Such an approach should not be encouraged in engineering education. I wondered why he managed to receive the Common Core Excellence Award last year with such tedious teaching manner. <br /><br />The calculator should serve as an aid but not a must or reliance for learning purpose. Concepts learning and applications with engineering context should always come first. And the fact is that we have to return the calculator after course completion. Thomas claimed that he paid for hundreds of calculators with limited financial assistance from the department and each calculator cost ~$1200 which is crazily expensive and not economically affordable for most students. The calculator functions indeed can be operated on personal notebooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />One thing to add is Thomas Hu spent some of the lecture time recalling the past &quot;great&quot; memories of a decedent, Prof. Wilson Tang, praising himself that he spent the great time with the Professor working on the editing of textbook and how superb the calculator operations are, and imagine how the professor would appreciate his way of teaching in heaven.<br /><br />He omitted a whole bunch of topics this semester but failed to upload the respective slides for self-study. What a shame in consideration of learning and explorations of statistical applications. <br /><br />For the tutorials, I didn't attend so I can't judge the performance of TA Zhihao. But all the TAs will eventually upload the tutorial notes on Canvas.<br /><br />For Part II, I would give a D grade.",
            "comment_grading": "Each part contributes 50% of the course grade respectively. See below. <br /><br />Part I 50%<br />Assignments x2 15%<br />Mid-term 35% <br /><br />The two assignments consist of several long questions which were not too difficult to be done. Most people scored high marks. <br /><br />For midterm, it consisted of four long questions with sub-questions, 2 hrs were given for completion.<br /><br />Q1 20 marks <br />Exponential distribution to find mean and variance, normal distribution to find required probability, return period etc,<br /><br />Q2 30 marks Antenna Problem <br />Poisson distribution , baye's theorem, cond. prob, total prob. thm <br /><br />Q3 30 marks (Moment problem need simple statics knowledge)<br />Function of RV for answer set-up <br />Probability distributions and calculations <br /><br />Q4 20 marks (play with your FX50FH/3650p, plugging numbers and sequencing frequently, need good eye sight when plotting the paper and drawing the best fit line to obtain slope and intercept) <br /><br />Choice of probability model using probability paper <br />Conduct chi-square test to evaluate goodness of fit and check Z-value from table and make good use of degree of freedom! <br /><br />I think Q2 was the most difficult question which required more thinking and using the venn diagram for better clarification , Q1 and Q3 were not too difficult. Q4 required more patience during calculations and I wondered why people said steps in Q4 were harsh?! Just a bit clumsy but manageable ! <br /><br />Score Distribution out of 165 students <br />Mean 65.5 <br />SD 15.0<br />Median 68 <br />Max 98 (crazy guy, the second highest score was already 90)<br />Min 28 <br /><br />Most people scored between 65 to 75. <br /><br /><br />Part II 50% <br />Quiz 15% (but cancelled finally) <br />Final Exam 35% (eventually changed to 50% due to&nbsp;&nbsp;quiz cancellation) <br /><br />Due to class suspension, topics covered in final were greatly reduced comparing to previous semester. You just needed to score 40 then the whole 50% score will be guaranteed and automatically transferred. So probably this semester, the performance of mid-term decided your fate and your grade. <br /> <br />Final included 40 MCs/ True or False with two hours given which was quite sufficient. The essence of final exam was to know how to operate the graphing calculator efficiently and precisely. Making good use of the calculator can reduce some time for clumsy calculations for regression analysis and probability checking from Normal Distribution and t-distribution tables. <br /><br />Note that two questions scored 12 marks respectively and the other 38 questions scored 2 marks respectively. But the 12 marks questions were not too difficult indeed ...... <br /><br />Score Distribution <br />Mean 68.6<br />SD 16.0<br />Median 68<br />Max 100<br />Min 0 <br />(6 students scored below 40 and are required to resit the final)<br /><br />Personal score <br />Midterm 79/100<br />Final 90/100 <br />Assignments x2 100/100 90/100 <br /><br />Grade A-&nbsp;&nbsp;(just standard grading)",
            "comment_workload": "The main workload this semester were generally came from Prof Anthony's part. He provided two assignments(just a few long questions) which were just the same as last year. Apart from that, you just need to do regular revision of the lecture notes and tutorial examples and find some self-practice from the reference textbook (Probability Concepts in Engineering - Emphasis on Applications to Civil and Environmental Engineering) for better understanding and consolidations with detail examples. <br /><br />For Thomas part, the workload was pretty low. Just need to revise his notes and learn how to use the &quot;superior&quot; graphing calculator efficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp;Find some self practices yourself for better consolidations and training.",

I hope u could read to know:<br /><br />1)his tutors didn't check the paper well.<br />they give me a wrong evaluation 2 times. Every time I must check the paper 3times before I report my case to them.<br />In fact, they don't know how to use a calculator. they can sum up the wrong marks 2 times. If I didn't check my paper well, I would lose about 15 marks(it is about 1SD I think. the total marks is 115)<br /><br />2)this course attendance is of 2% marks.<br />however, he never take attendance.<br />In the last lesson, one student reminds him of this thing, then he goes to take attendance. You are not blind. just take attendance one times, then you can get all 2%.<br />If you are busy and hv no time to attend the course at that time, then u will lose it.<br />佢用一張紙比所有學生去take attendance,有出席ge 就自己去寫低個名,但係佢唔會理你寫幾耐,你可以寫十分鐘,可以寫十幾個名,幫frds take attendance.即使佢知都唔會理你<br />More ridiculously,he just uses a paper to take attendance.students leave their name on it=take attendance. He allows students &quot;help&quot; friends take attendance, no matter whether his friends attend the course or not.<br /><br />3)he recommend us to buy a calculator at HKD$1200. and said that we could use it in the exams.BUT no questions are complicated. the calculators are of no use in this exam.Why do I need to buy this calculator? My family is very poor.I need to work three days every week. Why do I buy this useless calculator?",

He is quite passionate and talkative. He is quite friendly and sometimes chats with us. <br /><br />However, I personally think he should post the lecture slides before a day of teaching, since I think there is not much difference between listening to his teaching and reading the lecture slides by ourselves. Besides, there were some mistakes in the lecture slides and he updated it repeatedly, and we had to find where he updated it. Several slides were even updated before the day of midterm, which I think it is not appropriate. <br /><br />For Thomas, he can either be good or bad in different perspectives. For the good perspective, he teaches us in a very very casual way (as how he dresses up like having a holiday), he sometimes makes jokes in Cantonese (though I don't find it funny)...He tells the students who attend the lecture that which pages he will skip and questions that may examined; He also changes the quizzes (which originally will be tested in tutorial sessions) to take-home quiz, i.e. HWs.<br /><br />For the bad perspective, he DOES NOT change his way of teaching and the exam. He forces every students learn to use the Ti-CAS calculator to do the HW &amp; the exam requires a handheld calculator. Many students do not have enough time to practice on the handheld. Even though there is a 30-day trial of Ti-CAS software and handheld sessions, it is still not enough to get used to using the calculator...<br />Besides, as Thomas did not have enough calculator for everyone, he had to divide the paper into two parts (CAS-based &amp; Non-CAS-based), and he collected the calculator for another 40-50 students in other room.
