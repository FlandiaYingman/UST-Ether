            "comment_teaching": "Clearly, he does not know how to teach. He keeps jumping lecture notes back and forth and there is no logic in his teaching. He often forgets to record the lecture but always remembers to ask students to turn on their cameras. He will not start the lecture until everyone turns on their cameras. He never replies to students' emails after the class. <br /><br />The TA Yu Jun needs to learn how to send emails correctly. His email about the final exam somehow goes into the junk box.",

Initially, we were told we would have a group project. But he changed it to an individual project at the last minute. <br /><br />The final exam was 3 hrs in the Final Exam Schedule on the university website. He changed it to 2h30min in the last lecture and he again changed it to 2hrs one week before the exam to make sure students do not have enough time to answer all questions.",
