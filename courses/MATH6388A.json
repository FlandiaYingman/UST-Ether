        "description": "This course covers basic numerical methods in the graduate level. The main themes \nare numerical solutions of PDEs and numerical methods for eigenvalue problems. For numerical solutions of PDEs, some basic theories of finite difference methods for hyperbolic equations are discussed. The topics include stability, order of accuracy, consistency, Lax-equivalence theorem, multistep methods, dissipation and \ndispersion, system of equations in higher dimensions, splitting schemes. For numerical methods for eigenvalue problems, the topics include the Gershgorin theorem, power iteration, inverse power iteration, Householder and Givens matrices, \nQR factorization, QR algorithm, singular value decomposition, principle component analysis, rank deficient problems, regularization techniques.",
