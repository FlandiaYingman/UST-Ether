Presentation of basic facts about history, geography, population, political system etc, combined with a survey of elementary background materials on Judaism and Zionism, and analysis of a sample of social, political and cultural issues, like: young nation-state and old religion and peoplehood; democracy and national security in a protracted armed conflict; church and state in Israel; controversial borders and settlements in Palestinian territories; immigration, ethnic cleavages and multi-culturalism; Western-European orientation vs. Asian Middle Eastern one; Ultra-Orthodoxy; Israeli Arabs; Kibutz; Holocaust; Jerusalem; the Bible in contemporary Israel; militarism in Israel; and more. Israel's fundamental dilemmas will be addressed, e.g. is it a Jewish state or liberal-democratic state, or, is there such thing as \"Israeli society\" or is it just a conglomeration of many \"tribes\", or, Israel, Globalism and localism. Frontal lectures + discussions + documentary and fiction films.",
