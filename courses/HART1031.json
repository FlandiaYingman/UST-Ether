        "description": "Documentary Theatre is created based on real life stories such as personal experiences, social issues or historical events. Primary documentary materials including recorded interviews, newspaper articles, video footages or photographs will be interpreted and composed to create a theatrical representation of the events. Unlike written texts or edited films, Documentary Theatre offers a multi-perspective and three-dimensional way into understanding real life experiences in depth through live performances by performers making use of different dramatic expressive means. In this course, students will explore different models of documentary theatre, focusing on the relationship amongst the form, the purpose and the content. Students will also have the opportunity to choose a local issue or community of their own interest, conduct face-to-face interviews, interpret and edit the collected data, create a dramatic structure from the research materials, devise an original piece of documentary theatre, and give a performance at the end of the course.",
