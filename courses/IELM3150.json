Lab teaching is also poor; the TA explicitly said he received little help when he was a student learning this material, so he wanted our class to have the same experience... instead of helping us. As our lab instructor.",

Go to class my dudes",

Grading is tough, as the course is tough (or maybe I'm dumb)<br /><br />40% lab + project work, optional 5% participation, 25% * 2 exams, remainder homework. Exams are closed book, expect at least one quantitative Q (mechanics related, usually), two hours, non-cumulative, work through the Qs quickly because there are a lot of them<br /><br />Ajay says to understand and appreciate things conceptually, but that's not enough. TA and prof both perceive course contents to be easy, maybe that is the case, but exams are hard... (again, could just be my stupidity)<br /><br />Even though less than 10 students take the course, it's not an easy grade ;(",
