        "description": "This course introduces basic concepts, tools and techniques for modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems. The course starts from the use of differential equations to model continuous time systems. Examples from a variety of Electronic and Computer Engineering disciplines will be given to illustrate the modeling process. Then, basic tools needed for analyzing the behavior of dynamical systems will be presented. Finally, techniques for controlling their behavior will be introduced. Throughout the course, laboratory experiments demonstrating the use of these analysis/design tools will be included.",

The final letter grade results in an A. <br /><br />IF YOU STRUGGLE FOR AN A+. PLEASE CONSIDERING Prof. SHI's TEACHING. HE GIVES A+ GENEROUSLY.<br /><br />You cannot make a single mistake in this course. Or you will not get an A+ finally.

So, it is a 4 credits course without a lab session. It can be a relatively light workload compared to other ELEC 3000-level courses. <br /><br />If you want to attend the lab sessions, it is around the end of the semester in week 9 and week 11. The lab is about how to stabilize the pendulum.<br /><br />A suggestion: You can self-study this course, which is a way easier to get the knowledge you should have known in exams. If you cannot understand, please just go to TAs and Prof. to ask questions. It is a waste of time if you are in year 3 or year 4.<br />IT IS ONLY WORTH IT FOR SELF-STUDY!!!",

            "comment_content": "This is a broad elective from the ELEC 3000 series (which you may have realised coz of all the prerequisites for this course).<br /><br />This course involves a lot of calculations requiring skills from solving differential equation sets to Laplace Transform to calculating signal NORM. (it's nothing really, coz in the exam you are allowed to use MATLAB to solve pretty much everything.)<br /><br />Majority of the course is on finding overall system transfer functions and relationships between system variables &amp; coefficients. Optimization was taught mostly in the last part but is also involved in the 1st &amp; 2nd labs so its advised to really read through the content and get to know what you are about to handle. <br /><br />If your mathematics / logic skills are not that good, or you seldom attend classes,&nbsp;&nbsp;DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.",
            "comment_teaching": "I am sure Prof QIU is professionally qualified in teaching system control, I mean he wrote the course textbook himself, but I must stress that THE COURSE ORGANIZATION IS JUST ABYSMAL. <br /><br />The lab schedule was not released right until after add-drop period so we couldn't properly plan our timetables. Of course when it was released, BOOM, all classes clashed.<br />The professors' argument was if they put up the lab schedule early, students would be reluctant to join the course coz of the 3 hour lab period. I mean WTF, students will not join a course depending on how long the lab is , we've been through 2200 and 2400 we are accustomed to 3 hr lab sessions. Get to grip man.<br />OH, AND BEST OF ALL, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE LAB SESSIONS, WE DONT HAVE TUTORIAL SESSIONS.",

If you know the concept it is quite simple, however if youre not particularly good in MATLAB that's another story.<br /><br />Overall, the concepts taught in this course requires time to digest.",
