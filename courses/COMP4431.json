The first lecture was a video lecture that covers 2 to 3 topics each time. Gibson recorded videos and uploaded to the official site. We had to watch these videos and then answer some questions on Canvas (to gain participation scores). The second lecture was an activity lecture. Gibson wouldn't teach new things but would have pop quizzes during lessons. Again we had to answer the questions on Canvas to gain the participation scores.<br /><br />8 labs, 1 lab for MIDI, 3 labs for audio, 3 labs for image and 1 lab for video. Lab attendance was not necessary. All lab work was programming. The necessary tools for me were just Chrome and VS Code. Not hard.<br /><br />The project was done in group. Gibson provided a list of topics (about MIDI, audio, image and video). We needed to choose 1 from them and then built it.<br /><br />The final online exam was open-book but quite hard.",

            "comment_content": "This is a course to teach you how to process audio, image and video in a digital way. You also need a few skills on JavaScript and HTML (not that demanding like COMP4021). Dave's MOOC notes and videos will be provided for self-studying so you don't actually need to take COMP4021 as well. As a 4000-level course, this is definitely academically easier than others. <br /><br />The course contents can be divided into mainly 5(/6?) parts:<br />0. Basics<br />- HTML and JavaScript<br />- Multimedia Representation - Sampling and Quantization<br /><br />1. MIDI<br />- MIDI features and controls<br /><br />2. Audio<br />- Basic Waveform Generation and Frequency Domain<br />- Sound Generations (Additive Synthesis/Frequency Modulation)<br />- Post-processing effects (Reversal/Amplitude control/Tremolo/etc.)<br />- Echo and Reverberation<br />- Karplus-Strong Algorithm<br />- MIDI and Music synthesis<br /><br />3. Images<br />- Colors (RGB/CMYK/HSV)<br />- Monadic image processing (Negation/Grayscale/etc.)<br />- Image Dithering<br />- Histogram processing<br />- Local operations (Blur/Edge/Sharpening)<br />- Kuwahara Filter<br /><br />4. Video<br />- Video processing (Reverse/Transitions/Motion blur)<br />- Motion Tracking and Shaking Camera Removal<br />- Chroma Key Effect (something like green screen)<br /><br />5. Compression<br />- Lossless/Lossy Audio compression<br />- Lossless/Lossy Image compression<br />- (Lossy) Video compression<br /><br />For the Labs, each part will have a set of lab(s). <br />The first Lab 0 is self-studying lab for HTML and JavaScript with nothing to do and submit. <br />Lab 1 is about MIDI, which requires to make a MIDI keyboards.<br />Lab 2, 3, 4 are about Audio which are done on the same materials. Lab 2 is basic audio generation, Lab 3 adds post-processing effects and sound generation, and Lab 4 adds more post-processing effects and Karplus-Strong Algorithm.<br />Lab 5, 6, 7 are about Image which are also done on the same materials. Lab 5 is about basic processing and comic color, Lab 6 adds dithering features and histogram handling, while Lab 7 adds filtering (e.g. blur).<br />Lab 8 is about Video, which needs us to implement certain processing effects.<br /><br />There are also a mini group project to do, which is an extension to the Lab work. You can choose 1 of the 4 Labs to work with, and various features for each topic could be chosen. Some projects requires only 2 people, while others need 3 people. <br /><br />Overall, the contents are very ordered and well-organized, so that you won't get lost when you are learning or reviewing. The contents are not very challenging, yet interesting to learn. <br />While doing the lab works, you would also find it funny and relaxing to apply the effects and see the results. I would say this course is not boring at all!",
            "comment_teaching": "[Warning: Spring 2020 is conducted in online lecture mode, so some of the reviews might not be applicable afterwards]<br /><br />Gibson is quite enthusiastic at teaching, right? You should know his style of teaching if you have taken 1000-level course from him. 喼神喎。<br /><br />Originally we had Mon and Wed lectures. However, this semester the course is switched to blended learning mode. <br /><br />On weekend the materials and (pre-recorded) lecture videos of next week will be released. There are video questions to answer, in which you need to watch lecture videos to answer, because sometimes Gibson just asked some silly questions which are related to things only appear in the video. <br />Each question is worth 1 point of that week. Sometimes the videos could be as long as 1 hour. This is tiring but the explanations are very clear.<br /><br />There will be no Lecture on Monday, and Wednesday lecture becomes activity lecture. Gibson will make some review, and ask pop quizzes related to materials that week. <br />These questions would be similar to the materials, or somehow extensions on the contents. Each pop quiz question is worth 2 points, while survey (don't care about correctness) is 1 point.<br /><br />Labs are using pre-recorded video (also by Gibson) and lab page. Most of the steps are easy to follow and implement, while some harder parts require you to think and code by yourself. <br /><br />Actually Gibson did a great job to explain contents. The flow is fluent and clear. Of course the notes are very clean and easy to follow, which is the same as those 1000-level courses. You should take it if you want a high-quality teaching.",

Learn how an echo works as well as tremolo,pitch trimming and magnification and other things in this area.<br /><br />3) Video Processing: Really combines part 1 and 2 together, mainly focussing on effecient ways to apply image or sound processing techniques to multiple frames. Also includes how to detect moving frames and correct them as well as how to select certain important frames based on how much changes happens.",

It is almost exclusively the professor talking to students using the powerpoints. There is no interaction in the form of questions or quizzes, which I personally like.",

            "comment_grading": "Gibson is lenient in grading. Getting a nearly above mean score in final exam still worth for a B grade :D<br /><br />Grading scheme:<br />10% Participation (Canvas Pop quiz and lecture video quiz)<br />30% Lab (Easy as Gibson will give you lab video to explain what you need to do in the code. Not difficult at all)<br />20% Mini Project (2-3 people in a group)<br />40% Final Exam<br /><br />You can expect that participation and lab will have very high mean score. <br />For the mean of mini project is around 17.5/20<br />For the mean of final exam is around 59/100",
            "comment_workload": "Weekly workload is just the lecture video and the lab. You can spend 1-2 hrs to finish the lecture video and 1 hr for the lab, which is not a high workload.<br /><br />Major workload comes from the mini project. You need to choose a predefined topic from Gibson (or you can self-declare your topic to Gibson for approval which is okay) and finish it in a group of 2-3. The project is basically based on the previous lab you have done. Your job is to add some features to it which are also related to lecture contents. The project requires Javascript coding so you may need to learn a bit of it before starting the project.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who are interested in Multimedia.",
