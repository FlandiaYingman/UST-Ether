From what I observed in the class, most of the students are year 1 mainland and IRE students with very strong mathematical background, they are all very smart. Students who take 2023 in year 1 Spring are all elites. <br /><br />(Reminder for ECOF students, if you are thinking whether to take this course for whatever reasons, better don’t take this course, and don’t listen to what prof LSF said. According to prof LSF, students cannot get good grade in 3113 without 2174/2023. However, 3113 only uses the knowledge of lagrange and partial D, but in 2023 you need to learn TONS of new maths...

Theorem statements/ examples and exercise solutions are provided and I think they are intelligible enough to students within 1-2 hours of digesting each.<br /><br />Compared to the (boring, I am sorry) classes I've attended in MATH 1013/14 last year, this math course is definitely much more engaging and meaningful!

I spent ~1.5 hours for each piece of the homework for the last few pieces as they could be a bit hard to solve when you're still not yet familiarised with the items taught.<br /><br />TA provides notes and exercises for each of the topics taught; though those pieces of exercises are optional, I STRONGLY advise anyone taking MATH 2023 to go over them and summarize the strategies required to solve the questions - to get what the theorems or proofs mean.<br />Spoilers (sorry): there were on average 30-50 questions on each (of the 12) tutorial notes and they usually take a few hours to complete - to get yourself reasonably equipped and perform well in your assessments, some hard work is definitely expected...<br /><br />There are also optional &quot;exercises for students&quot; made by Jimmy himself, with more challenging questions featured. If you want to get a good grade, at least try going over the suggested (underlined by him) ones as they really do provoke your thoughts rather than being merely &quot;train-up&quot; materials.<br /><br />After all, this is a 4-credit course so you should expect some workload...",

Before mid-term, the content will be mainly about vectors, parametrization, partial derivatives and finding extrema. After mid-term, the focus would be on integrals and characterization of conservative vector fields. The final exam is cumulative, but chapters 5 and 6 take up a significantly greater proportion in the final exam paper. Chapter 7 is not covered in the exams and is for leisure reading only. Henry held a lecture after the end of the semester but before exams to go through this chapter, to satisfy our curiosity.<br />(I think our class is targeted at non-MATH-major people, so I guess Henry put more emphasis on application than proofs in his teaching as compared to the other class. The two classes have different test papers too.)",
            "comment_teaching": "May as well give an S here if I can since Henry is probably one of the best teachers I have ever met. His lecture notes are interactive and well-organized, I find it quite helpful to understand things by completing the lecture notes during lectures with his guidances. He also gives us lecture notes of MATH1013 and MATH1014, which I'm really grateful for since the MATH1014 lectures I have had didn't cover vectors due to time constrain. I am always astonished to receive his emails every Saturday, in which he summarizes the week's lecture, talks about upcoming topics and reminds us of upcoming deadlines. He uses a lot of examples and similes (and sometimes memes too) when he explains things that are really comprehensible and fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very patient and enthusiastic to solve our queries (you may ask in Cantonese if you prefer to). It is always thrilling to ask him questions since I can often learn a lot of things and have a clearer understanding afterwards. He also replies to emails very quickly. He could have better time management to reduce the need for overrunning lessons and having an extra lesson on a public holiday (understandable though). It has been an awesome learning experience overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Henry :)",

The second half becomes more difficult. I didn't think I had a good understanding of the line integrals and the surface integrals and the physical applications. The final exam is difficult, both calculations and the concepts. Around 10 MCs and 3 long questions for the final. However, I didn't think it is terribly difficult, cuz quite some problems really resembled the exercises on lecture notes. Maybe my not having spent enough time studying is a more important reason for my bad grade in the final. Still, it is awful that don't knowing the integral of arctanx prevented me from getting so many marks from a long question as well as a MC...",

There are too many things have to be stated clearly before computation(like domain of parametrisation, orientation of surfaces/curves), be aware of that.<br /><br />Maybe Calculus III in Khan academy helps because it is taught by the 3B1B guy. Though I love him so much, I don't have time to watch his videos :(",

He not only teaches us knowledge in the notes but also inspires us :D<br />-<br />And Jimmy puts a lot of emphases on drawing and indeed it is the most important part in multivariable calculus.

Do practice your curve sketching skills, the drawings you will be encountered in this course should be easy and standard enough.<br />----------------------<br />The TA Hugo also tried hard to teach us, yet I found his problems in his handout is far from the course, maybe those questions are easy and standard in his point of view(he is a HKUST alumni, also taught by Jimmy, those problems might be the questions he had in those years) And somehow he always talks about irrelevant stuffs in the tutorial class, always says that &quot;your will learn it in &quot;Chapter XX&quot;, which will be covered in next month&quot; or &quot;This is XXX in complex analysis&quot;, kind of wasting time for these irrelevant stuffs.<br />But he is really nice , passionate and kind, always sends us reminder emails before exams, even after the course he sent us an email about how to get prepared for MATH 2033, he's really a nice guy, I just dont like about his question and those irrelevant stuffs.",

Although it is taught by ivan, it may sacrifice a little rigor in some places for the sake of progress or considering the acceptance of students. It lacks a little detailed explanation of the applicable conditions of certain conclusions, but it will be supplemented appropriately A counter example is used to explain the failure situation. If you want to fully understand it, you may have to do a small lesson in private. However, because this course is relatively less rigorous, the exam and homework focus more on calculations, which will not affect The proof has very high requirements (Ivan's original words are: we don't want to grade 80 proofs), but once I calculate it, I can easily make mistakes.",

I often ask him questions in private chats on WeChat, and he often responds quickly and in detail. There is no airs at all. I often send all kinds of WeChat soy emoticons hahahaha (really very very very very cute hahahahaha). Once I skipped class at noon to go to LG7 to eat dan dan noodles. After eating, I found that Ivan was sitting behind me eating alone. Because I was guilty of skipping class, I didn’t dare to say hello to him, but I noticed his hair at a close distance. It looks far less than in zoom just a little bit :)",

But after all, it is ivan's class, the mean is very low, mt is 39.9/100, and final is 30.2/100, so of course this class is not just an absolute turtle. The specific rules for the turtle are:<br /><br />Obtaining a total point of 95% or above, or top 5%, will guarantee an A+.<br /><br />Obtaining a total point of 75% or above will guarantee an A-range.<br /><br />Obtaining a total point of 30% or above will guarantee a passing grade.<br /><br />Looking at the letter grade, in a hall of about 80 people, there are 10 people with F, almost half of them are B and above, and the mean is just about between B and B-. The proportion of A range is about 18/80, and there are 5 people with A+.",

I'm just trying to find a word that can do better than &quot;good&quot;. &quot;Good&quot; is so lame to describe Jimmy's teaching.<br />He delivers everything clearly. You can easily understand what he is talking about. He has a little accent but that shouldn't be a problem. I think he also tries his best to make his lecture more lively. He would tell jokes or say something funny to us from time to time. I can never forget how he taught the existence of limit. He really danced around that night lol. Anyway, boredom is the one thing you can't get from his lecture. Apart from teaching I think he really cares about students a lot. On the last lecture he talked about how we should be more proactive and speak up. It's kind of an old-school speech but still, I feel great because my professor actually cares about us and is willing to talk about something that is not on the syllabus to try to make us better. I think he's the best professor I've met in UST so far.",

They are definitely good practices, give you a more solid understanding, and surely build up some of your confidence (in preparedness, mostly). If you choose to do all these, then the workload is somewhat huge. But this is a 4-credit course, so I think it's fair.",

The major workload for this course, in my opinion, was the preparation for the exams. It requires a large amount of drilling and practicing before you are fast enough to finish the exams on time, which matters a lot if you aim high for the course. So, do expect a rather heavy workload for those who aim at A range for the course.",

Students who have studied M2 in their secondary schools may have some advantages since the content will cover vectors, dot product and cross product in first few lectures. People who are good at space thinking are encouraged to study this course, since it will be a good grade course for you.",

He tried to define every thing very rigorously, e.g. you need to be careful on &quot;derivative&quot; and &quot;differentiation&quot;.

If you really want an A, try to get 90 or above, mainland students are waiting for your challenges.<br /><br />Some of my mainland friends can easy get 85 or above since they did most of the exercises, as a lazy guy, I did not do any exercises and did not study but attended all the lessons finally can get in B range.<br /><br />Be careful about the midterm and the final exam, try to check your paper and see Jimmy's solutions, once I found that he is not good at setting questions and providing solutions. He used the angle of a marker to give out the solutions which is the thing that I hate for. Once, I asked him how do you know you need to use this method, what is the hints from the question. And he always tells you you need luck sometimes. As a paper maker, I always write my solutions as a candidate does but not at the angle of a marker.",
