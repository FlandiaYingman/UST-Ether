            "comment_teaching": "The overall flow in lecture is quite slow and boring, <br />since the explanation in lecture notes is already very clear and the examples are rather simple, the professor have to speak so slowly and keeps repeating/ reviewing. Hence, lots of student skipped the lessons (especially after the quiz)<br /><br />Prof. Wu and both TAs are nice, they would stay and answer all questions.",
            "comment_grading": "You could get a very high score as long as you put everything (steps and examples in the cheat sheet).<br /><br />Highest score in midterm is 99/100, so be careful not to make mistakes and work faster cause the time limit is quite tight.<br />The final result is not released.<br /><br />The grade is very good too.",
            "comment_workload": "• 10% Homework.<br />• 40% Mid-term.<br />• 50% Final.<br /><br />1 homework for each chapter (about 8 in total). I think it's acceptable, and it's not difficult as well. Just follow the examples in the lecture and tutorial notes and you should be able to finish.<br /><br />two random in-class quizzes (around 10 minutes each), i missed one but didn't affect the grade much<br /><br />No project, no present, just midterm and final.",
