        "description": "This course concerns the fundamentals of energy conversion devices based on electrochemistry. We will discuss the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrochemical reactions, the influence of mass transport, the mechanism of electrosorption, and techniques for their evaluation (cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance, etc.). We will then apply the knowledge to electrochemical devices, e.g. batteries, fuel cells and sensors, to better understand the factors limiting their performance. The course aims to equip the students with basic knowledge and skills of electrochemistry for applied research, especially in the field of energy technologies.",
