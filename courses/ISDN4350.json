This course requires students to go out into global society and industry companies beyond (China, Hong Kong, Korea) for seeking and defining a global user-centered design problem by themselves, to develop the engineering design alternative to solve it, and then to build a working critical function prototype. Students will collaborate through online tools as well as 3 face-to-face meetings throughout the semester in the three respective campuses. This course provides various lectures such as marketing, industrial design, patent law, creative thinking, conceptual design methodology, and case studies in problem ideation. Instructor's approval is required.",

            "comment_content": "Do not be attracted by the topic of product or entrepreneurship. This course even without a fine structure. Many important points in product development were not clearly tought. Sometimes, even the instructor doesn't know the point clearly. If you want to know more about entrepreneurship, try to reach TEMG courses instead of this one.",
            "comment_teaching": "Ideally, this is a course with 3 universities join in. In fact, ust students are supposed to do everything. During 3 hr boring lecture time, most students from other two universities will disappear. But ust students are asked to come. If the lecture is hold by beijing or seoul, their bad English and poor internet connection will totally waste 3 hrs of your life.",
            "comment_grading": "No only in my opinion, but several students also think the grading is unfair. And the course is graded based on group performance instead of personal performance. So if ur teammates are free riders, good luck. Btw, the other two universities do not include this course in their course list. so for their students, they do not need to care abt the f-king grade, and u know what I mean. And there is no peer eva in this course.",
            "comment_workload": "Quite heavy. We spent most of time in this lecture because of the project. Before the final presentation, two days no sleep. Finally, though the result is good, the grading is f-king low.",

            "comment_content": "It said to be about product design and entrepreneurship. But the fact is the professor tried to cover all the things in one semester, from product design, start-up to even business planning. The result is a very loose structure or no rigid course structure I can say. The main problem is that the professor will just read from the powerpoint or not even read the contents..... I dont think you can learn anything from such densely packed course for three hours a week through video conference while there is no support from TA or the professor. <br />And for the final presentation, you can play videos for elevator pitch and keep talking for more than 5 minutes.",
            "comment_teaching": "It said to be a joint project of three universitites. But it turns out to be the monodrama of UST student. You will have a group of students from three universities. But during the whole course, you are hardly to find those students other than UST students. Others just disappear from the class. I mean, you can tell from the empty classroom from Seoul during the video lecture. Then you will know how depressed I was.",
            "comment_grading": "Totally unfair grading.<br />UST students graded on everything while other schools only graded on their final presentation. That means only UST students will work hard to do the assignment. Then you know what I mean, solo time for UST students to carry the whole group. What makes it worst is that the grading is group based, that means no matter someone work or not, is a freerider or not, he/she will get the same grade as you. And dont put your hope on peer evaluation, because there is no such thing in this course. HAHA",
            "comment_workload": "Like a 5 credits course. You will spend most of your time throughout the semester for this project. And before the final presentaiton, you won't have any sleep. As you wont have time to finish the product, let alone the final presentation.",
