            "comment_content": "內容圍繞IS Audit既工作範圍、程序、Methodology。上Percy堂要聽足佢講書同抄足notes，因為就咁睇佢既PPT係無辦法自學。但只要上堂有俾心機，會發覺content係好容易。但有一樣野要注意，就係好多時會混亂左IS同IS Audit既知識，其實佢兩樣都會教，但係exam一定係以IS auditor既身份做出發點，所以記得，無時無刻都要當自己係一個auditor黎看待所有material，咁樣先可以事半工倍。",
            "comment_teaching": "Percy人超好，本身就係IS既UG program coordinator，會好關心學生既進度。佢PPT既style係，每逢去到一d重要既concept，佢都會俾幾個example大家試下，即場講答案，確保所有人都明白先會落下一個topic。有任何野唔明都可以趁break問佢，佢一定會盡力答你。",
            "comment_grading": "兩個quiz一個final，出題按CISA Exam程度出，其實係考你心思細唔細密。本人A range，但其他人就唔知。",
            "comment_workload": "可能Summer關係，其實除左quiz exam以外都真係冇乜野要你做，最多有時叫你上堂前睇定少少material(但其實你唔睇佢都會go through一次)，考試前要溫既野都唔算好多，講到底，佢要你understand就可以。",
