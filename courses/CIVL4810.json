Although there were 4 labs, we only need to write one report for lab 1, and 1 report for lab 3 and 4. The reports were done by a group of 4 or 5 people. It did not take much time to complete.<br /><br />The final exam is open-booked and professor allowed us to bring our computer to the exam venue to read notes so that we don't need to print out the notes.<br /><br />No attendance was needed (except lab sessions). And he provided recordings for lectures and tutorials.",
