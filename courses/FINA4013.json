            "comment_content": "The first half of the semester covers quantitative techniques in valuing a firm, like discounted cash flows, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), relative valuation etc. . You will have to apply those techniques to complete an individual project, which is to perform valuation for a firm of your choice and provide stock market trading recommendations.<br />For the second half some applications of valuation in the financial market will be covered, like IPO, venture capital, leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and acquisitions. One case study for each application (4 in total) to support the professor's teaching.",
            "comment_teaching": "Maybe this is the first time he teaches corporate valuation classes (?) he was teaching 3303 in previous semesters. From time to time he might be unclear what he should say in class, but he did show passion in teaching. Rather than asking you to think in his way and memorize hard facts in valuation, he provided a lot of inspirations for you to 'tell your own story' (he always used this phrase lol). In other words, he was guiding you to generate your personal insights in valuation. Therefore, don't expect much concrete knowledge you can learn from him - you will be learning from your own research under his guidelines.<br /><br />However, he provided a lot of instructions and examples for us to construct the required spreadsheets in valuation project and arranged Thomson Reuters + Bloomberg training sections. Maybe these skills are more useful in your career than his teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "At the beginning of the semester the grading scheme was like this:<br />15% Midterm Exam<br />25% Individual Project<br />50% Final Exam<br />10% Class Participation<br /><br />The professor changed the scheme midway through the semester. Midterm exam was cancelled and case studies were introduced. The grading then became:<br />10% Case Studies<br />35% Individual Project<br />50% Final Exam<br />5% Class Participation (Don't know how he counts though)<br /><br />For case studies, you just need to hand in 2 simple write-ups out of 4 case studies and each counts for 5%.<br /><br />Final Exam is a valuation exercise similar to the project with MUCH MORE qualitative questions to the mock exam. For those questions he is always asking for your opinion about certain kind of financial transactions instead of memorization of facts, like asking you whether the firm is a good target for LBO etc. Make sure you don't ignore these content after revising quantitative parts.<br /><br />I believe I did my project quite well but poorly for case studies. I should also have f*cked up in final exam since I almost skipped all applications of valuation, leaving those qualitative questions blank. Still ended up with a B-. The professor claimed that average grade is between B and B+, and it seems to be true. Grading is very generous - this is a finance course after all, will you expect a good grade at the beginning? :)<br /><br />One minor thing: all scores in each grading element were not disclosed. If your grade is not as good as expected you won't know what went wrong.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload comes from project.<br /><br />25% of the score comes from your own work. This includes a complete set of spreadsheets from financial statements to free cash flows, from capital structure to WACC, and from peer firms selection to relative valuation (using their accounting ratios), as well as a 10-pages report of 'the story' of your chosen firm. Although he required us to hand in interim work, like different parts of the excel file, you still have to amend your insights and your work after he covers new topics. Spending a few nights to complete the whole stuff is necessary.<br /><br />10% of the grade comes from evaluating your peer's work. This part is much simpler - generate 3-pages PPT slides about what you like and dislike of his or her work, and discuss with the peer and the professor in his office. Frankly speaking, I don't know how he grades this part - he keeps scrolling through his iPad on one's valuation project while we are speaking and referring to the slides. Maybe you can only get a good score here if you provide extraordinary insights and attract him to listen to you.<br /><br />For case studies, some (the first 2 if I remember correctly) are shorter (up to 10 pages including appendix) and with much fewer write-up questions, while others are so long with exceptionally challenging questions. Do earlier posted case studies if there are no time conflicts, otherwise it could be a torture as you go through a 30-pages thing.",
