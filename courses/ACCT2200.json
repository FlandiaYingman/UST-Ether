            "comment_teaching": "A professor who went from electronic engineering major to accounting. A really nice and easy-going guy. Delivers very relaxing lessons. Loves weight-lifting and goes to the gym for work-out in the early morning every day.<br /><br />He got a couple of kids. He even used in the class the kindergarten tuition problem of his 2 kids to demonstrate the concept of relevant and irrelevant costs lol.<br /><br />I still remember in the first lesson, he gave free textbooks to those who could name the 3 steps in weight-lifting. Next year if you happen to become enrolled in his course, here you go~<br /><br />He probably could have left UST last year or something, but he decided to stay here cuz he couldn't miss the 2000-ft accommodations (with a 360-degree superb panorama of greenery and ocean blue) UST had offered to him, and probably also the gym room in UST. Okay I FF'ed too much.",
            "comment_grading": "‚úèÔ∏è Quiz 1 (Closed book üìò)<br />Process costing is the most difficult chapter for quiz 1, so it's DEFINITELY gonna appear on the exam paper. Just make sure you know how to prepare the statements ALL BY YOURSELF.<br /><br />I fxxked up the first quiz, getting 6 marks below the median. I just didn't fxxking understand process costing. The mean was just fxxking high.<br /><br />‚úèÔ∏è Quiz 2 (Closed book üìò)<br />All the contribution margin thingy. Needs to prepare the full absorption costing statement and the variable costing statement. Includes the allocation of resources with 1 constraint using accounting method (NOT linear programming). The last question was on opportunity cost and it was basically a game of all-or-none - you either got all 8 credits or you lost all. See the attachment for the question he asked.<br /><br />This time I did better, with 1 SD above mean.<br /><br />‚úèÔ∏è Final Exam (Open book üìñ)<br />Difficult as hell. I'd no idea what was going on even with all the printed notes on my table. I couldn't even finish the paper even though it's a full 3-hour exam.<br /><br />As usual, there were 5 MCs and 3 long questions. The MCs (10 marks out of 120) were probably the only questions you could get them with a certain level of certainty. The remaining 3 LQs... Good luck!!!<br /><br />The first question was on budgetary planning. Tricky and complicated as hell. The first few parts on preparing production budgets looked like free marks for us, but in fact they were already tricky in the sense that they changed the assumption of the inventory level. If you just copied the example on the lecture slides you'd flunk the whole question from the very beginning. The direct labor budget was extremely confusing because there were 2 types of workers working for the same product, and I had utterly no idea how to allocate the number of units produced for each of them. (At last to make it simple, I made an assumption that these 2 types of workers were working in series, not in parallel, to produce the products. Dunno if this is acceptable...) The SG&amp;A budget was another trap cuz the linear regression result he gave you was on a yearly basis, so don't forget to divide the fixed cost by 12 (and we also probably needed to state the assumption that the expenses are incurred evenly/linearly throughout the 12 months blah blah blah...) For those who also divided the variable cost by 12, go back to Chapter 2 to check how we dealt with cost drivers. Then it came to the cash budget and the income statement where I needed to go back and forth and recalculate lots of stuff again for the previous month (and the previous month of the previous month for the uncollected sales revenue). Fxxk it. I dunno if I've overlooked any hidden trap or made any minor miscalculation for such a long question.<br /><br />The second question was basically capital budgeting and probably it was the easiest as soon as you spent some time carefully identifying the cash flows. But it was still a little tricky cuz some of the costs were irrelevant. After the exam I heard someone discussing how to calculate the depreciation using the double-declining-balance method. Hold on... You didn't even need to calculate depreciation (for both the new and the old machines) because<br />üî∂ Depreciation is NOT out-of-pocket cash outflow<br />üî∂ The operating income Allen gave us was CASH income which meant that you didn't need to add back depreciation to get the cash inflow.<br />üî∂ No tax. So no depreciation tax shield.<br />So it was basically just something Allen purposefully put down to daunt us, or a hint by Allen that we didn't need to care about the depreciation thingy at all. And also just don't forget how to deal with the net working capital. Seriously without taxes included (and the related opportunity cost of the forgone depreciation tax shield for the old machine) and with the cash income directly given to us, the question was already much simpler, when compared to the one in the finance course.<br /><br />The third question (variance analysis) was the one I fxxked up the most seriously. It was basically about the situation when a few factors changed (raw material suppliers, direct labor hour rate, efficiency, etc), how these affected the production budget. All questions discussed in class was on the total number of units produced, but this one in the exam was on a per-unit basis and no information about the number of units was provided, so I'm not sure if we still have volume variance anymore. For part (a) I didn't even know whether or not the question was actually asking us to do the variance analysis. Part (b) - I ran out of time. Didn't even have the time to read the question and left the whole question blank. I think I'm gonna lose all the 28 marks. It's FUCKING 28 MARKS!!!!!! <br /><br />I had NO TIME to double-check my answers. It was VERY likely that I'd made calculation mistakes for such long questions. I finally understood what he meant by &quot;budgeting our time carefully&quot; on the instruction page.<br /><br />üíØ Dunno what happened to my final. Got A- at the end. Seems you can fuck up 1 out of 3 LQs in the final and crash 1 of the 2 quizzes to secure an A-.<br /><br />Lastly, I must pay my full respect to all those who major accounting.",

But students without self-discipline like me just skipped all the &quot;minimum amount of practice we should do&quot;. A-ha that's why I flunked the final exam so badly.

No attendance requirement (but I dunno how he gives class participation marks).<br /><br />If you're a student without self-discipline like me please don't register his classes.",

Nicholas is also kind and if you need anything from him, just ask. He replies quick.

One-hour quizzes had 14 and 17 questions and time pressure increased as the course progressed, culminating in a 1.5 hour final with 26 questions. My tip is to always make an Excel or notes, then rehearse all the questions possible in the book.

Make sure to do ALL if not MOST of the exercises on the book since these will solidify your understanding.

Time pressure for the final is insane and without Excel, I probably would not have answered all the questions.

Imo, they are not too useful, may somehow be interesting in some sense tho.<br /><br />Managerial ACCT:<br />Very different from financial accounting (acct2010), and you don‚Äôt really need too much accounting knowledge in advance. Tho professor does not recommend student who haven‚Äôt taken ACCT2010 to directly register into ACCT2200, I do think if you have some basic concept from ECON, OM and FINA, it will be pretty easy for you to catch up. Yes! The course is more like a mixture yet an easier version of microeconomics, operations management, and some basic financial knowledge, instead of our ‚Äústereotyped‚Äù way of thinking what an ACCT course should be.<br /><br />Course materials are more or less the same with other semesters, and other profs, so I am not gonna to repeat here.",
            "comment_teaching": "Li Xinlei is a very responsive professor, she answers student questions very frequently. <br /><br />However, her pace of teaching may be quite slow, she will spend around half of each class to review the contents taught in the previous class. May not be too suitable for those who would like self-learning because of her slow paced teaching. Even if you go to class once every two lessons, you will still be fine in terms of catching up the course materials. <br /><br />I personally think going to class is still useful, but you may simply go for the later half. The most useful things is to listen to the professor answering different students ‚Äúcreative questions‚Äù, and that you will find yourself be able to learn more knowledges out of the slides and notes.",
            "comment_grading": "I rank a ‚ÄúB‚Äù here not because Li Xinlei gave bad grades, indeed, in terms of percentage curve, I believe she gave the max A-range already. However, the problem is the design of quizzes.<br /><br />Let me share the scheme first:<br />Quizzes 75% (Best 3 out of 4, each 25%)<br />Individual Case Project 15%<br />Assignments 10% (Based on effort, 10 out of 11)<br /><br />Doing assignments yourself without copying online sources will help with understanding the course contents and hence prepare better for the quizzes. (And btw she will randomly pick some homework and check. Doesn‚Äôt matter you did it correctly or not but definitely not selfie this time, please)<br /><br />For the quizzes, however, she allocated the number of questions and the score for each question quite awkward in the sense that you may be tricked about the score and time distribution. As an example, her first quiz included 13 questions with a 60-minute duration. The first 9 questions were of 1.25 points each, everyone expected each question worths 1.25 points, so we spent around 40 mins finishing up to the 9th question, then when we jumped to the 10th question, it is 10.75 points, the 11th and 12th questions were 7 points each, the last one was worth 14 points. And the max. score is 50. Lol.<br /><br />Also, I think that the later three quizzes were designed way too easy, such that everyone got very high marks, so that the grade division was narrow, losing 2-3 points overall means a difference in sub-grade.<br /> <br />But apart from the ‚Äúweird‚Äù design of quizzes, the gradings are fine. Tho imo the markings of the case project was a little bit too vague and lenient such that the mean was 13.9 out of 15 and failed to differentiate students‚Äô abilities enough.",

You can definitely self study by reading the PowerPoint but I do recommend watching the lecture videos as he may make announcements in class and you might miss it if you skipped the class. For the quizzes, I think the level of difficulty could be higher. I have heard that many people got full credit for the quizzes.

The TA didn't answer my question but ordered me to ask my question on Piazza for the purpose of &quot;fairness&quot;. WTH???! Almost every students in UST asks their questions by email and almost every professors and staffs replies by email. How can this be unfair? TBH, the students are competitors in terms of studying.

I am not clever enough to fully understand what he taught before the discussion starts. The people in the breakout room just Erm erm erm...... Some of the people will just mute their mic and keep silent for 10 min.<br />Allen's teaching is fine. I think his teaching pace is a bit fast, maybe he expected us to finish reading the materials before each lesson? Anyway.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading scheme:<br />75% Quizzes (4 quizzes in total, count only the best 3)<br />15% Individual case<br />Participation:<br />5% Self-practice quizzes<br />5% Class participation<br /><br />The Quizzes are quite easy. You are allowed to open book open notes. There will be some MCs (conceptual questions) and fill in the blanks (calculation questions). The quizzes are not tricky, but you need to make sure you understand the concepts of the formulas. Actually many of the questions are straightforward. You should have sufficient time to finish all the problems in the quizzes. However we were not allowed to go back to the previous questions to amend answers, so it is a must to check your calculations once again, to make sure that you didn't make any silly mistakes before you click next. We were not offered a partial credit for careless mistakes, so you will lose many marks with each wrong question. (I cannot get full score in the last quiz since I forgot to input a negative sign for my answer...) No final exam for this course.<br /><br />The individual case was quite similar to the cases Allen has mentioned in class. The case was released right after the last quiz and you had around 5 days to finish it. What you need to do is to read the case and answer the questions. It was not a challenging task but it will be definitely more difficult than the questions in quizzes. <br /><br />The self-practice quizzes were counted as a component of participation. You can find them on your e-book account. You just need to complete 60% of the quizzes (regardless of the score you get) then you will get 5%. Make sure to finish them before the end of semester.<br /><br />For me,<br />Quiz 1: 30/37 (dropped)<br />Quiz 2: 39/39<br />Quiz 3: 38/38<br />Quiz 4: 36/42<br />The mean is around 77%<br />Individual case: not released<br />Self-practice quizzes: 5%<br />Class participation: I think almost zero haha<br /><br />The grading is fair. I turns out got an A- (even though I got a C in ACCT2010) Try to understand all the materials and go thorugh the exercises once, AND BE CAREFUL during exam, then you will be able to get good grade.",

Additionally, there are two textbook problem sets which are graded on effort (not so much results). There is also a 'project' which is more of an assignment which will be graded based on results.",

There were some case studies as well, but most of them were not tested in the exams.",
            "comment_teaching": "He was very hea, although the official schedule shows that he has 2 lectures per week, 1 of the lectures was optional and for the other, he claimed that it was compulsory, but no attendance was being taken, and he was just simply reading aloud the ppt (with a lot of unrelated jokes). In order to score high in exams, you must BUY his e-book (written by his father), My Educator, for the course material and quiz practises. Some people may find his classes relaxing, but for me, I really hope that he focuses more on the course material rather than spending half an hour talking about his family or unrelated jokes.",
            "comment_grading": "The only best thing about this course is the grade and that's all. <br /><br />For quizzes, you just need to do all the quiz practices in My Educator and you must get high marks because the midterm questions are very similar (more than 75% similar) to the practices questions. I scored 21/21 for the two midterms, the two means were lying around 18/21.<br /><br />For final, more than half of the questions are similar to the practise questions, but in final it was mostly long questions requiring steps. Scored higher than 1 SD in the final.<br /><br />Final grade was A+.",
            "comment_workload": "Not much if you don't quite study. The quiz practices are not quite demanding as the deadlines are just for your references, you can do it anytime for revision without mark deduction.<br /><br />However, I don't think he has explained the concepts clearly in class, so you must make sure you understand the course material on your own, afterall, self-study is very important.",

The mid-term exam with 20 questions lasts for 3 hours, and almost half of the students stayed until the end... IT IS JUST MULTIPLE CHOICES! (Derrald said students should be able to leave within 1.5 hour...and see...)<br />Derrald said that he did not like an exam with a very high mean and everyone gets full mark, so revise harder and do more exercises to get familiar with his question types will help.

Skills for solving more advanced and complicated questions are required. It‚Äôs important to understand what the professor talked in the lectures and some details about the cases given in class, as they will be tested in exams.<br /><br />Overall easy content and not so time-consuming. Read the e-book and do the quizzes helped me a lot.",

The professor said that he takes a picture of the classroom every time for compulsory lectures.<br /><br />The questions are not easy, many students took all 3 hours to complete the paper.<br /><br />However, the mean is pretty high, about 85%. Therefore, the course is easy to study but hard to get a good grade.<br /><br />I got about 95% overall, A+.",
            "comment_workload": "Two 1.5-hour lectures per week, one of them is optional. However, stuffs in the optional lecture will also be tested, so better attend both lectures.<br /><br />The e-book is useful, with detailed explanation and quizzes. It is noted that one or two exam questions were the exact questions in the online quizzes. <br /><br />Overall light workload, but need some extra work in order to differentiate you from others for an A range.",

This is the second course of the principles of accounting sequence. It introduces concepts, accounting methods, and analytical tools related to managerial and cost accounting. Topics include fundamental cost concepts, job-order and process costing systems, CVP analysis, budgets and standards, segment reporting, and decision-making using cost information.",
            "comment_teaching": "I really liked the professor's style of delivering lessons. He is very brief and clear with his message. Gives real-life examples or in-class exercises that help students understand some possibly-difficult questions.<br />He handed out prints once in every week and let students solve them. No attendance check and the professor allows you to come to any time slots.<br /><br />With him, I personally found Managerial Accounting really fun and easy-going actually.",
            "comment_grading": "As long as I remember, there was no mid-term but one or two substitute quizzes. I personally felt them not difficult at all and the time was more than enough to double-check the answers. Other than one or two challenging questions, the difficulty was similar to the weekly quizzes that were assigned on Internet.<br /><br />Easier quizzes or exams may not be helpful if you are aiming for an A+. So just like all the other accounting courses, be careful with your numbers during exams! :)",
            "comment_workload": "I wouldn't say there was a lot of workload (considering it is an accounting course) but it was quite bothersome to watch videos, read e-Book, and finish quizzes on Internet every once or twice in a week. From certain point of time, I quit listening to video lectures but it did not affect me much so I guess it is more of a supplement rather than a must.<br />Each quiz consists of 5 or 10 questions and is marked immediately. Quizzes are usually very simple, covering basic concepts from each chapter.<br />This system pretty much forces you to keep focused throughout the semester, yet it may help you from putting all-nighters days before the exams.<br /><br />Before you enroll to this course, be sure you judge yourself wisely. If you are more of a person who prefers to chill out throughout the semester and suffers few days or weeks right before exams, this course may not be a good fit for you.",

In his lessons, he would not only discuss the important principles of accounting, he would also spend some time explaining the intuition behind, which is really good but the intuition is not covered in exams.

There is a question in the final exam of whether you would like to shift the weight of midterms to the final.

A smart strategy is just to post dumb questions you already know the answers to. Many of my peers did this and they scored full participation.<br />- Do the Practice Case Final, it is your ONLY chance to get feedback on something remotely similar to what you'll get in the final. Also, do some praying :)",

He is knowledgeable in his field and he frequently relates his past experience in the field to the content he is teaching. I would give his teaching prowess an A/A+ rating. <br /><br />Although I am more than willing to sing his praises in terms of his teaching ability, I think the course design ( Absolute grading + subjective essay marks with high ambiguity and little transparency) is really really BAD. I would recommend finding another session with non-absolute grading if possible.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading Scheme:<br /><br />Canvas Quiz Discussion 10% (5/10)<br />&quot;10% of your grade will be based upon the frequency and quality of your Canvas discussions, infrequent or low-quality posts will not receive full credit.&quot;<br /> &quot;Canvas Discussion Participation: 10% of your grade will be based on your regular participation on the Canvas discussion board for each chapter. You should post meaningful questions when you have them and help answer other student‚Äôs questions. Though this grade is subjective, students should consider one high quality post per chapter to be the criteria for full credit.&quot;<br /><br />The ACTUAL GRADE is assigned purely based on frequency. i.e for me I only put comments in&nbsp;&nbsp;5 discussion threads = 5/10, it doesn't matter how many posts u do in each individual one, just need to do all. I screwed this up because I didn't realize frequency is the defining criteria.<br /><br />Quiz 1: 30% (37/40) mean~ 32/33 ish<br />Quiz 2: 30% (30/30) mean ~ 24/25 ish<br />Canvas was closed after the semester ended so the means are only roughly what I rmb<br /><br />Case-based Final: 30% (70/100 ~ O: M, C: M, P: M)<br />3 criteria - low-&gt; medium-&gt; high scale<br />Origninality - Creativity - Practicallity<br />Task: write a no-word limit essay on a case he assigns during the lesson. The essay is based on a company revealed at the start of lesson. You have till the end of the lesson to write it. This essay is REALLY OPEN-ended, as in you have to identify your own challenge for the company they give you then propose a solution for it. No case brief- just internet. The essay does not have to be directly related to course material although it is suggested to make some links where possible.<br /><br />In my opinion, this aspect of the course is extremely unfair, the essay grade is mostly subjective and has minimal relation to the course materials. Yet it carries a 30% weighting?! This normally wouldn't be a problem except that the course is graded absolutely. From a student's perspective, this is really unsatisfying because aside from a practice case done in class theres no real way to prepare for it. It feels like you are coin-flipping your grade, and in its current form, I feel believe the course is poorly designed in terms of rewarding students' grades based on the actual course content. (Case Essay + participation ~40%, of course, has almost nothing to do with the course !!!!!!! and it's absolute!!!!)<br /><br />My Final Grade: B<br />Disclaimer: Although I am rather dissatisfied with my grade many of my friends achieved much higher(A-), mainly through high participation and Case final grades even though they had mean/ below mean quiz scores. However, some others are also in a similar position to me, with high quiz scores but low mediocre case-final grades.",

You can do some general prep like find possible solutions for companies in general, but this is p much the limit of what you can do.<br /><br />Very Very chill, kinda like a 2-cred workload",
