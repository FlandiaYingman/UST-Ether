            "comment_content": "我自問對CM算好有興趣，但個course既內容實在令我好失望。古典力學之於物理就好似莎士比亞既作品之於英國文學；古典力學係物理學既經典。但呢個course不但冇表達到古典力學既優美 (雖然係預計之中)，反而令佢淪為一堆純粹煩雜枯燥既計算，搞到連我呢個愛好者都打從心底生厭。成個course似係讀math多過physics。<br /> <br />其實主要問題係本textbook。本野真係係可以揀到最差既CM text，但prof.遍遍就係要用佢。Folwes寫野好dense又鐘意用一堆complex sentence structure，令到成本野不必要地難明，而且睇起上來非常費力。但另一方面佢寫式果陣又時不時跳一堆step (wtf?)，真係令人唔明佢究竟本野到底係咪想教人野。最難頂係佢勁鐘意用好多internal reference，鬼知條(eq. 6.7.89)係乜柒？我睇本野係想學classical mechanics 而唔係背d equation既號碼。就連睇個solution都可以辛苦到嘔血，真係垃圾到喊出黎。<br /> <br />在此以上，本野既overall organization真係差得可以。每個chapter都cover好多野下，但好多時辛辛苦苦食晒成個chapter結果都係唔明到底個chapter目標係想點。例如話ch.6 central force，一開始係度講gravitation，講左幾個section突然跳左去central force motion, orbit equation (ok 冇問題，呢個係個chap既主旨)，但講幾講又跳鬼返去gravity仲有一堆亂七八糟既野，so wtf you want? 每個chapter 既 scope 都 defined unclearly，又鐘意中間穿插一堆野，principal results 同 applications又分唔清，material present既次序又亂，唯一好既就係本野咁樣呢度塞d果度塞d，塞到300幾頁都完左11個chapter。<br /><br />但問題係雖然本書咁差，但係個Prof.就係鐘意係呢本野，成個course跟住本野教。但係跟又唔係跟得晒，power point有時會skip左d section，只係prof.又一副想你睇晒本，唔講清楚咩野cover咩唔cover，然後hw出題又成日出d lecture冇教到既部份，間接逼你要食晒本垃圾。<br /><br />成個course既主旨都唔知係叫你學physics定叫你背formula，midterm同final 都唔比 formula sheet，搞到每個人都一定要花時間去背formula，除非你有辦法可以係考試咁短時間內derive到晒出黎。",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. 幾有心但係好悶，但應該好過一龍大師。<br /><br />Power Point做得好差、好亂、好難睇，但有時算係好過睇本textbook。只係都係一樣果個問題，prof 唔講清楚咩教咩唔教。Ch.9 後面係成個course最難既部份，但prof上堂唔教，PPT又冇cover，只係叫人返去自己睇，咁即係想點? 時間就得咁多，如果唔係考既邊個要花咁多時間學熟果d咁難既野?<br /><br />仲有就有hw assign得勁hea，每份都係書裡面 3,6,9,12,... 但裡面好多題目都好垃圾，成日有一堆唔知咩trick先做到，仲好鬼死鐘意玩「承上題」果味野，再唔係就根本係lecture冇教過 (wtf?)。佢有次上堂訓話過唔好抄功課，要自己做先會學得識d physics，但問題係你出d題咁多都咁垃圾，做完都根本唔會有幾大幫助。",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm、final都出書裡面d題目，但grade就真係好爛。Midterm同final都呈現一個anti-normal distribution，好多人好低分，亦好多人好高分。Midterm直頭一堆人滿分，但mean得 14/30。同埋記得check卷，以往 (包括今屆) 都有唔少機會改錯卷，我自己final check完卷加左5分 (滿分50)。<br /><br /><br />以下幾個例子比大家參考下：<br /><br />(1) Midterm above 1sd, final below 0.3~0.4 sd, assignment滿分，total grade above mean 6~7%，B-<br /><br />(2) Midterm 炒晒，final 踩mean，assignment滿分， C-<br /><br />傳說講到明係唔F唔D人，但C- range目測極闊。",
            "comment_workload": "極大。差唔多每個星期一份assignment，除左頭兩份，每份至少都差唔多10條。其他3000,4000 PHYS course weekly assignment最多都係assign 3-4條，但呢個真心係咪食懵左，3,4條都夠做到死，10條唔抄solution點做呀?<br /><br />好心佢地assign之前自己試下做一次先啦，d時間唔係攞晒黎讀呢個course架。",

            "comment_content": "The content covers a broad range of topics from the Marion and Thorton textbook. <br /><br />The first week covers some mathematics prerequisite, more specifically looking into the coordinate transformation, and some concepts in linear algebra and multivariable calculus. However, it is important to note that although not a prerequisite, knowledge in multivariable calculus and linear algebra is required before taking this class, as it is quite mathematically rigorous. <br /><br />The following weeks up to the midterm covers material such as solving the damped harmonic oscillator, driven harmonic oscillators, calculus of variations, rotating reference frames, and finally Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. <br /><br />From the on up to the final, the materials covered were orbital dynamics, the inertia tensor,&nbsp;&nbsp;central force problems, more on rotating the frame and finally coupled harmonic oscillators.<br /><br />Personally, I hoped that the professor would have covered, special relativity and more on scattering cross sections.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is quite good, as he will derive most of the equations rigorously. Moreover, he provides many examples and goes over different techniques for solving problems. The only weakness of his teaching style is that at times he would go through a proof or derivation very quickly and it is hard for students to follow and hence some self-studying is required. <br /><br />The professor is very good and he is very enthusiastic and after the exam, I talked to him and he is willing to accept criticism.",
            "comment_grading": "The weighting of the exams are as follows:<br /><br />Homework: 15%<br />Quiz: 10%<br />Midterm:30%<br />Final: 45%<br /><br />In both the midterm and final there are a certain amount of buffer marks. For example, in the midterm, there are a total of 80 marks, but the professor only counts the top 70 marks and in the final, there are a total of 125 marks but only the top 100 marks are counted. <br /><br />The homework tasks are quite time-consuming however, if done properly they are very good practices for the quiz and final exam. <br /><br />The quizzes are open notes and are relatively short, they are not that stressful.<br /><br />My breakdown was:<br />Midterm: 100% (77 marks out of the 80, the mean was 47.3% and the SD was 24.9%)<br />Finals: 100% (119 marks out of the 125, the mean was 46.2% and the SD was 31.0%)<br />Homework: 95.6%<br />Quizzes: 67.5%<br /> <br />The grading is quite fair because partial credits are rewarded quite generously in exams and the mean is typically very low. <br /><br />PERSONAL ADVICE:<br />I spoke to the professor after the course and he said, he will consider the A+'s to those who score above the threshold.",
            "comment_workload": "There is a homework problem every week and it is typically worth 15%. If one attends the lecture it is fairly easy to score high in the homework problems. Passing is very easy, however, getting in the A range is not so difficult either one must score 1 SD above the mean for all task to get an A-, an A+ is a little bit more difficult.",

I encourage you to take his course. He is a local prof. that can speak like a native speaker. More importantly, Adrain's assignment, midterm and final are doable!!! unlike Ivan Ip (இωஇ).<br /><br />Adrain's lectures have a lively atmosphere, he distributed candies to student who answered questions (but I still kept silent throughout the course anyway (///ω///)). And he is an easy-going person so feel free to ask any question to him after class. He uses his own lecture notes. His lecture notes are well-organized with abundant examples, for me, it is no need to read any additional material for this course. Adrain's assignments are also thoughtfully designed, he won't give you tedious calculation most of the time (which is good for a MATH Major student like me ੭ ᐕ)੭)<br /><br />(btw, Perhaps this is a best course to fulfill the stupid IRE requirement for all non-PHYS Major students)<br /><br /><br />*** Our TA, Patrick Cheung Shun LI<br />           Jason Chun Ki TAO<br />           Yanbai ZHANG       ***<br /><br />I didn't pay much attention to their tutorial after the quizzes.

Cutoff for A+ is 95 I guess _(:з」∠)_.<br /><br />I think the grading is lenient cuz the exams are very standard and the marking scheme is extremely lenient. Also bonus can roughly boost your total score by 1 subgrade so you better attempt the tutorial quizzes.<br /><br />EXTRA: In midterm exam:<br />Patrick (TA): Just try your best to do this paper, it is normal that you cannot finish it within 1 hour.

            "comment_workload": "Well...let me tell you sth. about me first. The only point for me to take this course is to fulfill the stupid IRE requirements (aka. take 2 2000-level science course that's not you major). So my attitude towards this course is to learn like the &quot;least action principle&quot;, so I think that the workload is not large. We have 11 weekly assignments and each of them consist of ​around 4 problems. Most of them are application and variation of the examples in the lecture note so I usually finishing 1 assignment within 4 hours (I guess it is the standard workload for 3-credit PHYS course?).<br /><br />Before the exams, besides doing problem sets and examples in lecture notes again, I just simply go through the deviation for each formula and try to derive them with draft paper (like exam). For some difficult topics, I give up basically (sorry Dr.HoHoHo :PPP) and memorize the result like adding an extra term \\Omega x A in non-inertial frame, moment inertial tensor, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. At the moment that I finished typing my review to this course, I still don't know why it works (￣y▽￣). But somehow physicists claim that it works, then IT MUST WORKS. And I am a student studying PURE MATH! After passing this course, I dun need classical mechanics anymore (=^▽^=) (hopefully...)!!! So basically, I was more focusing on the application of the theorem. And y it works? You will be happier if you take it as granted (｀▽´). That how I studied physics with &quot;least action principle&quot;.<br /><br />Good luck :D<br /><br />(I still need to take 1 more 2000-level PHYS course for that stupid requirement （╯‵□′）╯︵┴─┴)",

LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS<br /><br />Chapters 5, 6 and 9 are probably the most important to understand, either because they're so packed with content, they're difficult, or both. Don't be fooled by the course description; although one of the questions on the final will be on Lagrangian mechanics, this chapter will barely be covered in class!<br /><br />The textbook itself is pretty hard to follow. There are hundreds of equations per chapter, most of which will show up in the solutions. The author's also very long-winded.<br /><br />Also, I'd recommend looking through any parts of the textbook that the professor decided to skip during lectures, because apparently he says it would be useful to know the content even if he didn't cover it!",

If you're a second-year student and haven't taken PHYS2124 yet (or are taking it in the same semester as this course), this will be a problem. As a result, his pacing is very hard to follow.<br />Sometimes, however, the professor does provide some useful examples and explanations in class, so you could consider going to lectures. You could also ask him questions after class, but I found that he often didn't understand my questions.<br />Overall, though, I think that it would be more effective to self-study, and look for the TA if you have any questions.",

Also, each question takes a fair bit of time.<br />Extremely wide C- range.

However, it spent a lot of time on Kepler problem but only 1/3 of the total time on analytical mechanics, resulting a sudden stop after deriving the Hamilton equations and missing a lot of important content which would also be quite important in latter study like quantum mechanics.<br />You'd better learn something by yourself, while taking this course or when finding something needed in latter study, depending on your style. Maybe Goldstein's book is a good choice. You may find it in UST library.",

However, be careful, the TAs might do weird things like grading the paper randomly and making a lot of wrong judgement. I got back more than 10 pt in final paper checking, and one of my friend got about 20 pt back. E.g. one of TA said sin^2+cos^2=1 is not obviously and he is not sure whether this is correct so he could not give mark to my friend because his work used this.<br />DO REMEMBER TO CHECK OR ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN.

Ideally, these topics should've constituted an entire 3 Year course, instead they are taught in a rushed manner in the last 2-3 lectures.<br /><br />Tutorial sections are good enough, the problems he chooses are sometimes from the book, but sometimes he discusses some advanced results not part of the course.<br /><br />The book used is Analytical Mechanics by Fowles and Cassiday.",
