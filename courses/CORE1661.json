        "name": "Cantonese Opera in Hong Kong Culture",
        "description": "The “culture” of a community encompasses the social and personal behaviour, language and dialects, visual and performing arts, economic activities and the ideas, beliefs, and customs of its people. As a traditional genre of performing arts unique to Hong Kong, Cantonese opera has a long history of development and is entwined to arguably all such aspects of Hong Kong culture. Set within the socio‐cultural context of Hong Kong, this course explores the genre in terms of its course of development, repertory, plots, script structure, performing techniques such as singing, acting, reciting and fencing, troupe organisation, training of artists, performing venues including theatre and the bamboo stage, and its marketing strategies, aiming at unfolding to the students how an art form is appreciated through both the aesthetical and functional perspectives. The course will be offered either in Cantonese or English subject to different offerings. Students are advised to check the medium of instruction/materials before class enrollment.",
