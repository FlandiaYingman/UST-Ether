            "comment_content": "Everyone feels like Albert Einstein in this course, believing they have disproved some of the fundamental laws of classical mechanics. The only problem is----this is a lab course for classical mechanics, not modern physics. <br />There is simply too much emphasis on the propagation of random errors but not a single f*ck was given to systematic errors. [eg. Students are not asked to keep only the data that made sense so full credit was given to students who got 30-50% percentage error. But if you miss the +/-0.01g error of measuring things using the accursed electronic balance (which only accounts to ~0.001% of the error), your lab report marks will be below mean. Isn't it fascinating?]<br />Anyways, this lab is still a good way to help you develop practical skills, which will definitely help you handle everyday appliances, or perhaps... realizing your not-so-distant dreams of becoming a Nobel-bearing scientist.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Su is nice and is always willing to give advice to those in need, be it at tutorials or practical sessions. However, some of her marking rubrics are quite ridiculous. <br />And don't get me started on the TAs...",
            "comment_grading": "The only thing good about this course is: the grading is EVEN better than PHYS1112 (i.e. SUPER GREAT)!<br />The scores will be normalized for each lab section too so it is okay to be with a TA who gives low lab performance marks (30%, another 70% for lab reports). Preparing for labs is important as finishing labs early is the one true standard for giving out performance marks (given that you don't break any lab equipment or say bad things about your TA).<br />I got above mean 1.5sd--&gt;A+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is absolutely too light for a 1-cred course! Look, every week,you only need to write an Excel file for error propagation in about 1/2 hours, discuss the &quot;reading comprehension&quot; problems with your peers for about 2 hours, finish last week's lab report in the blink of an eye and finally attend another 2 hours of doing wonderful practical work with men of your age. Oh and btw, you should also prepare your labs beforehand and arrive at least 15 minutes before your lab session commences if you want your lab performance marks to stick with the mean. Don't you realize how lucky you are to be able to receive proper education? Tens of thousands of children all across the world are suffering from hunger and yet you can't even afford to skip lunch to show some respect to the grandiose enlightenment of physics? <br />廢青。",

Once in the class photo session, and once in the first tutorial session (sidenote theres 3 tut sessions in the whole course, went to the first one and never went again. useless). I honestly do not know the purpose of HAN, Yilong aside from assigning the final letter grades.<br /><br />The TA and technician for my lab session are very friendly, but unluckily I sometimes can't the Indian accent of my TA.

One lab report every week, usually involving plotting graphs and dealing with error propagation. For most of the values you need to calculate out the error range, which is very very tedious. Also the after-lab questions in the lab reports are quite weird and sometimes unrelated. Like in the final lab about latent heat, the last question was &quot;Speculate on how the latent heat of vapourization might influence climate and weather systems.&quot;<br /><br />btw the lab reports for every year are the same so u guys have to do this also lmao",

To demonstrate, I shall use my score as an example:<br />My overall: ~83.7<br />Mean(according to canvas): 82.6<br />Average SD: 5.4<br />Using this calculation, I would seem to get around B+/A-. However, in reality, my TA gives really low score in general:<br />Mean: ~77, SD: ~7<br />so considering this, I am in fact almost 1SD above my lab session, so at the end, I get an A.
