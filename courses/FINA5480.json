        "description": "This course will focus on three alternative \"asset classes\", namely commodities, trade finance and infrastructures. The purpose of this course is to give participants a good understanding and workable knowledge of the techniques that should be part of the toolkit of anyone investing in, trading, hedging, analyzing and/or advising private and institutional clients on these three alternative asset classes. Furthermore, this course will enable the participants to absorb the analytical arguments in the technical publications – the in-house research notes of financial institutions and in practitioner oriented journals – that deal with commodities and their markets, and to apply them.",
