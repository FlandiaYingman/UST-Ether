        "description": "This is a course about new strategic opportunities arising from environmental risks. Public and regulatory demand for environmental products and services must co-exist with the corporate institutions of maximizing shareholder wealth. This course examines both the theoretical and practical issues that arise in attempting to balance the health of the natural environment with value creation. Is there an inherent conflict between the institutions of business and our ability to care for the environment? What competitive opportunities are created for firms and what do they have to do to seize these opportunities? The lessons from the course will be of interest to both students of strategy and the environment.",

            "comment_content": "This course covers many aspects of sustainability by giving close examples of actions that have taken place or ones that will take place courtesy of business action. <br /><br />Of the two lectures every week, the first one is a teaching styled class where the professor himself gives insights into concepts that cover sustainability and associated actions. This class requires a reading to be done <br /><br />The second lecture discusses a case study(typically about a known MNC and its attempt to be more sustainable). This class also requires the whole case to be read before coming. The professor will observe class engagement and ability to use concepts for a meaningful solution.",
            "comment_teaching": "Paul is a very engaging professor who often utilizes humor for regaining the attention and collaboration of a classroom. He uses poignant statistics of business operation and creative videos to relay his idea. <br /><br />He builds an environment which is pro-learning and facilitates better understanding of concepts while making students question some aspects of business as well.",
            "comment_grading": "The course grade is divided as such: <br /><br />30%- Midterm <br />30%- Case Write Ups(2x15%)<br />30%- Final Exam<br />10%- Class participation <br /><br />Midterm: This exam tests the knowledge of both theoretical and case study concepts that have been picked up and can be asked in any way whatsoever. The exam is curved where the mean was 75/100 with lowest score of 50/100. <br /><br />Case Write Ups: Of the 10-11 case studies that are discussed across the semester, each student must pair up with another student and produce a 1000 word write up on the actions of the business. The format is quite similar to the one that is discussed in classes. The grading is fairly lenient with the mean for both write ups hovering around 12/15. <br /><br />FInal Exam: No marks were released however this exam was based of one whole case study; similar to the case studies discussed across the semester. The objective was to produce another write up. <br /><br />Class Participation: The professor expects healthy discussion in every class regarding the case studies and henceforth any input given regarding the case which shows use of theoretical knowledge from the readings should yield a good class participation grade. Although attendance is not compulsory, it is the basis for getting this portion of the grade.",
            "comment_workload": "The course can become very demanding during the time of case submissions. Moreover, preparing for the midterm and final can take a lot of time as every article used in the case must be explored thoroughly.",
