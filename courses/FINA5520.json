        "description": "Headline financial data are informative but not fully revealing, concealing hidden gems and traps. This course applies a wise-investor perspective to looking behind the scenes of financial statements. Building from the ground up, students learn how to spot abnormalities, develop pro-forma financials, build solid valuation models, and gain the knowledge and skills to pitch sound investment strategies. These foundations are supplemented by several real-world study cases illustrating accounting issues such as revenue recognition, valuation, and failed unicorns.",
