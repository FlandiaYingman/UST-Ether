Weekly listening, reading, and composition assignments draw on a broad range of musical styles and intellectual traditions, from various cultures and historical periods. (2) Advice on the background of Students: Students are required to have the ability to sing or to play one or more musical instruments (e.g. Grade 3 in Royal Schools Music Exam or equivalent). The ability to read music and the knowledge to music notation are preferable, but not required.",

            "comment_content": "This is so far the most inspiring, enjoyable and enriching HUMA course I have taken in UST. As a latecomer of musical composition and instruments, most of the contents are quite new for me. As I didn't have a solid music theory background before, so I took together with another course taught by him (HUMA2104), which is quite useful as some basic music theories will be introduced systematically and it helped me better understand what he taught in the composition class. <br /><br />Course content: <br />- interaction of musical parameters; musical form<br />-melodic writing: motivic work<br />-counterpoints (Contrapuntal thinking), harmonic (vertical) vs. melodic (horizontal) dimensions<br />-Harmonic thinking; non-tonal harmonies<br />-Acoustics, human physiology, time: overtone series; consonance vs. dissonance<br />-Orchestration: overview; writing for string instruments<br />-Instrument demonstrations begin ( some players are invited to demonstrate in class) <br />-Modal and artificial scales (non-major/minor scales)<br />-Rhythmic techniques: momentum; form; polyrhythms and tuplets<br />- Polyrhythmic thinking<br /><br />Midterm project: <br />composition of a duet or solo work, with a duration of at least one minute. Depending on the nature of your project, this can also be the first draft of your final composition project (this will be decided on a case-by-case basis).<br /><br />Final project: <br />a work for two or more players, duration at least two minutes, which will be performed in the final concert.<br /><br />Concert report:<br />Attend a live concert featuring classical music (contemporary/20th-century music is particularly recommended), and write a three-to-five-page, double-spaced concert report.<br /><br />Semester-end quiz: more about conceptional things discussed in class, eg. understanding of different musical terminologies, analytical listening, etc.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Kaila is the best professor I have met in UST. He was enthusiastic, open-minded and encouraging for his teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will definitely acquire new insights and inspirations after each class. In the lecture, he will focus on the concepts and theories on composition with music examples and discussion, he always encourages responses and sharings from students. In tutorials, composition assignments from students will be discussed and analyzed together. (It's like a feedback session for our music, we will sit around the professor and he will look at each of our work, add constructive comments and initiate discussion among us) Weekly lectures &amp; tutorials are highly interactive, you are expected to attend all of them! : ) <br /><br />I really like the class atmosphere. Classmates are friendly and eager to share their own perspectives. Just don't be afraid of raising questions at any time, he will answer the questions seriously and elaborated clearly with examples or demonstrations in piano.<br /><br />The TA Galison is really kind and helpful!&nbsp;&nbsp;If you encounter questions while working on your composition project. You can always reach him for seeking advice and discussion. He always gives us free tickets of concerts with high quality: )",

The experience is more precious:) The results will be better than expected. it's more about how much you engage. Be more active in class and after class. persistence of listening music of different genres and motivation",

I did encounter difficulty catching up with everyone in the class. I highly recommend taking a music theory course together with it if you want to learn the basics and doing some self-study/preparations before each lecture.

            "comment_content": "To make an analogy, music is like a universal language, so learning how to compose music is similar to learning how to write an essay. When we learn writing, we first have to read a lot of passages and analyze them, then apply the techniques to our writings. Likewise, when attending the course, we delved deeply into pieces from various composers with drastically different styles, from Bach to Bartok. And Prof. Kaila led us to understand what compositional devices were used in each of the pieces. After lessons, an assignment will be given to let us do hands-on work regarding to the content. Of course, there is a final project to wrap everything up. As for the tutorial section, either the professor or the TA (Galison) would review our homework and final projects and give advice/comments.<br /><br />Some reviews claim that this course is not theory-based, but I disagree. We also learn a lot of music theory; just not the conventional tonal music one. Instead, we learn how composer develops their ideas through different methods, such as sequencing and augmentation, and this methodology applies to all styles of music. Other than the &quot;first principles&quot;, he also introduced us to the music systems used by 20th-century composers, namely non-diatonic scales such as modal scales and octatonic scales. He gave examples of how the masters used the scales in a genius way. I think that part is eye-opening even for people with quite a bit of music experience.<br /><br />Lastly, he also brings us some instrument players, and they helped us know a lot about the capability of their instruments, which enabled us to polish our final project work.",
            "comment_teaching": "The course consists of three parts, namely lectures, tutorials, and individual consulting sections. And I enjoyed nearly every aspect of the course.<br /><br />For the lectures, Prof Kaila is a phenomenal presenter. He mainly discussed with us the observations of pieces from different composers, and he asked a lot of insightful questions to make us have plenty of &quot;aha moments&quot;. Aside from this, he excelled at improvising music. When he introduced a music concept, he often sat in front of the piano and improvise. The one I remember the most was that he mimicked the style of late Scriabin. That inspired me a lot.<br /><br />As for the tutorials, either Prof. Kaila or Galison was in charge of them. They both review our assignments and our final projects, giving advice and recommendations for our work. They have different opinions though; the professor was more open-minded and focus on creativity and ideas, while the TA was more conventional and focused on compositional practice. Sometimes they even give contrasting recommendations. After all, composing music is unlike doing math problems where there is not a definite answer, it is normal for people to have different, or even contradicting opinions.<br /><br />Finally is about the individual consulting sections, in which we presented our project draft to the professor. He made elaborated yet open-ended suggestions regarding our pieces, and we all learn a lot from him.",
            "comment_grading": "Being a one-month summer course, the grading scheme is different from the previous ones. Here is the new scheme:<br /><br />Attendance and participation: 15%<br />Portfolio of exercises/homework: 15%<br />End-of-semester quiz: 20%<br />Midterm project: 20%<br />Final project: 30%<br />No term paper<br /><br />As for the grading, I think it is very good. There are 14 people attending the course in the end, and including me, there are 5 people. All of us get A-grades. It is possible that all of us can get A-grade. I recommend people who want to learn more about music to study this course, provided that they have some sort of music knowledge and experience. The course literally guarantees you a good grade, if I have to exaggerate a bit.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload-wise though, the course was very DEMANDING for most people though. Given that it was a summer course, everything was condensed, and assignments were given twice a week. Aside from that, the final project was given on the first day of the course, but most people simply did not have the required skill to develop their music. So the time was deceptively constrained given the circumstances. Some people even started the final project ONE WEEK prior to the presentation concert. Not only that, after the consulting sections, we have to change our work, often in a drastic way. In the end, some people finished the work on the morning of the presentation day, while others simply withdrew from the course. Fortunately, the so-called midterm project is just the presentation of the draft of the final project, so it more or less lessened our burdens, helping us prepare better. Lastly, the professor did not set a time requirement for our final pieces, since he claimed: &quot;it would hinder our creating progress&quot;. Regardless, most people write pieces that are reasonably elaborated.<br /><br />Difficulty-wise, I think it depends on how dedicated/ knowledgeable is a person to music. There is not a definite answer. On the first day, twenty-something students attended the lecture, and the professor talked something about the criteria for composing music. Then we analyze some music. On the second day, only half of us appeared in the classroom. I think this illustrates the fact that we are supposed to have some knowledge of music in order to catch up.",

He is also a composer, so he completely understands your thoughts (even if you don't articulate well) and can give you the guidance to the right path. Furthermore, he give super detailed feedback for all your assignments and projects. I think I have advanced my music composition skills by tenfold. <br /><br />He is very strict in terms of punctuality, and will not tolerate any late submission or late attendance. 2 late attendance = 1 absent. <br /><br />In class we covered material from different composers, such as Bach, Beethoven, Bartok and more... it seems like he also love these composers (On the contrary, I prefer Vivaldi and Haydn...)<br /><br />TA Galison is also an accomplished composer. He still has the radiance of a teenager despite being older than that and he is very humorous in class and tutorials. He is also an excellent pianist, and he can sightread my midterm composition (which is a 3-part fugue) with 1 day of preparation!!!<br /><br />Galison and Ilari alternate the tutorials, and I find out that Galison pays more attention to detail while Ilari focuses on the whole.

Prof Kaila chose many examples from the classical music repertoire (from Bach to Bartok) to illustrate these topics. He encourages us to analytically listen to music and identify the techniques used. More importantly, he encourages us to keep an open mind when listening to other's work, and allowing us to form different opinions about a piece.<br /><br />The final concert is a cumulation of all the things we have learnt throughout this (admittedly short) semester.

Either Prof Kaila or TA Galison will go through our work and provide suggestions for us to improve. <br /><br />For the midterm presentation and final project, both Prof Kaila and TA Galison provided valuable feedback. Prof Kaila mainly focused on the creative side of things, providing suggestions to phrasing and ideas in our work. TA Galison helped much with the more practical side of things, such as writing idiomatically for instruments and fixing structural issues. Although they might provide contradictory feedback, bear in mind that music is subjective and each listener may have different opinions.<br /><br />It must be mentioned that since this is a small class, the atmosphere is very interactive in general. The sense of &quot;coziness&quot; between students provided us with a platform for open exchange of ideas, and is a welcome break from the (generally rather cut-throat) course experience.<br /><br />All in all, the teaching is inspired, humorous, and a great deal of fun for passionate people.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is excellent. Most of the class got A range. The grade is very fair when taking into account the amount of effort everyone put in (which is a lot during this short summer session).<br /><br />The original grading scheme is as follows:<br />Attendance and participation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15% <br />Portfolio of exercises/homework&nbsp;&nbsp;15% <br />Term paper&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15% <br />End-of-semester quiz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10% <br />Midterm project&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% <br />Final project&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25% <br /> <br />However, since we do not have much time, the percentage of the term paper was shifted too the quiz and the final project. The midterm project is changed to a presentation about work done so far.<br /><br />The final grading scheme is as follows:<br /><br />Attendance and participation: 15%<br />Portfolio of exercises/homework: 15%<br />End-of-semester quiz: 20%<br />Midterm project: 20%<br />Final project: 30%",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is very heavy for a four-week summer course. In total, there were 7 assignments, 1 midterm presentation, and a final concert.<br /><br />The assignments are designed to provide a spark of creativity for your final compositions. Although they don't take very long to do, the quantity makes this course very labour intensive.<br /><br />The final project was even more labour intensive than the assignments. Although we had around three weeks to do the project, we needed to constantly change our project in response to the feedback from the professor and the TA. Although it helped with polishing the final project immensely, the work needed is not insignificant. <br /><br />In conclusion, only take this course if you are prepared to spend much of your effort in writing music. But again, if you don't enjoy what you're doing, it's going to be painful either way.",

            "comment_content": "HUMA2103 is an eye-opening course, providing a creative outlet amidst much stress and tension. Compared to the Music Theory courses (2104, 3104), HUMA2103 focuses on less theory and more creativity. As an online class, it might not be the best option (due to less discussion, if you're into that kind of thing), but it's fun nonetheless. And you get to show off (again, if you're into that kind of thing).<br /><br />As an aside, the course description states that &quot;Students are required to play instruments&quot;, but Prof. Page waived this requirement. Although if you CAN play an instrument, you'll get the opportunity to perform your midterm/final compositions (and maybe your exercises as well).<br /><br />Regarding actual content, in lectures, Prof. Page would introduce various compositional techniques and styles by playing pieces ranging from traditional world music to 20th-century contemporary Western music, analysing/discussing those pieces, then composing together in class.<br /><br />The topics covered include form, counterpoint (2nd species and suspension), voice leading, pitch class sets, text setting, among other techniques and styles to explore different aspects/ways of composition.<br /><br />As the final composition approaches, musicians will be invited to demonstrate their instrument and technique in class, to give you an idea of what you can work with and what sounds can be produced.<br /><br />In tutorials, Prof. Page (again) would go through each composition and play it on the piano (or sing or whatever). In a Zoom setting, discussion is minimal. Only the professor and the student in focus would talk (the rest of us would just remain silent). Once they finish discussing said student's work, he moves on to the next student.<br /><br />The only actual, real discussion I experienced was in the LAST lecture, where they used Zoom breakout rooms for the FIRST TIME. (So much for being discussion-based, harumph. That particular class was pretty fun though.)<br /><br />The final composition is supposedly the culmination of the entire course. The professor and TA would invite HUMA2103 students and professional musicians to perform in a live concert (F2F).<br /><br />Personally, the highlight of this course was the final composition. You get the opportunity to work with actual, professional musicians and it's really eye-opening to see how intricate the whole process of composing is.<br /><br />You get introduced to some constraints in the lectures (e.g. counterpoint) but having your music played by a specific instrument just dumps a whole boatload of constraints.<br /><br />After the first rehearsal, I spent an hour fixing my piece with the pianist (TA Galison) and cellist who were to perform my piece. There were many inherent problems: logical bugs (e.g. &quot;Where is the climax?&quot;), notation issues (e.g. staccato dot on tremolo), performance issues (e.g. pianist's hand had difficulty reaching the chord I wanted), among many more. Their final performance in the live concert wasn't perfect, just saying; but being unfamiliar with performing music, I got a glimpse of what considerations performers need to make, and what they value. I got to stand in their shoes for a moment.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching was ok in general. Maybe a bit boring. But attendance is marked. The course is &quot;discussion-based&quot;, so the professor may call on you to answer a question or give ideas.<br /><br />Prof. Page might not be the most adept at Zoom. He may occasionally forget to switch/adjust the camera (he has a complicated setup). If so, it's up to you to remind him to fix the view. Otherwise you'd suffer from situations where he writes something then asks a follow-up question, but nobody can answer because they can't see what he wrote.<br /><br />Prof. Page: Now can anyone suggest the next note after the C?<br />Class: ... (What C is he talking about???)<br /><br />I think the TA (Galison) is quite good. He doesn't show up on Zoom (or at least he doesn't participate like the rest of us), but he's still quite helpful. He's fairly approachable, easy to talk with.",
            "comment_grading": "I can only say for myself, but the grading seems fair. You'll be graded mainly on your compositions, which are weekly exercises plus your midterm and final. Attendance and participation will also be counted towards the grade. To top it all off, you'll be asked to submit a concert report of a recording on Spotify. If the class was not held online, I believe you'll need to attend a live lecture.<br /><br />The professor and TA take a long time to grade the exercises, but when they finish, Prof. Page would leave some helpful comments and suggestions (e.g. &quot;This chord doesn't work too well with this other...&quot;, &quot;You could try exploring this bit in your future compositions...&quot;).",
            "comment_workload": "Workload can be a burden. For most submissions, you'll need to write out the music by hand, which can take a while. For your final composition, you can write the music using notation software (MuseScore ✨). You'll have to self-learn it though.<br /><br />On most weeks, you'll be expected to submit a scanned, handwritten composition (usually not more than 30 seconds or 8 bars). These can be finished in ~1-2 hours. There will be specific instructions and expectations for each composition. These compositions might just be little melodies or chord progressions, but they provide an exercise for you to work towards the midterm/final compositions.<br /><br />For midterm, you'll be expected to submit a more complete melody, lasting about 1 minute. For the final composition, you'll be expected to submit (and if you could, perform live) a 3-6 minute composition for two instruments.<br /><br />As for the final report... it may spillover into your exam timetable (beware of that). You'll be expected to do some research, and probably spend much time listening to the piece. They'll provide an outline, though, so just follow that and you should be fine.<br /><br />Coming up with the music itself might be tricky. If you have an instrument, you could try striking up a tune, then fitting it towards what you've learned in class. If you've composed before, you could also pick up previous ideas. You could even reuse ideas within the course!<br /><br />Don't worry too much about getting your compositions &quot;correct&quot;. The homework might contain constraints from time to time, sure; but even after satisfying them, you can still channel a lot of creativity into your compositions. Focus on the process (how you arrived at the result), and make choices with a reason.<br /><br />I shall end my rant here.",

You will learn different types of scales, technique to write polyphonic music, and the very important counterpoint.<br /><br />This course is well structured. The progress of the course and the content of each lesson is clearly stated on a handout which will be given at the start of the semester.",

At most 20% of students in the course can get A range.<br /><br />I got about 85% overall and got an A-.",
            "comment_workload": "Quite high. About one assignment per one or two lectures. One concert report and one final project per semester. Midterm project depends on the amount of lectures in the semester.<br /><br />In my opinion, the difficulty of this course is moderate for those who has music background. As this is just an introductory course, you won't be learning in-deph knowledge of music composition. However, if you want to get good grade in this course, you should definitely put effort in your assignment and final composition project.",
