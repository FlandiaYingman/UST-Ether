        "description": "A project-based course that introduces the core concepts in Systems Design Engineering. A system is a purposeful set of interrelated components that form an integrated whole and work together to achieve some objective. The course aims to better prepare future design engineers, as they will be challenged with different multidisciplinary systems in the future. Topics covered in this course include multidisciplinary system design, the design process (problem definition, life-cycle design, design specification, concept/design generation and evaluation, design for manufacturing and assembly), system modeling and analysis, mechanical design and prototyping, ergonomics & human factors through industrial design, user experience & usability testing, design documentation and communications. Instructor's approval is required.",
