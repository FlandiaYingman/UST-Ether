            "comment_content": "Mostly (except the variation calculus) available as Ch. 1 to 6 from &quot;An Introduction to Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations&quot; by David Logan, while the variation calculus (after Ch. 5) was taught using Euler-Lagrange equations and energy methods with pretty specific examples.<br /><br />Maybe the course content is more theoretical (e.g. the derivations of Burgers' equations using weakly nonlinear approximations takes 1 lesson to talk about) than the title suggests, the class is pretty small and even only 10 people took this course this semester.<br /><br />Also no coding in this course. Once I tried plotting the characteristics using Octave and got big X on the figures because Prof. Xiang expected hand drawing. Boo.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Xiang simply went thru the textbook content, sometimes with a bit more details on e.g. how the derivation is done. Usually he showed the slides, speak a few sentences and gave us time to jot/cap the content, then next slide and repeat the process, and lessons were done. In case you can understand the book content by yourself, skip most lessons. Go to the seminars or workshops instead to fulfill the graduation requirement.",
            "comment_grading": "Assignments 30%<br />Attendance (?) 10%<br />Final 60%<br /><br />Not very sure about the attendance stuff because I didn't see it on Canvas or remember Prof. Xiang mentioned it. Other than that the grading seems to be quite good (esp. having had a degree in the same uni). Both assignments and final around mean and I got an A. Big thanks.<br /><br />Pay more attention to Ch. 2 to 5 plus the (derivation of the) Euler-Lagrange equations would be good for your grade.",
            "comment_workload": "Each assignment took me a week to finish even tho I got a quite helpful classmate. Also since final is open book, I'm not sure what he would test so it takes me quite some time to include everything and know that he only asked up to Ch. 5.",
