Reach some body who has source of this course if he keeps on being like this.<br /><br />Moreover, the lab sessions are quiet straight.<br />There is more than 50 students doing the lab in each sessions, but we just got 2 TAs.<br />And for most of the time we will finish the lab materials in about the same time. So while one TA is going to solve some problems raised by other students, another TA has to check the work of more than 50 students.<br />Imagine how long you have to raise your hand to ask the TA to come to check your work.",
