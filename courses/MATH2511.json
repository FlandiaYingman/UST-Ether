            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is very well. Don't worry too much about his language; it's understandable and his English is somewhat fluent.<br />His lecture notes are so tidy and detailed that people can understand what is actually written there. Despite so, I still recommend you to go to his lectures, since he explains materials quite clearly, so that you can understand materials better. One bad thing is that he always delays the lecture ending time, but usually that's the most crucial part of the whole lecture. :/<br />Another reason why you should go to his lectures is because he may set up a &quot;difficult&quot; midterm and final exams, in case few people attend his lecture (which actually happens for this term).",

Conversion: 8 bonus marks = 1 Midterm score ; 13 bonus marks = 1 Final score (if your midterm has achieved 100%)<br />*Note 3: There are 4 computational problems for Midterm, 8 computational problems + 1 MCQ (theoritical problem) + 1 Proof problem for Final<br />*Note 4: Since only ~30 people attended the lectures, some of the final exam questions are exclusively designed for those who actually attended the lectures. For example, the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 in Page 66 &amp; 67 of Chapter 4 is asked directly.<br />*Note 5: For this term, it is actually quite hard to get A range (i.e. 80% or above), due to its &quot;tedious&quot; grading in exams. I saw people were so frustrated about the grading; I saw people get 0 marks in several questions, in which I think they deserve to get some points, but only because LCM thinks that it is a WRONG CONCEPT (curse u!!!)<br />*For my total score, I got full marks for all 4 assignments (with 215 bonus marks), 55 for my midterm, and 61 for my final. Hence, my final score is equal to: 15%*(100) + 20%*(55 + 215/8) + 65%*(61) = 71.05 (215/8 is rounded up to 27, and even though you get 209 for your bonus marks, it will still be rounded up to 27). That gives me a B+ (super sad, knowing that people getting 80% in total get an A)",
            "comment_workload": "Fair.<br />You need to study harder for midterms and finals, since it seems that the midterms and finals will be harder from time to time.<br />If you have actually taken FINA2203 before taking this course, that is an advantage for you. For the homework, since I myself have taken FINA2203 before, so the problems in the assignments are not too tiring, unlike MATH4511.<br />However, for those who haven't taken that course, you may need to spend some time reviewing on your lecture notes, since the homework and the exams are similar to those.",

            "title": "great FUNDAMENTAL financial math course with great lecturer",
            "comment_content": "( you may see the attachment for basic information.)<br /><br />Generally speaking, It is a greater course to introduce the FUNDAMENTAL math used in finance and insurance. Perhaps since I am a MATH major, I prefer to formulae and equations rather than words to understand the concept, and therefore, this course is much better than FINA2203/2303 for me, or somebody like me.<br />The reason why this course is great is its broadness and simplicity. It brings you into the different topics from shallow to deep : From the basic various concepts of &quot;interest&quot; for dealing with different type of series of cashflow (annuities) to their applications in loans, bonds and analysis of cashflows (NPV, IRR, dollar/time-weighted rate of return), and finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;the course will introduce the concept of term structure of interest rate, forward rate, duration and convexity, which are the basic concepts in other financial topics like portfolio management, financial derivatives and risk hedging. <br />I think it is useful for MATH(SF-track) since you will take MATH4512 later (or now), which the materials in FINA2203 cannot sufficiently support you to understand Prof. K___'s &quot;good&quot; teaching as well as you can learn the similar thing in FINA2203 but in a more math way.<br />By the way, Please be noticed that it is also the pre-requisite of other important ACTM electives, like MATH 4427 (In the coming year, this will be divided into 2 courses) and MATH 4514. If you cannot handle with this course well, please re-decide whether you are suitable to the actuarial science since it is already a FUNDAMENTAL course.<br />By the way again, this course is designed for the SOA exam FM but some areas are not yet covered: Immunization, Interest Rate Swap, Determinants of Interest Rates. Except for the part of Immunisation, there are study notes on the website of SOA, so you may have to self-learn them if you want to take SOA exam.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr Leung is a newcomer of MATH department yet with quite a lot teaching experience in other HK colleges. I adore him greatly in his teaching since he taught much better than other instructors that he explained the concept detailly with backup of many useful examples, which was, however, also his shortcoming that he used most of the time in the examples, then he did not have enough time to the materials in last few weeks.<br />Also, he is very nice to the students. he is welcome to chat with the students on different topics (simply in Cantonese, &quot;吹水&quot;), and kindheartedly to who seek him for help on the homework or the course.<br />Also, he focuses on teaching the ACTM courses, which means that if you take ACTM minor, you will possibly see him 3 times for MATH 2511 (core course), MATH 4427 and MATH 4514 (the most recommendable electives in ACTM). <br />By the way, I was surprised that he looks like a tutor rather than a lecturer in the first sight in the first class.",
            "comment_grading": "5~6 Assignments -- 10% <br />Midterm -- 20%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closed book with formula sheet provided<br />Final -- 70% <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accumulative and closed book with formula sheet provided<br /><br />It is moderately a good grading course that getting about 80% overall you will have an A- as well as there is 30% of the A range.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is rather low that the assignments may possibly take you about a few hours, perhaps longer time for the bonus part. Interestingly, each assignment will have some bonus questions, which are optional, and students can get &quot;bonus score&quot; by completing some bonus questions for adding marks to the assignments, midterm and final.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==&gt; All people will do all of them for the bonus score, and I have heard that someone did get 10 bonus points (max. in my semester) resulting in one higher subgrade.<br /><br />Although the compulsory part of the assignment is the easy step-by-step calculation helping you familiar with the formulae and equations, the bonus part is quite tricky and consists of the proof-type problems. Also, you must be clear of the concepts and cautious of the calculation since the midterm and the final are somehow difficult.",

It is also suited to students who wish to understand the mathematics underlying loans, bonds, and some simpler stocks. The knowledge is entirely cumulative, with knowledge previously learned in the course essential to understanding the later parts. The knowledge itself is simple, the proofs are straightforward with only elementary mathematics necessary, and the applications are plentiful.",
            "comment_teaching": "Dr. Huang is without a doubt an extremely hard-working instructor. He teaches very clearly and explains all the proofs and origins of equations. Sometimes this is excessive but it is worth listening during the lecture because he always delivers financial intuition associated with equations. <br />Dr. Huang also uploads every single video of his lectures as well as the class script that is projected to the screen of diagrams. He responds to feedback regarding his teaching very well because he strives to ensure all students learn well.",
            "comment_grading": "Dr. Huang explicitly states that he will ensure that students get the highest possible grade from the ARRO, so grading is not an issue. On the other hand, 65% of the grade comes from the final exam; the rest comes from the midterm. Therefore every question answered is quite important in terms of the total grade.",

Generally, the questions come from the course textbook. <br />The answers are given quickly with worked solutions by the TA. The assignments are always related to the concepts learned very recently during the lectures. <br />In other words, the workload is quite low.",

The concept is similar to those finance courses, but teaches in a more mathematical way. It will be an advantage if you have studied FINA2203/2303.<br /><br />However, I personally do not think the content is useful. and rewarding. The course requires a lot of tedious computational work and it is easy to make some errors. The process is completely unnecessary. For instance, you can use financial calculator to find IRR instead of using Newton's Method to solve for the equation; or plug in formulas in Excel to find out the outstanding balance during the loan repayment period.",

Also, there are bonus scores from assignments to top-up your midterm/final exam score. 8 bonus score equals to 1 midterm score. I personally got 81% in this course. According to the grading scheme, I would get B+, but the professor tries to give the best possible grade to students, so I eventually got A. <br /><br />The exam is tedious though. Many computational work is needed, and it includes proof/multiple choice questions. Besides, LCM emphasises on how you present your answer. Sometimes you cannot earn full credit even you think you have explained everything well. So it is better to follow every step in the lecture notes.",

However, if you get almost full marks on the assignment, the bonus marks can help you increase your final grade by a sub grade. The midterm and final exams are basically like a math exam.

However, the professor's marking style in midterms and final exams are quite harsh. Even you have listed out all the steps which you thought are clear, if he could not understand what you wrote, he would deducted you at least half of your marks. Also, the homework was graded by TA, so you will never know whether your answers can get adequate scores in exams. Even you get all answers correct with correct steps you thought were &quot;clear&quot;, you could still get 3 out of 10 marks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, he said he used absolute grading, however, his exams are usually tedious and difficult with low mean. So, I don't think his courses' grading are great and do not understand why people say his courses have &quot;good grades&quot;. I personally get a &quot;C&quot; from his course. Even your total final score after adding bonus is above 70 (mean is around 54 in total) , you only get B+. Extremely difficult to get A range. <br />Therefore, if you want to get A range in his course, you should write solutions fulfilling &quot;his marking schemes&quot; which he thinks is &quot;clear&quot;.",
