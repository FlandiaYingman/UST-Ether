        "description": "Climate change has been called a ʺtrillion dollar risk and opportunityʺ (Alison Martin, Zurich Insurance) - the biggest risks but also the biggest opportunities lie in Asia Pacific. Climate Change is THE defining societal challenge of our times. As leaders in business and society, students of the GNAM Programme can either be part of the problem, or part of the solution. The course Climate Solutions – A Multidisciplinary Prespective is a starting point for the latter. Participants will be exposed to a range of interdisciplinary insights about the magnitude of the climate challenge, and reflect upon determinants for implementing effective climate solutions. It is a highly interactive course, engaging students in an interactive way to enable deep reflections.",
