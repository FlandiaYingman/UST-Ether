        "description": "This course covers how corporations may become socially responsible. Although the course will cover all aspects of ESG aspects of responsibility, it will focus more on the social and governance sides. We will also be covering how ESG may impact corporate finance decisions, such as project evaluation and firm valuation. The course will follow the CFA Instituteâ€™s Certificate in ESG Investing curriculum. At the end of the course, students should have a strong background to be able to study for this new certification that may give them a cutting edge when applying for jobs related to ESG. Overall, the course will cover both leading theoretical and practical cases related to ESG and responsible finance.",
