Remember this is a LAW course and we are ACCOUNTING students. How can you expect we understand all those concepts just by self-study? If we can self-study all stuff, why UST need to hire an instructor for the course instead of just asking students to read all the contents?<br /><br />After around week 3 or 4, only around 15 people attend his lectures only as the lectures really can't help you much. <br /><br />Prof never listens to students' views and use a defensive attitude towards these concerns, like he is always the correct one. Always has different excuses to push responsibility to others.<br /><br />More importantly, he sometimes forgets the ending time of the class and ends the meeting 20 minutes earlier. He will also suddenly say oh I think it is xx: xx and I will stop the lecture now, which I think this is so awkward.

I thought I would never face a lecturer worse than Terry, until I met him... If it is not my final spring semester, I would definitely drop this course and wait until there is a new professor replacing him...<br />Speechless about his messy notes and irresponsible performance.. Frequently end class earlier and miss to send important announcement to students (such as changing of exam methods)<br />So many assignments and a difficult group project, but no guideline or feedback at all, you have to learn and cooperate with your group mates. Do not expect he will help. <br />You will be more confused by listening to his lectures, suggest to find online teaching videos of HKU or borrow comp law notes from other U such as CU or City..",

The most important thing is to use David's IRAC framework, or else marks will be deducted.<br /><br />Final is 50MCQs. It covers everything but mainly on topics after midterm.
