        "description": "This course builds on the groundwork laid in LANG 1120, LANG 1121 and LANG 1122, and takes students to an intermediate level of understanding of spoken Chinese and a stronger communicative competence in using Chinese in social, professional and business situations.  The course is restricted to students with non-Chinese language backgrounds. Instructors’ approval is required for students with Chinese backgrounds who are from international schools of Hong Kong, China Mainland and other Asian countries, also for overseas students with either Mandarin or Cantonese language backgrounds. For students without prerequisite but with prior Chinese learning experience of approximately 150 hours may seek instructors’ approval to enroll in the course.",

The essays can be useful for oral presentations and written tests, and I recommend people taking it in the future to put work into those assignments as the teacher will mark them and give you feedback to improve them for your presentations.<br /><br />The first essay was about renting an apartment in Hong Kong.<br />The second essay was about writing your personal statement to apply for jobs.",
