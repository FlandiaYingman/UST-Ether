        "name": "The Political and Economic Development of Modern Japan",
        "description": "The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's indigenous resources of economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). Against this historical background, it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration, foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan's political development. Japan's indigenous development of market economy, state-building, and local representative assemblies contribute significantly to Japan's rapid rise as a regional power in 1905 and a world power after 1918. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan, provide them with the analytic skill and critical thinking over the issue of Japan's political and economic modernization. By highlighting the parallel processes of military development and the development of democracy in Japan between 1895 and 1931, this course will help the students to have a better understanding of the rise and collapse of democracy in pre-Japan. This course will help the students to view the relationship between Japan and China from a historical perspective.",

It is impossible to find the exam difficult as long as you watch all his lecture videos. Also contains some open-ended questions then you might need some extra examples to support it. <br /><br />Don't remember my scores but from what I remember the average class score was super low and therefore really easy to get good scores. <br /><br />Ended up with an A.

So, please be sure to know beforehand. Personally, I am not very interested in the content of the first half semester, but I am acceptable with the content of the second half semester.",

            "comment_content": "Japanese history, from Tokugawa Japan to the Meiji restoration, and up to the end of the Sino-Japanese War. The course covers the political, social and economical changes throughout this period.<br /><br />It was decently interesting as someone who had a prior interest in history, I would not consider it to be boring at all, but if you don't have an interest in politics, and is just looking for some credits, you may find this to be boring.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching was decent, professor He had decent English, and was very open to questions, he welcomes questions during classes, and after classes, where he would respond to your questions promptly through emails.<br /><br />The course has no textbook, so all you have are the powerpoints he makes, which are only just OK.<br /><br />Every lecture has their own powerpoint file, but you can see that for the first 10 pages it is copied from the last lecture's file. Which is annoying when you are trying to study, I recommend downloading the files and then cutting them and export them into PDF files, which helps a lot with studying.<br /><br />There are also some questions in the powerpoints, do not worry as you are not required to know the answers of them, but they sometimes help you in understanding the relationships between different topics, but other times they are almost unnecessary.",
            "comment_grading": "*BASED ON ONLINE TEACHING*<br /><br />50% MIDTERM<br />50% FINALS<br /><br />Both exams have you download a .docx file with the questions on them, and you are given time to answer them. There are 3-4 questions that are very straight-forward as you can find the answers from the powerpoints, since both are open-book, after a bit of searching. The last 2 questions are more what-if questions, you are asked what would have happened given some scenario (such as Japan following the sliver standard instead of gold, or what would happen if Japan lost to China). If you have prior experience with history (such as DSE), these will be very easy.<br /><br />In the end I got an A, compared to the efforts I spent on other courses, an A from studying for only 2 days is quite good. <br /><br />There is fierce competition though, as there are people who would get over 90 marks in exams where the mean is around 60. If you are aiming for A+, grading may not be in your favor.<br /><br />Refer to other reviews for normal assessment methods.",
            "comment_workload": "*BASED ON ONLINE TEACHING*<br /><br />Workload was very light. Just study the powerpoints 1-2 days before the exams, and you would do fine, the exams were open-book so even if you forgot something, you can just look it up. A tip I can give is that you don't have to understand the details, but it is a must to understand the relationships between different aspects (Political, social and economical and how they affect each other)<br /><br />As for the reading, you really don't have to read them, I only read them once and it did not affect my grades or ability to answer questions in the exam, you can pretty much skip them.",

            "comment_content": "The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its &quot;learning from the west&quot;. The lack of appreciation of Japan's economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). It emphasizes the contribution of Japan's indigenous market economy and state-building efforts to Japan's modernization. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan. It provides a more nuanced picture of its modernization, as well as highlight the multiple trajectories of development that were possible in Japan. This course will help the students to view the relationship between Japan and China from a historical perspective.",

The quiz exams your understanding in classes so you have to think second logically. Totally there are 5 quizzes.<br />Before the finals, you have to write an movie review essay - around 9 pages (Times New Roman,12). in one week.
