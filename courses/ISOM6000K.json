Harnessing AIâ€™s potential for competitive performance requires a new type of professionals, who understand how machine learning (ML) works, what they can deliver and how they can be applied into various business context.\n\nThis course is intended to bridge the gap between the business strategy and technical how-to. Through lectures, case discussion, and experiments in real-world data sets, students will gain a broad understanding of ML and AI concepts, explore the state-of-art use cases of AI and ML technology in business, identify new opportunities and potential risks brought by AI, and recognize how to effectively communicate with the data science and machine learning team.",
