        "description": "This course teaches the basic concepts and general modes of action of asymmetric catalysis and synthesis. Asymmetric catalysis is an essential tool in organic synthesis, which is used daily in various industries, such as pharmaceutical, chemical, agriculture, materials, etc. The course will provide in-depth explanation of how catalysts work in organic reactions and how asymmetric control is accomplished in different scenarios. Lectures will focus on mechanistic details of chirality control using case studies. Students are expected to be able to use this important tool to solve various synthetic problems.",
