            "comment_teaching": "Karl's teaching is fun and chill as always. He also has strong interaction with us during lecture (only 19 students this year) so you won't feel bored.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, some teaching materials i.e. some data are quite outdated.",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm (40%):<br />- 1.5hr short essay exam, choose 4 out of 5 questions to answer <br />- Open-book exam and allows internet searching<br />- Thinking-based, memorising PPT is not useful at all <br />- Questions like &quot;Should you invest in this company/product&quot; &quot;How will you transform their business&quot; etc. Knowing about how's the market going on and recent news are important <br /><br />Group Project (60%): <br />- Presentation (30%) including 1-min elevator pitch, 15-mins presentation about your start-up company and 4-mins Q&amp;A session <br />- Business Plan (30%), basically a more in-depth version of your presentation. To be submitted 1 week after final exam period (There's a month apart the presentation and report due date). <br /><br />No marks were disclosed. I think I did poorly in midterm but ended up with A range. Karl is very lenient in terms of grading if you know him well so don't worry.",
            "comment_workload": "No memorisation of hardcore science is needed. Every lesson is like listening to a talk because this course will not require you to recite everything like other LIFS courses but let you know how to develop a business mindset. So it's quite relaxing in general. <br /><br />The only workload is the project but you will have plenty of time to complete it.",
