This general-history course introduces students to China's political, economic, social, and cultural life during the period of 1949-2009. It is a survey of major political, social, and cultural events and changes in China from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the present day. Our goal is to understand the dramatic changes which have happened in mainland China and reshaped Chinese society, economy, politics and culture during this time, paying special attention to the contrast between what happened in the first three decades and in the second three decades of the PRC.",
