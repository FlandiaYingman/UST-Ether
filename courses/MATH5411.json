Central Limit Theorems <br /><br />As a senior UG student at HKUST, I found that the content is very different from what I learned in Math 2421 and other advanced probability or statistics course. So I recommend you should first go and check the content in the textbook. There is basically no calculation, but rather we use analysis to tackle the problem. In this course, we would focus more on the proof l. However, knowledge in advanced probability course definitely help.<br /><br />I think chapter 1 is highly related to the set/measure and chapter 3 is more likely the probability part. If you are not similar to analysis (like me), you would suffer a lot in the early stage. You will find that the notation in chapter 1, such as sigma field, production space, vector, and Borell set is very hard to understand. But “don’t give up”, you would find the content very easy after you get used to it.",

I think it is very smart to spend half of the time on the first part of the content since it is very important, but basic knowledge in this course. Professor did care for students with very few analysis backgrounds/ students from other majors.<br /><br />On top of Professor Bao’s teaching, I think you can also refer to Professor Chen Kani’s lecture notes. The lecture notes are very well organized and it also provides a lot of good exercise with solutions. You can find the related resources on coursehero and studocu.",

I did not do well in the assignments, but I think I did a good job on the final exam and received a good grade in the end. <br /><br />However, I can feel that all students in the class are very smart and diligent.

Course content:<br /><br />========Part One: Measure theory======<br /><br />TL;DR: A crash course in real analysis. Say, you will learn Lebesgue measure without knowing the explicit definition. Some concepts are carefully discussed, but some proofs of important theorems are omitted, like Fubini theorem, Caratheodory extension theorem, Rieman-Lebesgue theorem (for equivalence in compact intervals).

Many variants of weak law of large number<br />-&gt; Variant 1: Uncorrelated, second moment uniformly bounded<br />-&gt; Variant 2: Triangular array, second moment under controlled, no requirement for independence<br />-&gt; Variant 3: Triangular array for truncated r.v.<br />-&gt; Variant 4: Requires xP(|X_n| &gt; x) \\to 0 only<br />-&gt; Original WLLN: Required existence of first moment only<br />xvi.

But anyway, the lectures themselves will be quite self-contained.<br /><br />For instance, one key thing that you will learn is to determine when does a sequence of random variables S_n (after proper centering and scaling) converge weakly / almost surely / in probability, and what are the limits. You might have seen some results when S_n is the sample mean of a given i.i.d. RV sequence X_i, e.g. you may have learnt WLLN, SLLN and CLT in some applied probability course. But this course is going to extend them into more general settings, say, what results we can conclude when X_i are not independent, when X_i are not identically distributed, when X_i does not have first moment, when the quantity of interest S_n is no longer the &quot;average&quot;, and so on.<br /><br />If you have taken MATH2431, you will find that it has many overlaps with this course, but this course will completely omit computational stuffs and focus even more on the proofs and extensions on the limiting theorems (e.g. the techniques of truncation and sparsification). On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that this course is way way way different from an applied probability course (e.g. MATH2421 or its exclusions), as this course will be based on a rigorous measure-theoretic probability framework, in which many concepts and proof techniques in real analysis will appear very often almost surely. If you are UG and have not taken any honor MATH course, I would recommend you to enroll in this course only if you are willing to tackle MATH3033-related stuff.",
            "comment_teaching": "Very clear and well-organized. Instead of providing lecture notes in advance, Prof BAO starts everything from scratch during the class. Moreover, he is not only writing things up line-by-line, but he also gives comprehensive explanations on what's happening behind. For example, besides giving a direct proof to a theorem, he also try to tell us the intuition behind the theorem / proof, and the mindset that we should take away from the proof. These mindsets are really something useful but might not be that easy to gain if we read the textbook directly. I personally think this is the best way to teach MATH courses.<br /><br />Since lecture notes are (intentionally) NOT provided, you should find your own way to address this. As I found myself hard to catch up the content at the same time when I copy Prof BAO's writing in class, what I did is just to listen and take photos of the whiteboard during the class, fill in my own notes after class using the photos and the RVC recordings, and consult the textbook iff further details are needed.<br /><br />Although it is a little bit inconvenient without lecture notes, it is harmless to the overall learning experience.",

Prof BAO said he realized some students want to take advantage from that lenient scheme, so he change it in order to 勸退 some of us. However, it is not a problem for those who are really willing to follow and learn from the course.<br /><br />It turns out that the grading is good!
