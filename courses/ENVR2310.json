        "description": "This course introduces students to basic theories and findings in environmental and health economics. The emphasis is on how the economic models and concepts can be used to analyze environmental and health issues. The course begins with an introduction of theoretical economic concepts and models; then it moves on to several policy-relevant environmental and health topics. Particular issues include externality, common goods and public goods, valuation of environmental goods and health, market failure and health, environmental regulations, pollution and health, and the economics of climate change.",

            "comment_content": "*Only take this course if you have prior economics background!*<br /><br />I studied Economics in high school and I struggled to understand all of it, not because it's difficult but because of the sheer amount of concepts and theories taught. It's especially worsened when there is no midterm - i.e. you have 20 powerpoints of almost 50 pages each to memorize. <br /><br />News Article Analysis replaced the midterm apparently, but tbh I'd rather have a mid term instead.<br /><br />However, putting the amount of content aside, i did find most of the stuff taught pretty interesting. I do recommend this course if you have any interest in environmental policies or politics. Prof didn't dive too deep into those concepts and kept it easy enough to understand.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor was enthusiastic in his teaching, he prepares a lot of materials and additional videos for us. I had a few questions regarding certain topics and he quickly responded to my emails, arranging a meeting first with the TA (who was helpful), and then himself.<br /><br />One thing to note is that his accent is considered a bit on the heavy side - I could understand it but some people may fail to. The TA I met with is from Japanese, and his accent isn't much better either if I'm honest. But again, not so bad that I cannot make out what they're saying. There are definitely worse accents in UST, and by that I mean a lot worse. (Looking at you, Du Lil*n from ISOM department)",
            "comment_grading": "The average score for assignments were quite high, I believe since most people had economics background. Final was rather rushed, so the mean was significantly lower (Prof did mention he didn't expect us to finish all of it - you'll see it reflected in the grade below).<br /><br />Prof gave leng grades (he gave good grades) - after final he handed out his scoring percentages and he used up the quota for A &amp; B (20% and 40% respectively).<br /><br />Assignment 1: 94/100 - Mean 93.4<br />Assignment 2: 93/100 - Mean 88.5<br />Assignment 3: 96/100 - Mean 91.4<br />Assignment 4: 91/100 - Mean 88.8<br />News Article Analysis: 82/100 - Mean 81.8<br />Final Exam: 66/100 - Mean 57.8 - SD: 15.5<br /><br />Final Grade: B+<br /><br />I'm pretty satisfied with his grading.",
            "comment_workload": "There was an assignment every 2 week (total of 4), which isn't too much. One assignment would take about an hour or more to complete but honestly it could've been worse. News Article Analysis had a limit of 6 pages I think so the pressure isn't on you to write as much as you could.<br /><br />In general, the assignments can be completed without much issue if you understood most of what he taught in class. There are some additional mathematical concepts that will be introduced in the assignments but they're easy enough that my dumbass could figure them out on my own.<br /><br />Since there was no mid term, the studying workload for the final is massive (mentioned in Content section).",
