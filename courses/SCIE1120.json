            "comment_content": "This course comprises of 3 main sections taught by 3 professors. As a early third year BCB student, I can say this course is pretty much a summary of many LIFS courses, sometimes even reaching their level of complexity, I personally had to study for it too (I thought it would be an easy A without studying), I have no idea how business, engineering or math students could handle it. <br /><br />Summary of the chapters:<br /><br />Professor Nagl - Biochemistry (directly the same content as LIFS2210 - Biochemistry I, with some more extra physics) <br />- Microscopy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- Chemistry of water<br />- Carbohydrates<br />- DNA <br />- Proteins<br />- Molecular proteins and muscle contraction (this reached LIFS3040 knowledge) <br />- Enzyme <br />- Lipids <br />- Analytical systems (even going to CHEM2311 content ...) <br /><br />Professor Raymond Wong - Origin of life and metabolism (This was a throwback to LIFS2220, especially the part on lipids) <br />- Membrane systems<br />- Food and health<br />- Consuming sugars <br />- Ketogenic diet <br />- Sugar and intelligence <br /><br />Professor Karl Herrup - Biological systems (his part was a throwback to LIFS1902 and a bit about respiration from LIFS2220): <br />- Evolution <br />- Mitochondria (TCA and ETC pathways) <br />- Nervous System<br />- Development <br />- Aging<br /><br />As you can see, they took bits of 3-4 LIFS courses packed into one. LIFS students - particularly BCB has a huge advantage over everyone else because everything in this course has been taught prior. <br /><br />Mid term was basically only Nagl's part (his entire part is exactly the entire course of LIFS2210, he squeezed a whole course into about 11-12 lectures). <br /><br />While the finals were non-cumulative and is Herrup and Wong's part (they alternated randomly when lecturing their chapters) <br /><br />Overall this course would be very overwhelming to non-LIFS students.",
            "comment_teaching": "My rating and comment for each professor: <br /><br />Stefan Nagl (C) <br />- His teaching was okay, but the biggest issue was that he over-estimates how much the students know - he goes straight to LIFS2210 parts assuming all students have prior knowledge already. The pacing was okay for me cuz I already took LIFS2210, but even year 1 LIFS students were struggling, yet alone those form other majors. <br />- He also goes through the material very quickly (legit crammed all of LIFS2210, not even kidding). <br />- Do expect very high level of memorization for his part, as you would need to directly recite them for his essay questions. <br /><br />Raymond Wong (B):<br />- His teaching mainly revolved around diet, fats, sugar and health. <br />- His explanations are good, like he explains a lot of the links between foods, diseases, health threats ... <br />- However he may tend to over-explain and give a lot of details (not all are needed, they can be pretty interesting), some of his slides too list a huge no. of diseases (e.g. consequences of hyperglycaemia). A majority of his extra details or lists are not even examined. <br /><br />Karl Herrup (A+)<br />- Easily the best professor in LIFS (he is at the top position too). <br />- His parts were from his 1902 classes, but he made is much easier and accessible to all students. <br />- Can easily follow through his content, he designed it so its easy to understand. <br /><br />Overall teaching for this course: B, could have been better by focusing on main ideas and concepts of Chemistry and Life rather than huge details.",
            "comment_grading": "50% Mid term (mean was barely a 70%, s.d. was about 10%, the exam was out of 111%, 11% was from bonus) <br />50% Finals (unknown mean or s.d., the exam itself was out of 55, 5% was bonus) <br /><br />Mid-terms exams was fully short questions and essays, he had like 25-26 questions, and this also involved drawing specific amino acids, glucose, protein tertiary structures, DNA nucleotides, enzyme kinetics .... it was intense even for me! <br /><br />Finals was much easier than mid-terms - Wong's part had 12MCQ and 13 Fill in the blanks, Herrup's part was 28 MCQ and 2 FIll in the blanks. <br /><br />What was good is that in both mid-term and finals was that a certain% of it were bonus marks, so some wrong answers previously can be subsided. <br /><br />I put the grading as A because I am a BCB student, as it was the perfect opportunity to leech off the bad grades from students of other majors to get a good grade (I am so sorry...)",
            "comment_workload": "High workload to cram for mid-term content. <br />The workload is much less after mid-terms. <br /><br />Also depends on what your major is, LIFS students have it much easier because they most likely learnt this before, while I have seen some business and math students really struggle and some eventually gave up.",

            "comment_teaching": "prof Nagl: <br />Honestly isn't the most entertaining, sounds as if he is just reading off a script. His Accent could be a little confusing but if you focus just a little bit its fine. The ppts are decent but sometimes there are just paragraphs of explanations rather than bullet points. But since I often skipped the actual lecture- it was online anyways lol- and watched the recorded videos or just read the ppt, I found that the info on the ppts is actually sufficient and I didn't necessarily have to watch the whole lecture video. Helpful if you always cram like I do!<br /><br />Prof Wong:<br />Teaching wise he's mediocre, accent sometimes disturbing but manageable. HOWEVER my biggest problem with him was when he graded our midterm exam. After grades came out I checked which questions I got wrong and why and found that he marked 3 questions that I clearly thought was right to be wrong. I double checked this too before I emailed him. 1 question he admitted to right away but the other 2 questions he just WOULDNT accept that these are the right answers. And these answers were literally on HIS OWN ppt. I screenshotted each ppt slide and showed it to him and all he replied was some bullshit explanation. It wasn't even just me, it was many other students as well. After sending over 5 emails he finally admitted to the second question, but in the end he didn't budge with the third question when so many students were sending him emails about this. Honestly so annoying, guys make sure to always check how you got questions wrong and double check it - and get evidence and tell the professor, even if sometimes your professor may be prof. Wong.",

Or I don't know maybe it wouldn't have made a difference since everyone else's points would also go up.<br /><br />Finals were honestly very unfair because <br />1. Content was VERY EASY (answer choices were copied exactly off from the ppt and such<br />2. Open book + ALLOW GOOGLE SEARCH<br />So like it would actually be dumb NOT to get a good grade on the final. I studied for this course aiming for an A+ and because of this, I felt that students who didn't actually study were all able to do well on the final, so the mean for the final was hella high - I think it was 44/50 ish. <br />I'm happy with my grade but still think that final was basically a legal cheatshow where everyone who didn't study were also able to do well on the exam.

Content was alright to me since I have taken Physics and Chemistry in high school. Only four short ppts, and should be manageable for all students. <br />Prof. Herrup's part: DNA, the nervous system, the immune system and sth related to fertilisation. Only the lecture on DNA was less boring to me .. His ppts are all super long (at least 60 slides per lesson). He told us in the first lecture that he would be gentle to us since most of us aren't science students.. but honestly the content is still too much for non-science students. Indeed struggled quite hard before the midterm exam because of his parts.....<br />Prof Renneberg is from the Chemistry Dept. His topics included metabolism, proteins and enzymes, infections and high speed of science. Classes are quite interactive and lively. <br />All three professors' topics are not quite related, but luckily the final isn't cumulative, so you only have to revise Prof. Wong and Prof. Herrup's parts for the midterm (mainly LIFS), and focus on Prof. Renneberg's parts for the Final (CHEM). <br />Should be pretty easy for science students, but as a business student, the content is simply overloading, esp. for the first half..",

Not much special about this prof.<br />Prof. Herrup is the head of the LIFS Dept and is super demanding. <br />Both of them just read out the slides so not much to say about.<br />Prof. Rennengberg is my favourite among the three. Very funny prof and interesting classes. He prepared movies and other reading materials. He shared his own stories with us and focused on the applications of science, which are much more useful than other prof's lectures.",

Yet, I gave it a C because it's simply unfair not to exempt students who have taken related science courses like LIFS1902 and more advanced Bio/Chem/Biotech courses.

There is a lot of overlap with LIFS courses such as 1902 (General Biology II) and 2040 (Cell Biology).<br /><br />The course content is not at all well structured. The 3 professors all teach different topics and they are not integrated, so it keeps switching from one topic to some completely different one.<br /><br />The level of difficulty is too high for a 1000-level Common Core course meant for students with 'no scientific background'. Because it is mainly a Biology course there is a lot of memorization.",
            "comment_teaching": "The system of 3 professors teaching different topics in the course doesn't work very well for this course because they all teach very different topics, sometimes not related to each other, and all teach in very different styles. Prof. Herrup and Zhu follow a very structured and organized teaching, with clear lecture notes for each of their topics and they usually just explain the slides during the lectures. They both explain the concepts quite clearly and are helpful with any questions.<br /><br />Prof. Renneberg has a very different style of teaching which students either find very enjoyable or very frustrating. He does not follow any structure whatsoever. He almost never follows the given schedule and teaches any topic at any time. During each lecture also there is no structure as he discusses any topics, stories, jokes, facts, etc. No lecture notes are provided at any time and his content is not directly from any textbook so it's almost impossible to revise his content before the exams. Most of his lectures are spent watching him draw cartoons and watching random Hollywood movies (which are actually tested in the exams with 4 or 5 MCQ questions about the plot of the movies).",
            "comment_grading": "Again the structure of this course makes the grading and exams very confusing.<br /><br />Midterm and Final exams, weighting not revealed.<br /><br />Midterm is only MCQs, but Prof. Renneberg's section is multiple-answer MCQs which makes the grading terrible as there is negative marking for missing a correct choice/choosing an incorrect choice.<br />Final has 2 papers, Prof. Herrup's part has mostly MCQs, Prof. Renneberg's part also has 2 long questions which involve drawing and designing some tests.<br />In both exams Prof. Renneberg's questions always include some MCQs about the plot and characters of the Hollywood movies shown in lectures (The Martian, Contagion, etc.) and some about random general knowledge trivia.<br /><br />I got 0.5 SD above mean in midterm, &gt;1 SD above mean in 1st final paper, slightly below mean in 2nd final paper, overall grade B.",
            "comment_workload": "No workload at all. The exams require quite a lot of memorization of the lecture slides for Prof. Herrup and Zhu's parts, can't really prepare for Prof. Renneberg's part.<br /><br />Prof. Renneberg has some optional HW I think which can give you 1 or 2% bonus points.",

DNA, telecommunications in human bodies, viruses).<br /><br />For biology part, basically it's about memorisation of different biological processes. Once you get yourself familiar with the details of each process, it should be easy to answer the questions in the exam.<br /><br />For Chemistry part, you just need to review the concepts Professor Renneberg mentions in class, and his class notes already include everything you will need for the exam.<br /><br />If you don't really like biology or have zero background about biology, this course is not recommended for you as it could be boring and a bit difficult.",
