However, the lecture notes are just disaster. <br />There are many typos within the lecture slides and the professor only corrects those mistakes during lecture time. P.S There are even wrong solutions for both the mock midterm exam and final exam! My advice to the warriors that are planning to take this course is &quot;Don't believe what you see and hear whether it is on the lecture slides or directly coming out from professor's mouth&quot;. Professor himself is a typo.",
