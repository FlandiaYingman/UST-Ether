The workload is low as each group consists of 8-9 people and workload for each individual is very small.<br /><br />Final Performance:<br />He evaluates on effort, not quality.

The musical terms are not hard that a non-musical background person won't be able to understand. <br /><br />Isaac delves quite deep into the opera though, he'll cover the composer, story, musical theory, music style, artistic style and even the social economic background during the time of the opera.",
            "comment_teaching": "Isaac's a really knowledgeable and interesting professor. He's a professional opera singer too so he sometimes sings in class which is always entertaining. He tries to make classes fun and not boring, and you can tell he's really passionate about opera and the arts.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is fair. As long as you show up to class and concert rehearsals, and also do all the work required. <br /><br />The midterm was fairly easy but the final was hard because it quizzes on all the operas covered throughout the entire course.",
            "comment_workload": "Attendance, Opera Review Essay, Light Reading, Watching Operas, IC Review, Midterm and Final. <br /><br />-Attendance of classes and concert rehearsals are required. <br />-There is a final concert in the end which is fun but practice can be time consuming. Isaac isn't so particular about your singing skill, he just wants students to get a taste of performing. <br />-When he's discussing a specific opera, Isaac will give out readings or make us watch the opera on Youtube beforehand so that we know what he discusses in class. <br />-The 1000-word opera review essay isn't so bad, an opera is at least 3 hours long so there's lots of things to discuss<br />-The IC 500-word review are a pain in the ass, the workshops are always too avant-garde and since this is an opera class it's not that easy connecting the content with lecture materials.<br />-The midterm and final questions are fair. He asks about the storyline, theories, and quizzes on the opera music.",

He is willing to talk after-class and he treated students with pizza on the concert day.<br />As for teaching, he is quite humorous in a way that he always try to tell jokes and make students laugh by singing in an &quot;operatic&quot; way. <br />He tried to get the class to be more concentrate by asking you to do a few stretching with him, which is quite unique.<br />The only downside is that his ppt are always having too much words and it is not concise.",

Group assignment : writing programme notes for the final concert (500 words in total for 4-5 ppl)<br />4. hand in one opera review (and you really have to go and watch one)<br />5. Perform in concert at the end of semester (and attend rehearsals): it is fun if you are ok with singing ; not much pressure as the performance won't be graded<br />6. IC ACTIVITIES REVIEW:(",
