The remaining topics include geophysical methods using EM or mechanical waves... This a practical and useful course that you can really see something &quot;real&quot;. Only offered once in two years so it’s reli a great opportunity if you can take this course!",

Although the lecture is 3-hr long, the professor is still energetic and willing to answer questions even though after giving a long talk. Only reading the lecture notes is not enough: attending the lectures is more important as many explanations / extra contents were only taught in class.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a good professor !",
