        "description": "This course serves as an introduction of modern data analysis to students from mathematics and as well as engineering. It starts from two stories opening the high dimensional statistics; Stein's phenomena in high dimensional estimate and random matrix theory in principle component analysis, then paves a way toward the central role of sparse structures in modern data analysis. Compressed sensing, manifold learning, and a variety of topics in machine learning are discussed with a data analytic orientation. The course has no exams, but is featured with extensive homework and projects. Familiarity with a programming language such as MatLab, R, or Python is needed. Basic knowledge on linear algebra and optimization is helpful.",
