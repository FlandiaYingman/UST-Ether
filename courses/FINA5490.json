        "description": "This course is a follow-up of FINA 5390 Venture Capital and Private Equity, with a particular focus on early-stage venture companies. Students will be able to experience and practice all the learned materials, particularly those related to the venture capital (VC) endeavors, in real-world VC settings. Students will “invest” alongside VC practitioners as well as being guided by them on various topics such as screening prospective investee companies in a live pitch session and drafting and compiling due diligence lists, term sheets, the required closing documentations, and valuation assessments, in addition to presenting early-read memos to industry professionals (e.g., members of the investment committee (IC)) for deal approvals, among other topics. The professor will frequently relate concepts discussed in class to transactions currently in the news to illustrate their application and limitations.",
