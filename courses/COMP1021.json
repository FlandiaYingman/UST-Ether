The questions are extremely weird and try to trick you, for example by multiplying a number by 2 but they made the number a string instead of an int. You have to be extremely careful. The mean this semester was 48.57 with s.d 19.29.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can see the final as a typing test and just type out all the code they don't let you copy. If you are fast enough at typing (at least 90-100wpm) then this is actually a viable option for you, and makes the final much less stressful.<br /><br />My scores:<br />Lab 1 - 80%<br />Lab 2 - 100%<br />Lab 3 - 100%<br />Mterm: 90%<br />Final: 100% (after grading change)<br /><br />Overall: ~97% (definitely enough for A+)<br /><br />It is quite difficult to get an A/A+ even if you've already programmed before, because the exams basically are a human aptitude test or a geometry test disguised as a Python exam. There are only one or two questions where you use Python to solve a problem. They purposely make the tests tricky and weird because too many people going into this course can already program so they had to &quot;fix the curve&quot; somehow",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is extremely light.<br /><br />7 labs + 1 intro lab, 3 of which are handed in and also graded. Non-graded labs do not have to be done but I recommend at least skimming them as they often re-use lab content in the final exams.<br /><br />The actual labs are easy, as long as you know how to read instructions and do some basic programming.",

The content is based on the lecture notes on the course website but not the textbook I have mentioned before.<br /><br />Each lab is about 110 minutes, I was unfortunately enrolled in the 9:00am to 10:50pm session. There would be exactly one topic for every lab session. Sometimes the content could be taught a little earlier than the lectures, but for most of the time, what you see in labs have been taught before.<br /><br />Very basic things about Python. In the last two lectures, Rossiter mentioned Objects and Recursion, I suppose these are for the 201X series?",

Since I usually choose to finish the code using course materials before the class, I can hardly tell whether the instructors' teaching style is good or not. <br /><br />All instructors and TAs are prepared for my questions and I can get my answer for most of the time.",

The mid-term exam was delayed for 30 minutes because too many people accessing the website at once and could not get into the monitoring zoom meetings. Canvas was also a disaster for online exam. For some reason, we couldn't go back to the previous question once we hit next. And I shit you not, they put the hardest question at question 2. WTF was I supposed to do? My friend and I literally stuck on this one for ages and he ending up not finishing 2 out of the 6 questions in part A. And I accidentally clicked the &quot;next&quot; button without finishing a question. Fml<br /><br />TL;DR :<br />1. The online exam experience was terrible. <br />2. Make sure don't accidentally click the &quot;next&quot; or &quot;submit&quot; button as next semester are likely to be online exam as well and are likely to be using this shit system aka canvas as well.",

Not too difficult to handle, especially the first few weeks which cover basic programming concepts like moving the turtle, if/else/elif, loops etc. A bit similar to basic programming content covered in ICT syllabus, but it's not too hard even if you don't have much programming background or prior knowledge. Notes and examples are detailed and quite helpful in illustrating the concepts.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor mainly uses examples to teach us the concepts in class. It is good that we get to see different ways to apply to knowledge and see the concepts in action. He teaches with heart and really tries hard to make classes fun and lively. He is also very helpful and often patiently explains concepts in detail to students both in class and after class. Sometimes he does not explain certain important concepts clearly enough, but it's fine as long as you read the notes yourself or approach him after class.",
            "comment_grading": "This semester we had special arrangements, with assignments taking up most of the marks. I think you need around 97-98 to enter A range this semester. All the averages are so high (except for the midterm) so you must make sure you get it all correct before you submit your assignments.<br /><br />Professors provided two grading methods:<br />Method 1<br />Assignments x2 (35% x2)<br />Midterm (10%)<br />Online assignment (20%)<br />Method 2<br />Assignments x2 (25% x2)<br />Midterm (35%)<br />Online assignment (15%)<br />+ bonus points (mine was up to 1.5)<br /><br />The two assignments are not too difficult because a beginning code is given to help you and a big part of it is done during the labs, so if you go to the labs and ask your friends it should be generally fine. The mean is usually around 90.<br /><br />The online assignment is like an online quiz with multiple choice questions and short questions except we were given many days to do it, and many of the answers can be obtained by running the programs directly or testing the programs, so it was not hard to get high marks, again the average was around 90.<br /><br />The midterm was not too difficult (open book), but the time given was a bit too short and each of the questions take up many marks, one small careless mistake can cost you 6 marks which will make a big difference in your grade. Luckily, there is an option where your midterm only counts for 10%. Also by all means try to get your bonus points they might send you up 1-2 subgrades!!!!<br /><br />Grading should be better during normal semesters though.",

Because the test is examining your logic, not syntax. The book doesn't teach you logic. You will waste lots of time in reading book during test.<br /><br />2. practice your logic. As I mentioned, logic is the main point. You can google &quot;sorting algorithm&quot; or &quot;binary search algorithm&quot; and learn it, I still remember the mid-term asked somethings about sorting, and final asked about searching.<br /><br />3. test specific cases. Like some list functions, E.g. test remove() will remove more than one elements or not, and will it has a return.",

For some reason, we couldn't go back to the previous question once we hit next. And I shit you not, they put the hardest question at question 2. WTF was I supposed to do?

Many people got a full score on this. (mean: 71.9)<br />Finals: The final is absolute hell. It is impossible to finish all of the questions since reading the questions itself will already take all of your time. After the test, you will feel like you want to jump out of the building and kill yourself. (mean: 48.57) <br />Lab: The lab is also easy to complete since there is a video to guide you all the way through. However, be very careful on checking your work before submitting because most of the labs are automatically graded by the computer and if you make one simple mistake, it will ruin your grade. The mean though, is always close to 100. <br /><br />My scores:<br />Midterm: 78 <br />Finals: 56 <br />Lab: 100 <br /><br />Final grade: B+ <br /><br />I am actually pretty satisfied with my grade since I think my scores are not that high above the mean :)",

You don’t need any CODE computer background, visualized computer programming like Scratch or LEGO EV3 is much more enough. <br /><br />REMEMBER, LOGIC IS THE KEY. <br />There aren’t many advanced elements in this class, I think it accumulates students LOGIC. <br /><br />For a question, SET YOUR GOAL, THINK LIKE A COMPUTER.",

HOWEVER, TAKING MID IS RECOMMENDED. So you can know how did you learn in the previous part (because they are basic things that cannot be skipped in the final)<br /><br />Lab: most student get 100 so please ensure you do it carefully.

Content include basic commands and variables, turtles, if-else statements, for loops and while loops etc. All are straight-forward and not hard to understand. The harder part starts at the loops and turtle. It may take some thinking to understand if you are not following the code closely. But in general its not hard.<br /><br />The labs are very friendly as well. The TAs guide you step by step and explain things very well. You can ask questions after every part and they will answer and solve your problems very patiently. The content of the labs and assignments are quite fun as well. Good stuff.",

One of the biggest gems of this course.",

The midterm is worth around 30%, final 50% , and labs 20%<br />2. The final worth 60% and labs 40%<br /><br />You should focus on doing well in the midterm so it doesn't all fall upon the final.",

The small mistakes take a lot out of the entire mark because there are no partial credits and there are not a lot of questions.<br /><br />The midterm and the final both were taken online and I suggest that you sign up for the quiet room if possible because it just gets rid of all the hassle to show your surroundings with the camera.

But it is still very easy to lose points in examinations due to carelessness. I didn't get full marks in the mid-term examination because of that. Luckily, the second scheme doesn't count mid-term, and I got full marks in all labs and final examinations so I get A+.<br /><br />This semester's mean mark is so high for the final examination and turns out the cutoff is very very high. I would say I am just lucky enough to get full marks this time. But the grade is still very bad for most people.<br /><br />I recommend you take the exams in the quiet rooms even if they give you the option to take that on Zoom (if you are just taking that yourself:)) because it is really easy to get mark penalties if you do it on Zoom.",

They only took you several hours each even if you didn't learn programming before.<br /><br />If you have learnt programming before and understand, you can finish them easily in one hour each, which is approximately zero workload.<br /><br />Be careful about the deadline though. Don't miss the deadline for the hand-in labs. It would be an automatic zero if you miss the deadline. And check the marking scheme carefully so you don't lose points.",

Before the semester started, I simply watched a 4-hours beginner course of Python on YouTube during the summer. So, you can get a good grade for 100% sure if you have similar background.<br /><br />For this course, what you really need to pay attention to is the coding part. You need to write codes step-by-step and by yourself. Don't ask your friends or your instructors at the beginning, ask Google instead.

This time he use the camera requirement to deduct 10 marks, next time you may be penalized 80 marks as you use python 3.10.5, not 3.10.4. The exam details should clearly state every requirement and its penalty. He cannot argue with this point so he just said 'we cannot give you special treatment' and reduced the penalty for all students by half. But still, this unclarity should not happen. ) After the penalty(deducted 5 marks on the final), I got only 93.6/100 overall. And my grade is A-.

If you want to get good results, finishing all the past papers twice is highly recommended. The first time helps you to understand the method and logic to complete that question type while the second time allows you to make sure how to utilize the principles and logic. <br /><br />Most importantly, there will probably don't have enough time for you to finish every question. Hence, please try to time yourselves when doing the past papers to test your limit. Even though you can finish the past papers nicely, please don't be too proud of yourselves.

The exam is definitely hard and challenging and does require a good understanding and ability to apply the content. <br /><br />The curve is fair for the final and midterm and there are various grading formulas and the highest grade is chosen after all this. I think that is the bright side to this. Doing well on the labs and midterm would help you compensate for a shitty final. <br /><br />For me the final went terribly, it was one of the worst exams I could ahve imagined. The irony was that i did infact revise and spend hours flipping through my notes and practicing. since my labs were all complete and I ended up with aa&nbsp;&nbsp;100% there and my midterm was satisfactory, the final didn't hurt me too much.

He also replies to emails. There is a textbook for this course, but I think lecture notes are useful and comprehensive enough. All in all, I think he is a great teacher.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think COMP1021 is a well-established course. The course website lists out all useful materials (lecture notes, examples, interactive examples, recordings, zoom video links etc.) in an clear and organized way. Pastpapers with answers and video explanations will be released before exams.

            "comment_content": "An introduction to Computer Science which covers data types(ints, strings, bools), handling of data types via lists, loops, tuples, functions, etc. The course also goes into some operators such as the Modulus operator. <br /><br />Basically, everything is centered around the turtle phylon graphics engine which is fairly weird as your gonna use it in this course and then never again. Why the course puts such a heavy emphasis on Turtle graphics is a mystery to me &amp; if I'm honest I'm pretty sick of seeing it. All in all a pretty decent syllabus but if you've not used/heard of the turtle graphics engine before id get familiar with it as all of your Labs are linked to it one way or another.",
            "comment_teaching": "I liked Wilfred a lot, he's a very good teacher who does a good job at explaining the workings of the code. He strictly explains the examples from the Lecture presentation so take that as you wish. He answers emails fairly fast &amp; has a pretty good accent for UST standards (cough cough math department).",
            "comment_grading": "Labs:<br />Grading for this course was all over the place and fairly poor overall. The labs make up between 36% &amp; 42% of your final grade which is very heavy given that basically everyone gets 100% on them. The grading for most of the labs is automatic so make sure to read the instructions carefully. <br /><br />Midterm:<br />The midterm was pretty easy making up 24% or 0% of your grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the average is fairly high I studied for it and got a satisfactory grade.<br /><br />Final:<br />The final is HELL and is more of a reading comprehension exam than anything else. It makes up between 40% to 58% of your grade so you definitely don't want to mess that one up. The explanation for the questions is extremely long so your gonna have a serious advantage if you are a fast reader &amp; can type fast aswell. I personally wasn't able to complete the final because I'm a fairly slow reader and straight-up didn't have enough time to read the last 2 questions. <br /><br />Grading formula:<br />The only reaming thing about the grading in this course is that it uses 2 formulas to calculate your grade &amp; takes the higher result of the 2 as your final score.<br /><br />Formula 1: Midterm 24% , Lab 36%, Final 40%<br />Formula 2: Midterm 0%, Lab 42%, Final 58%",
            "comment_workload": "As stated before the only real workload is the labs, take your time with those to make sure that you will get full marks. Furthermore, I learned a lot through challenging myself with little projects which was a fairly fun way to learn.",

The focus will be on topics like if/else statements, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, recursion, and a brief intro to objects. Things like these are gonna pop up in other programming languages so it really gives you that mindset. There is also a large focus on using Turtle Graphics, so make sure you're familiar with that. <br /><br />They definitely teach you from zero and assume you don't have prior knowledge in programming, so don't worry if you don't know programming but want to enroll in this course. I didn't know programming before this course and the contents were quite easy to grasp.",
            "comment_teaching": "Sung was amazing. Some other reviews on here complain about his accent but I think it was fine. It sounded kinda cute too. Sung makes his lectures interesting and I've never slept in his lectures. I couldn't say the same about other lecturers. Sung also interacts with the class by asking us questions. He also does demonstrations in class which makes what we're learning very clear. <br /><br />Big props to David (course coordinator) too and actually the whole COMP1021 team for making all the course materials readily available online. The revision materials are super comprehensive, super neat, and super easy to find. There are also lots of interactive exercises on the website for us to familiarize ourselves with the concepts we've learned and put what we've learned into practice, which is very nice because education is supposed to be two-wayed.<br /><br />If you are a fast learner, I'd definitely suggest Sung. He doesn't assume you have prior programming knowledge, but he goes through content faster than David and Gibson. He also teaches extra things that might help improve your programming skills, which is a bonus if you're thinking of learning more COMP in the future. But if you are not a fast learner and think you're bad with things like programming, I'd suggest David and Gibson. I've sat in their lectures before and they go through concepts slowly, but more clearly. They're probably the pick for people who think they might struggle.",

But then again almost everyone gets 100 for lab so it doesn't give you much of an edge.<br /><br />The final is kind of like the be-all and end-all. Even though the exams are online and open-book, they make it purposefully short so Googling your answers would be a waste of time. The final had a mean of like 48 so I guess a lot of people tripped up on that, not because the questions were hard, but because of the time. <br /><br />I will not reveal my grade but I have to say I was quite happy with what I got, considering I have no programming background prior to taking the course.",

(true story D:). The labs usually have a mean of 90-100 with s.d 8-10.<br /><br />The midterm is fairly easy, as long as you're somewhat careful and double-check your answers. If you've done programming, you should have at least half the time to check your answers. Exams are done remotely this semester. Mean was 71.9 with s.d about 21.4.<br /><br />However, the final is hell. There is barely enough time for you to check your answers. The questions are extremely weird and try to trick you, for example by multiplying a number by 2 but they made the number a string instead of an int. You have to be extremely careful. The mean this semester was 48.57 with s.d 19.29.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can see the final as a typing test and just type out all the code they don't let you copy. If you are fast enough at typing (at least 90-100wpm) then this is actually a viable option for you, and makes the final much less stressful.<br /><br />My scores:<br />Lab 1 - 80%<br />Lab 2 - 100%<br />Lab 3 - 100%<br />Mterm: 90%<br />Final: 100% (after grading change)<br /><br />Overall: ~97% (definitely enough for A+)<br /><br />It is quite difficult to get an A/A+ even if you've already programmed before, because the exams basically are a human aptitude test or a geometry test disguised as a Python exam. There are only one or two questions where you use Python to solve a problem. They purposely make the tests tricky and weird because too many people going into this course can already program so they had to &quot;fix the curve&quot; somehow",

So, I reckon that 90% is about the A range.<br />The exams are not about writing the code but giving you the code and kind of decoding it. So the logic is very important.",

It is very easy to get a high grade if pay attention in class.<br />The labs are very easy, there are videos to show you how to do it and many hard parts and setting up has already been written by the professor before it is sent to students.

Definitely need to use much time and effort to make yourself familiarize with the techniques so as to handle the midterm and final",
            "comment_teaching": "The style of teaching is quite flexible <br />It's not required to attend class and video recordings from all lectures will be put on the course website for revision so you can compare which lecturer's way of teaching is more suitable for you. Even if you don't tend to attend lessons, you can compare them easily by viewing the ppt about course details. They make a diagram to let students know the characteristics of each lecturer lol<br /><br />In my opinion, I would recommend everyone to attend Gibson's lesson as I found that he can manage to explain theories short yet clear. He talked in a straightforward manner and you could easily understand what the theory is about. But other teachers are nice too.",

The programs in the questions are always long and after you have spent time looking over the meaning of the program, you are already exhausted. I would say this course require a lot of logical thinking which you need to try to train yourself to think fast and carefully.",

            "comment_grading": "This course in spring 2020-2021 was conducted online and I've already forgotten a lot of the specific details so beware xD.<br /><br />I believe there were 4 hand-in labs and they were easy to get full marks in, given the amount of instruction and guidelines. The most complex lab I would say is the robot getting out of a maze because it does require a clear, logical mindset because you are dealing will a lot of if-statements, and the code also had to be robust enough to complete most mazes (They test your code by giving the robot random mazes). You also get quite some time to complete these lab. So generally speaking, you should be able to get high marks here.<br /><br />The mid-term and final on the other hand were quite challenging.<br />Most questions revolves around code analysis. So basically you have the decide whether that given code will execute without error, what that output might be, etc. We were allowed to copy and run certain codes given, but more challenging questions forbid that. You really have to understand what most line of codes are doing and how they interact with each other, while painting a picture in your head of what the output might be (because it often involves Turtle graphics) to be able to do more challenging questions. <br /><br />I would say the time given in these exam was quite limited, but it is possible to do all questions with enough practice of coding stuff / doing past papers.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure about grading, but it might be heavily skewed by people who already have programming experience.<br /><br />In the end, I got full marks on all labs, except the robot maze one.<br />I got only 1 question wrong in mid-term and full marks on final.<br />So I got A+.",

There isn't really tricky question meant to trick you into losing marks and all the question makes sense.<br /><br />Also there are two grading system that are meant to assist students who slip up in midterm. You don't need to worry about getting a very bad grade even if you perform badly at midterm.<br /><br />Grading scheme 1:<br />Assignment 1 + 2: 25% + 25%<br />Midterm: 35%<br />Online assignment: 15%<br /><br />Grading scheme 2:<br />Assignment 1 + 2: 35% + 35%<br />Midterm: 10%<br />Online assignment: 20%<br /><br />The better grading scheme will be automatically used for you to get the best result.<br /><br />Also there are bonus marks for student who answer question in lecture for a maximum of 3 marks.<br /><br />I get full marks in both assignment 1 + 2 and the online one. For midterm I get 90/100. I also get 3 extra marks for answering question in lecture. Got an A+ so I would say it is very good grade course.",

There are lab session but they don't require attendence and are just glorified copy and paste work where you follow the lab assistance's code.<br /><br />The two programming assignment are basically the same thing. You can copy almost all of the program code from the lecture note. Since the skeleton code is provided, it is basically fill in the blanks until you get the results.<br /><br />You have ample time to finish the little things that you need to do and you can easily get full marks just by getting the needed output.",

In most lectures, you only need to learn a few lines of new functions, and you can understand everything easily just by looking at the lecture slides. The only topics that take a little more time to understand are object and recursion.",
            "comment_teaching": "Cecia is a nice lecturer and she teaches every topic in the course with great details and lots of examples, so you can understand everything easily even if you have never tried programming before. She is also willing to answer questions patiently after class. The lectures are a bit boring though because the explanation of things takes too long, especially for topics which are not hard to understand.",
            "comment_grading": "There is 2 grading scheme for this course:<br />Midterm 24%, Lab projects 36%, Final exam 40%&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br />Midterm 0%, Lab projects 42%, Final exam 58%<br />The final score would be the highest out of these two calculation methods.<br /><br />Lab projects: They are just simple programming assignments, and for the 7 lab assignments only 3 of them are hand in labs that count for grades. For each of the lab would provide a step-by-step explanation of nearly everything on the website. Also, you can ask for help from the TAs during tutorial sessions to finish those Labs. This result in a very high average score for the Lab projects: <br />lab 2 average 97.4<br />lab 4 98.4<br />lab 6 90.9<br />Since the significant portion of labs in grades and the high average of the labs, it is very very important to hand in the labs on time. Missing one of the labs would cause a drop of at least 2 subgrades.<br />(Btw remember NOT to share your lab codes with your classmate and friends, I heard that some people have their lab score voided with grade penalty in addition because of code plagiarism)<br /><br />For the exams, they are open book and you can visit the course webpage look for notes, also we are allowed to use Python during the exam. Some of the codes can be copied while you need to manually type the codes for some. Having fast typing speed is definitely an advantage in the exam.<br /><br />Midterm exam covers the first half of the course and is quite simple, for most questions you can just type the code provided and then obtain the answer. here are the stats:<br />Maximum: 100<br />Minimum: 13<br />Mean: 74.6<br />SD: 17.9<br /><br />The final exam covers everything and is significantly more difficult than the midterm, not only due to the increased difficulty of the last few topics, the complexity of the questions also raised a lot. There is a question that requires you to copy a large chunk of code by hand, and there are also questions that provide you more than 20 options and ask you to pick the correct one. This makes the whole exam so demanding. The average of the final is notably lower than the midterm. Stats:<br />Maximum: 100<br />Minimum: 0<br />Mean: 60.59<br />SD: 22.28<br /><br />Overall I think the grading of this course is great. I got a full mark for labs, +1sd for midterm, and +1.8sd for final. Finally get an A+",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is near nil. The first two labs only take around an hours to finish and the last one takes 2 hours. Also the exams are open book, which means you only need to briefly know the functions taught, without the need to memorize them.",

And each note only explain one theory . So it will be easy to handle. However there will be some non hand-in labs. Better done it also because these labs contain contents not included in the lessons.

You'll probably be entertained by his lectures. I've only watched two videos of his lectures and found them very useful.<br /><br />Lessons involve quite a bit of demonstrations, so it's not overrun by powerpoint-reading like some other courses. Their English is fluent and can be understood easily. Overall, my experience with this course's lectures are positive and I think they're of a high quality.",

Lab averages are really high though because a lot of people score full.<br /><br />The midterm exam wasn't difficult in my opinion, and this seems to match what other people think. It might not be as easy if you don't have any programming experience, but I don't think it's very harsh on beginners.<br /><br />The final exam was hellish. Rossiter did say that they were pressured to do harder final exams (understandable, since we have access to Python, which makes everything easier), so past papers didn't really reflect the difficulty of the exam. There was an error with one of the questions and they gave us marks for that, which helped a bit.<br /><br />Here's a bit of statistics from this semester's exams:<br />Midterm: Avg 64.4%, SD 21.5%<br />Final: Avg 55.9%, SD 20.5%<br />*weakest question in each part of midterm/final were removed iirc<br /><br />Grades for reference:<br />Lab 100%<br />Midterm ~90%<br />Final ~60%<br />Letter Grade: A-",

It takes quite a bit of time, but the instructions given on the website are more than enough for you to complete it.<br />There are other labs and you're encouraged to go through them yourself, but you could skip them if you really don't have time. the only annoying part about labs is that **the hand-in date depends on your lab day while the materials are released on the same day for everyone. That means people who have assigned lab sessions on Friday essentially have a few more days to work on their programs than those assigned to Monday sessions. Definitely start early because:<br />1) It's not something you want to deadline-rush<br />2) You should try to secure 100% in all labs because most people do",

            "comment_content": "Python language, mainly focus on turtle. Not that useful for those who are really into coding aspect, but it would help you equip a very basic concept of programming, just not much for the application side. For/While loop is one of the most important elements learnt from the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Good delivering skills, good english. Alex is willing to answer questions and even overruns the lectures sometimes. Some student would find it's a bit fast after midterm, but probably because of the difficulty increases.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading to me is not good, I used the scheme which only counts the final (final 58% and lab 42%). I score full mark in lab and 87.14% in final, overall grade is around 92.5%. But guess what, I just got an A, I would accept if the mean is like 70 or 80, but the mean in final was 55.9, SD around 20, scoring 1.5SD above. Therefore, getting an A+ in HKUST is not really an easy thing to achieve, good luck to you who will register this course.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is fine, just three labs overall. The last lab about robot is a bit challenging, make sure to ask more, watch videos and think more. Some questions in the lab appear in the final. If you pay attention to the lesson, it would take you less time to revise for the finals, even without any background knowledge. But if you did not attend lectures, it would be tough because the final exam is really challenging, you cannot score high even you revise well by doing past papers.",

It will help a lot for your grades.<br /><br />Some questions in final demand you to make a program to get to the answer. Even if they don't, knowing how to make a simple program to find the answer helps a lot. So try to get familiar with programming in Python so that you know what and how to code in different occasions. <br /><br />It's about understanding than memorizing. All course materials and even the internet are accessible during both final and midterm but they are not so useful due to limited time, so try to memorize all functions and grammar.",

The midterm is extremely easy compared to the finals. The mean of the midterms is closer to about 80 whereas the mean of the finals was actually closer to 40.

Expect to be studying with peers who also have prior knowledge in the course.",

The pace of the lecture was adequate, and if you already have some background knowledge of programming, you may even find the lecture as boring. However, even if you miss out on the lectures, it is recommended that you do not miss out on the lab sessions. During the lab sessions, the tutor does a demo so that you can try using the code yourselves with a computer. The lab session is basically copying the code that the tutor writes, but it does help you understand the content much more easily. Also, the tutor does the demonstration of the lab really quickly, so if you do not review your course material or daydream during the lab sessions, you may miss out on an important part that may affect your program overall. Moreover, the tutor does not go back and tell you what the code was even if you ask them, so you should be vigilant at all times.

Also, the assignments were basically giving you free points, so getting a full mark on the assignments and the online assignment was not a big problem.

You access libraries such as the turtle library and time library, which allows you to create some basic yet cool programs. The powerpoint slides are usually quite succinct and only contain the necessary information, which is nice when studying. The tutorials are fun and nice to do because they test your own problem-solving skills sometimes, although a lot of the times the code is basically given to you through the resources given which is nice as well as you don't spend too long trying to figure out the code you need.",

In the end, it is replaced with answering questions regarding details in the online lectures.<br /><br />Overall comments:<br />The grading is not that good in this semester. All the averages are so high that the deciding factor of your grade comes down to the carefulness. You probably need around 97-100 overall to get A range, which may be easy for those who have a programming background but hard for the others.",

No attendance is taken during lectures and labs.<br /><br />For someone who has a programming background, it's perfectly fine to skip all lectures and labs, and go to the exams with just a Python cheat sheet from Google. But for those who are new to programming, it may be time-consuming to familarise themselves with the new concepts.",

I had some programming experience in high school, which was very helpful, but there are lots of people who don’t have experience and still do well. If you are interested in the subject and willing to work hard, this class is very doable. There are tons of office hours, which you should go to right away if you are confused, especially at the beginning of the semester because computer science builds on itself. My advice is to start the projects early (seriously, look at the prompt before class and then try to do half of it by the next class and then finish before the deadline) and get help often. You might want to look at some online coding courses before hand, but it isn’t necessary. Many people take this class having never looked at code before in their life and are fine, but it is definitely harder because coding is a new way of thinking that might not work for you. Also, it is important to go to class because there were several questions on the final that are based on programs we went over in class but weren’t explained in the textbook.",

Topics covered include:<br /><br />1. Basic turtle graphics<br />2. For loops, while loops<br />3. Lists, tuples, strings and dictionaries<br />4. Defining functions<br />5. Window screen events<br />6. Basis in object-oriented programming<br />7. Recursion",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching was great. Prof. Rossiter's lectures were interesting and fun. He frequently asked questions in class so that you can get more practice in reading and understanding programs and codes. This certainly helped to consolidate materials taught in the lectures.<br /><br />There are two TAs responsible for each lab session. They will guide you to complete the lab project step-by-step. However, you may skip all lab sessions if you think you can complete them on your own.",

In my opinion, the course grading is excellent. It is quite easy to score full mark in lab projects as they are really simple, and the lab TA will show you almost all the codes you need for your lab project.<br /><br />Midterm and final are easy (compared to other courses I have taken) but just quite tricky. Getting 80% or above is not hard if you are careful enough. Both midterm and final are open book, so they really test on your understanding of the logic of the programs.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is very light.<br /><br />There is a lab project every week but only the odd-numbered ones are graded. In other words, there are altogether 8 lab projects in which 4 are graded. The lab projects are not hard at all and can be completed in less than 2 hours.<br /><br />Since the midterm and final exams are both open-book, there is no need for any memorization. It is recommended that you should try understanding the logic of different codes through lab projects, or even try to design and write a program of some simple games. By doing so, studying for this course will be much fun.",

The lab time can also be halved if he use correction tools like grammarly or what so ever.<br />Though these instructors are nice guys, the documents can all be found online, and in most time they are just showing you through, so I cannot say this is high-quality teaching.",

If you want more challenge, go get COMP1021P or take the C language waiver to start from COMP2011.<br /><br />Only two assignments, each lasts about two weeks. It wouldn't be too hard if you put time into it even if you're just a beginner. Very detailed program structure was given to students so you can count on that if you need help.

The content itself is interesting, really, but you will only enjoy the content as much as I do if you do not struggle with the it. I can see that some really effort must have been put into selecting those interesting interactive examples which demonstrates what you can do by coding, but as far as I can tell, some of them are too complicated for new programmers to understand. Just like the final assignment a 500+LOC simple game which requires some serious planning job is just too much for some new learners to do on their own",

I will not comment on how efficient the content was delivered during the course since I basically learned the python needed for the course just after an long afternoon in the library when I get the textbook, but if you have to take the course, I personally recommend Gibson over all other instructors.",

The questions in general are not difficult per se but can be tricky, so it's worth looking closely and thinking carefully about them and checking your steps if you have time at the end.<br /><br />As for the two assignments: their weighting is significant and most people do very well, so make sure to follow the markscheme/spec very closely.",

            "comment_content": "This course discusses basic stuff about Python 3.6. Including basic syntax (e.g. write,input),iteration statement(for-loop,while-loop),selection statement(if-then-else),l-system,precedence and recursion. It is quite easy and if you pay attention to the course you should be good to go. If you have programming background this should be an easy course.<br /><br />Highly recommend to all student who studies ICT (elective D) in secondary school to take this course. It should be very easy to you since the knowledge in Pascal/other language other than Java (Just study 1022P if you learn Java before) can somewhat translate into Python (though not all of them). Some new stuff (e.g. recursion, l-system) may be harder to understand but if you put attention on the lecture and have some revision, you should be good to go.",
            "comment_teaching": "To be honest, Mr. Lam's teaching is quite boring. Especially to someone who knows programming to a certain extent. His English is quite clear and you can understand him quite easily. But he spends a lot of time explaining stuff that is actually very easy. This makes his lecture a bit boring.",

You just need to take some time to work on them. Also, both exam is open book, so there shouldn't be much trouble on the exam. There will also be a set of revision notes provided before final exam(can be brought into final exam of course) so you can put all your effort in the final exam even if you failed in the mid-term exam.<br /><br />But since this course is quite an easy course, the mean is also very high. You will need a high mark to get into A-range (~&gt;90). Getting full marks on assignments are essential since they are quite easy. There will also be lab sections where you just work on the assignment, you ask the TA for help when you face any problems or difficulties. <br /><br />The lecturer will also ask questions during lessons. If you answer them correctly (which, you should because the lecturer will help you even if you aren't quite sure about the answer), you will get some extra mark that will contribute to your assignment marks. (You can't get higher than full marks, this is only useful if you can't get full marks in the assignment)",

In this semester we have only 1 hour to finish the paper, and comparatively the paper is not really short.<br /><br />Final:<br />Tricky and difficult. For some questions what I can really do is pure guessing.<br /><br />Generally, the use of various data structures (lists, tuples, dictionary) with looping and L-systems with recursion are the main points in this semester.

There’s lectures and lab every week, no attendance is taken though. Skipped two of the lectures, and two of the labs. You can self study lecture notes if you miss the lecture. For lab, the detailed instructions are posted on the lab website, so no worries if you accidentally skipped it. By the way, lab 3 and 4, 7 and 8 (I skipped these two) are related to the assignments. You will eventually use code written in lab to complete the assignments.<br /><br />Code for assignment 1 (use turtle graphics and pygame midi module to implement a fairly simple “music player”) can be written in less than a day, since they really provide a lot of guidance in the assignment document. But be sure to spend (possibly a lot of) time to test the program!<br /><br />Assignment 2 (use turtle graphics to implement a space shooter game) will take more time to complete. Searching for game materials to use, and editing them, might take as much time as writing the code. I spend a few days on assignment 2, possibly because I prefer working in a relaxed mode. Just don’t procrastinate and you will be fine for both assignments. You can always approach TA to seek help in completing assignments, they are very willing to help. But as the deadline gets closer, they might be very busy because many students need their help.<br /><br />Midterm and final are open book and open notes examinations, so you will be fine provided that you are familiar with the materials, and understand the concepts.",

The programming language taught here is Python, which has a simpler syntax as compared to other languages like Java or C++.

It will be worth 0 percent of the course to you. In this situation, the marks distribution used used would be:<br />Midterm 0%<br />Assignment-1 28.25%<br />Assignment-2 28.25%<br />Final exam 43.5%<br />So based on this, it is lenient to an acceptable level.",

It's mostly about turtle graphics, looping, if statements, lists, recursion, and other topics covered in the exams. I strongly suggest not just simply going over all the PowerPoint slides for revision but watching the lecture videos instead. Sometimes there are only little things in the slides but the professors might elaborate a lot on them in class.<br /><br />Finals are on a higher level of difficulty. Do not expect finals to be easier than midterms as it discusses about class and recursion. I personally find this the most challenging topic to comprehend at first glance apart from looping and if statements. But just like any other topic, just do enough interactive practices and past papers (mostly past papers because I think they are more helpful than interactive practices) at https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp1021/.",

Moreover, the projects are easy since the templates are given, and you must fill in the fixing code. Assistants are also provided so you can get help if you are trapped. But I give a B grade since you will have tremendous pressure by having zero mistakes in the homework so that you will not miss a lot of marks and get a poor grade since the mean is relatively high and the SD is relatively small. You also have to take a lot of past papers to get familiar with the exam mode.",

The first few topics were all fundamental, so if you didn't fully understand it, you wouldn't be able to understand the succeeding lessons. Most of the lessons after the midterm just build on your fundamental knowledge by making it more complex. <br /><br />There were 31 PowerPoint Presentation files (including introductory ones) and each PPT usually corresponds to one topic. <br /><br />There are both explanations and examples provided in the PPTs. They oversimplify many terms and make analogies to help better understand the topics (which is extremely helpful if you do not have any experience with programming, but it might seem too easy to those who have experience).<br /><br />However, the midterm and final exams are completely different from the labs and interactive examples. They are much longer and usually don't have much examples to refer to in the PPTs. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND doing pass papers AND the interactive examples to strengthen your knowledge and become comfortable with the exam format.<br /><br />Many questions can be overwhelming and complicated that require you to read long lines of code and try to critically interpret it without putting it into python.",

The lecture did help to supplement my learning but because most of the information about each topic are thoroughly explained in the PPTs, it's easy to learn on your own.<br /><br />Professor Li does a good job at teaching the course as it was made to be taught - as an introduction to computer science for those who have no background knowledge on it. She can be a bit repetitive sometimes, but they can also serve as important reminders for beginners. She rarely talks about things that are not included in the PPT and she entertains questions well. She is very responsive and easy to approach.",

They give you two options for course grading:<br /><br />1. Midterm 24%, Lab 36%, Final 40% <br />2.

            "comment_content": "It is all about Python 3.10 and aim to build up your programming mindset. From basic programming to the programming logic and the turtle drawings. It would be a great advantage if you have studied ICT (compulsory) or self-learnt any programming stuff before.<br /><br />I took Elective A (Database), instead of Elective D (Software Development), in my DSE ICT and got a 5* (in fact 0.5% to 5**) in 2022 but I didn't find this course tough to study.<br /><br />But please be noted that this course does not require you to have a programming background and it starts from zero. Therefore, I don't think that it is difficult to catch up if you have no ICT knowledge.<br /><br />However, I think that there is too much content about turtle drawings in python instead of real problem-solving algorithms. This is the only minus point I think about the content of this course.<br /><br />Overall content rate: A-",

Also, this course uses a lot of Turtle Graphics (a kind of GUI).<br /><br />This is not a difficult course if you have studied any programming language before, you just need to learn some syntax of Python. Even if you have never learnt any programming before, I still highly recommend you to study this course. You do not need to spend too much time to understand the code in the course. However, if you want to get a higher mark in this course, I suggest you to write some small program as practice each week to have a better understanding of the material taught in the course. You may also learn more about Python from other online material ( such as learnpython.org ) if you are really interested.<br /><br />[General Course Schedule]<br />Week 1:\tIntroduction to Python and Turtle Graphics<br />Week 2:\tIf, then, else &amp; Loops<br />Week 3:\tFor loops<br />Week 4:\tLists and Tuples<br />Week 5:\tFunctions <br />Week 6:\tStacks &amp; Slice Notation<br />Week 7:\tMidterm<br />Week 8:\tData Types Handling<br />Week 9:\tTurtle Window Events<br />Week 10: Dictionaries &amp; Timers &amp; Turtle Screen Event<br />Week 11:\tMore on Operators &amp; Colors &amp; File Handling<br />Week 12 &amp; 13: Object &amp; Recursion<br /><br />[Assignment 1 &amp; 2]<br />Assignment 1 is to write a program that create a &quot;L-system&quot;, while the second one is to create a Tetris Game.<br /><br />If you follow the lab material well, you can complete 80-90% of the assignment. The remaining parts need to be programmed on your own.<br /><br />[Midterm]<br />Midterm examination is a open book / open notes exam, but you cannot use a calculator during the exam. You can bring as much notes as you like, or even print out some code you wrote before. However, it does not help you much as the exam is mostly testing your logical thinking.<br /><br />The exam may have some tricky part, such as:<br />- Data type (ex: integer and floating point)<br />- Functions (ex: global variable and local variable)<br /><br />Therefore, be very careful when doing the midterm exam and try to avoid making any mistake. It is possible to attain full mark in the exam.<br /><br />[Online Assignment]<br />This part is a special arrangement for this semester. I believe the coming semesters will use the original arrangement.<br /><br />In the online assignment, there are more tricky questions than those in the midterm. For example, only part of the program is given and some content in the variable is hidden. However, you will have sufficient time to complete this assignment. You can try think of different case and run them on your computer. It is not that difficult if you can work with a computer rather than pen and paper only.",

            "comment_teaching": "rossiter speaks very vividly and passionately. However, the difficulty of the content of the class and the content of the exam are too different. The exam is very unfriendly to students who have no computer foundation at all. Since you made the exam questions so difficult, shouldn't the class be more difficult? In the end, I just had to study on my own for the final based on the questions from previous years.",
            "comment_grading": "This is the most sb part of the class. A fucking bunch of people have studied computers before. The result is a particularly bad grade given. Don't you fucking call a basic computer class supposed to be for students with no computer skills? This course is required for many non-SENG students. As a result, it's mixed with a bunch of students who have the basics and those who eventually want to major in computer science. How can we compare this class together when we all place different levels of importance on it? <br />It is difficult for non-SENG students or students with basic knowledge to do well in this course. And more importantly, the way the grade is given in this class is also very retarded. There are two ways to give grades, one counts as a midterm grade and one does not, but the final grade and the usual work will account for a much larger percentage. These two ways seem to give us more opportunities. But in reality, there is only one way to get a good grade. That is to get a high grade at the end of the period. To be clear the grade for this class is basically just the final. Even if your midterm and regular assignments are high, once you don't play well at the end of the semester your grade in this class is bound to suck. Because no matter how you do the math, the percentage at the end of the period is the largest. Also the grades in this class are too damn concentrated. A- and B- are less than ten points apart. Even if you can get a few points above MEAN, you can only get a B-. To put it bluntly, the grades given are really fucking outrageous.<br />Finally, students without basic knowledge are advised not to enroll in this course in the fall. There are too many students and seniors who have taken computer science. It is recommended to enroll in the spring and you should be better off.",
            "comment_workload": "It doesn't look very big. There are only a few times the lab has to be completed. But because the class lectures are too easy, you have to find a way to study on your own in order to cope with the exam. Do past topics or study python related videos online.

A competent primary school student will have no problem getting full marks in all assignments and exams.<br /><br />Typing skills and reading speed will be of great importance since you're unable to copy some of the code from exams, but you're allowed to type them out and run them. It's kind of a reasonable setting but also kind of retarded in the way it gives advantage to students with good typing skills. I guess there are two rationales behind. The first reason is that if you can type with fast speed, you will be more or less experienced in coding. The second is that they want the exam to mimic actual programming setting instead of bland written exam. But to be honest, it's not that difficult to include more problems where typing out the entire code will not suffice for getting the correct answer.",

However, I fucked up a lot and got a really bad score.<br /><br />Finals:<br />Objectively easy. I made some careless mistakes too.<br /><br />The exams in this course are very similar to the SAT. You are given questions that test your logic in a very short amount of time. <br /><br />If you don't understand the code given to you in the question then you could just type it out in Python and run it (requires fast typing though).",

It is a very fun course if you ask me. everything except recursion part is very easy, I would say if you learnt programming before, you would have absolutely no trouble keeping up. <br />If you are quite good at programming, that's not much new thing you could learn though. this is just an intro course, so do not except many new things.",

However, in my personal view, if you got some programming background (programming courses or experience before entering university), you could just skip the lectures. I don't think it is necessary to attend lectures, and there is also no attendance too.

Since they are offering around 1200 vacancies for students to enrol the class, it makes the exam difficult to organize. In the mid-term, the course website just went down before the exam and they delayed the exam for 30 minutes. The Final Exam was another case.

All you need to do is just a kind of fill-in-the-blank job. So the average score for three labs are all above 95%. I think you will get a100% for your work unless you skipped, because there's no way for you to get score reducted.<br /><br />The mid-term is just as easy as the lab, testing only the most basic logic. Stats is shown as below:<br />Average\t64.4%<br />Standard deviation\t21.5%<br />Maximum\t100%<br />Minimum (excluding zeros)\t2.5%<br />TBH, cant imagine how to get below 80 in the exam... I got 91, which surprised me because I was expecting a 95+.<br /><br />Final is hard, massive work required in a short time. Stats is as below:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average ~55.9%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard deviation ~20.5%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum 100.0%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum ~8.6%<br />Really confusing because the average seems to be similar as mid-term.

The competition is extremely high in this course, so you have no right to make mistakes. There are also 2 grading schemes because some students (me including) have never experienced tests in programming world and can perform not satisfying their plans. You know, asians can do well without understanding much because they have tests in their DNA. That's why having 2 grading schemes is a good idea.<br /><br />My results:<br />Labs - 100/100 (Avg: 92)<br />Midterm - 60/100 (Avg: 62)<br />Final: 79/100(Avg: 70)<br />Second grading scheme -&gt; 87.8% overall B+",

Start a long time before the exams and it will help you a lot! Many students will look only on 10% of them. You can be better!",
