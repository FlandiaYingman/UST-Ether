Not a business student so cannot say much about whether the contents would still be used in the real world today, but they are inspiring to some extent.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor QIU Xuan has really good Engligh accent. She also raise questions in class so there is good interaction.<br /><br />As i said the professor might assume that the content is easy enough to understand, and without any business background I felt lost from time to time. For this course the most important thing is to really understand all the concepts and make quick reaction to calculations. The calculation stuffs are really based on intuition instead of math, so if you don't understand all those formula i suggest you treat them as application problems in your middle school math.(like what you would see in Inventory Management)",
            "comment_grading": "10% Homework<br />5% participation (in class polling)<br />20% project<br />30% midterm<br />35% final exam<br /><br />The grading was not thaaat good as some of the previous reviews said, but it is not as competitive as other reviews said either. Only being eligible to view some of the reviews at the beginning of the semester, I thought this course is the somewhat light-hearted, blow-water and everyone can get good grade very easily (You see, people on USTSPACE can't always be reliable! Many of them write review simply because they got A+ and might simply want to show off a bit). With this mindset i chose the class and clearly I ended up wrong. It might be because i have no business background at all so sometimes i felt really lost in the class and it was really painful. So if you simply want to improve your CGA, go to CHEM1004, where you may get even better result with same effort. (just personal opinion lol)<br />I got about 1sd above mean in the midterm and only 71/100 in the final. FINE i have no idea why i lost so many marks in final, and there was time i thought i would end up B range. I still secure a marginal A range in the end though. Still somewhat lenient.",
            "comment_workload": "Relatively low, as I hardly spend time dealing with the course material. I did take serious review before the midterm so i can say that i master some of the contents like Forecasting. but I skipped or slept over some of the classes in the final season because i couldn't keep up or i was busy with other courses. For concepts i didn't know i simply took a glimps and enhanced the understanding only days before final exam. I wasn't taking the course too serously so my grade seems matching.<br />Homework works well with excel, but never be depedent on it, as you are required to do everything by hand in exams after all.<br />For concepts you don't understand, try to watch recording or ask TA in the tutorial and treat in-class exercise seriously.",

The project is due towards the end of the semester where everyone is quite busy though.<br /><br />Project guidelines:<br />Start up a small business which makes and sells food in HKUST campus.<br />Specifically, your group has to:<br />o Develop your competitive strategy;<br />o Design your products;<br />o Conduct demand forecasting of your products;<br />o Develop inventory management policy (and/or MRP)<br />Other issues can be also considered, e.g. analyze the location, determine product price, estimate revenue and operating costs, and project annual financial return from your investment.<br /><br />Project was interesting but in my opinion, most groups are doing the same things, so I expect it is probably quite hard to differentiate yourself through the project.",

It is highly recommended for both Business and Engineering students who have difficulties enrolling in a proper S&amp;T CC course. Business students should find the course easy, just because the course is very similar to another business course, ISOM 2700 OM, covering similar content. <br />Civil Engineering students should find some chapters are easy, since some contents are covered in CIVL 2160 &amp; 2170.<br />____________________________________________________<br />Course Detail: (Calculations with asterisks*)<br /><br />Midterm: <br />1. Introduction to Operation Management <br />2. Product and Service Design <br />3. *Project Management* (CPM/PERT/Activity Crashing)<br />4. *Process and Facility Layout* (Line Balancing , GPW/GNFT, efficiency,idle time, min. workstations etc.)<br />5. Quality Management <br />6. *Demand Forecasting* (MAD, MAPE, MSE, Linear Regression, Naive Method, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Holt' Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters Method) <br />____________________________________________________<br />Final <br />7. *Location Planning and Analysis* (Single Facility Allocation Model)<br />8.*Inventory Management* (EOQ, EPQ Model, Reorder point, Quantity Discount Model, Newsvendor Model, critical ratio, Safety stock, Continuous review policy QR Model etc.)<br />9.*Aggregate Planning* (Level, Chase, Mixed strategies, MPS)<br />10.*MRP and JIT* (MRP and MPS) <br />____________________________________________________<br />The course covers quite a lot calculations, but once you understand well how them work in different scenarios and the procedures, you will be very fine with the aid of cheat-sheet during exams.",
            "comment_teaching": "This is a IE and CC(S&amp;T) course, with both lecture and tutorial included. <br /><br />Dr. Qiu is a young (about 30) and responsible lecturer from Mainland. Unlike most Mainland professors in UST, she doesn't have strong and typical accent, which facilitates her to deliver the lecture content clearly to students from diverse background. <br /><br />She is able to point out the lecture content with adequate interactions. However, personally speaking, I think students should pay much attention when she is going to cover the calculations of different models, which are demanding and quite hard to understand completely in first sense. Please joint down the calculation procedures and logic from the whiteboard displayed in the classroom, which are helpful for further revision and completing the assignments.Sometimes she gives additional examples which are not included in the lecture notes, better copy them and take photos. For other course content without involving calculations, you can just listen and figure out the key points from the lecture notes, which are essential for preparing the MC questions in both exams. <br /><br />For the tutorials, we have 4 tutorials this semester. Flora Chang, the TA, is very helpful. She provides more additional examples for&nbsp;&nbsp;the calculation problems in different topics, pointing out the techniques and procedures involved, as a supplement to the lectures. <br /><br />Just feel free to raise questions to both lecturer and TA, they are willing to answer and give additional explanations.",

Exams are not really difficult, but you better be careful with the calculations with clumsy steps. If you are able to do the calculations well and have great cheat-sheet for the MC questions, everything is very fine. <br /><br />Paper-Setting:<br />15 MC questions (30%)<br />3-5 Calculation Problems (70%)<br /><br />My Result:<br />Assignments nearly full mark <br />Pop Quizzes full mark<br />Group project (result not released,should be above mean)<br />Mid Term 82/100 (mean=71,above around 1 SD)<br />Final (result not released, should be above mean since final is more challenging) <br /><br />Personal Grade: A- <br />Turns out the grade is reasonable if you work hard for this course and probably an A is possible if performance of mid-term is exceptionally high.",

Otherwise, you may find it hard to work on the project as they may not perform as you expect. <br />As the project topic is easy, people propose similar ideas. If you want a good grade, make sure you go into details in the project with clear calculations. You may also work harder on the PowerPoint as some other groups have poor presentation slides.",

So after her teaching, we can have deepen understanding of the formula. So I don't feel that I have some confusion on solving the problems. Her lecture is useful than tutorial class.<br />I was also taking ISOM 2700 in this semester, I feel that if I have some concepts I cannot understand in ISOM 2700, I could totally understand by her teaching. SO GOOD!<br />However, there is one problem: Her speed is toooooo fast!!! sometimes she just finish her 1.5 hr lecture in 1 hour. We calculate that she almost finished one slide in 20 sec hahahaha.

She did it randomly, you won't know when you should do. But the quiz is super easy, you can finish it in 10 minutes and get full marks.<br />There are only three homework in this semester. The homework is easy because she have calculation steps and example questions in the ppt. Also, if you have source, you will not have problems on that. The mean is high, always 97/100.<br />The midterm is not so difficult. You have cheat sheet but seems useless. The formula is useful but you don't know how to prepare for the mc questions about concepts. I did well in long questions but always lose marks in mc. So what you can do is not just make a good cheat sheet, but you should also understand the concepts.<br />The final is not so easy wor, because the time is limit but the long questions need many steps. So I feel that I don't have enough time to finish it well.<br />The project is not difficult, because you don't need to do some survey or other things, what you should do is to use her formula and analysis your business. It is called 紙上談兵.<br />MY RESULT: My class participation is full mark. My homework results are 97/100, 100/100 and 100/100, the means are all 97/100. My midterm is 89/100, the mean is around 76 and sd is around 13, I forget hahaha, but I know I don't beyond one sd. I don't know my project and final result. Finally I get A. SO GOOD !!!!1",
