            "comment_content": "The content covers the introductory components of thermodynamics for chemical and biological engineers. Altogether, there are 19 lectures. The first half of the course is relatively easier than the second half for sure.",
            "comment_teaching": "Henry Lam's teaching is legendary. I have not ever, in my entire 20 years of life, met a teacher as conscientious and committed to teaching his students as him. He selects really helpful TAs to assist him, but I honestly preferred just asking him my questions directly. To be honest, I think if I sent him an email at 11:45pm, he would reply by 11:30pm the same day. He is extremely helpful to his students and only wants to watch you succeed. The course is a huge struggle for most people and he is really understanding about that - near the time for homework submission, he actually reveals what the answers are and gives hints on how to solve it.",
            "comment_grading": "Professor Lam (or Henry) is known for grading really nicely. Despite the fact your scores after the midterm and final may make you feel that you have for sure failed/barely passed, when he releases the final results, most people are very pleasantly surprised (I know I was). I believe this is for two reasons, mainly: <br /><br />1. I don't think he curves his grading at a C, which many UST courses do. Obviously, I cannot say for sure though. <br /><br />2. The percentage breakdowns for the midterm, final, homeworks, participation, quizzes etc. are quite good, in my opinion. For this online semester at least, the grading breakdown was as follows: <br /><br />Class participation: 5%<br />In-class quizzes: 10% (your worst 3 grades will be dropped)<br />Homework: 25%<br />Midterm: 30%<br />Final: 30% <br /><br />My advice is, if you are a student who finds it difficult to do well under exam pressure, put your efforts into doing well in the homework for sure. It will come a long way to ensure at least a decent grade, even if you don't do very well for your exams! <br /><br />Note that his courses are notoriously known for low means too! If I remember correctly, the means for the final and midterm were in the 29-45 range out of 100. Be mindful of this.",
            "comment_workload": "The only negative thing I have to say about this course is the workload. This course uses the 'flipped classroom' mode of learning. In short, you watch pre-made lecture videos by hime on each topic, then you show up to class/Zoom to ask hime questions and then you will take a quiz. Due to this, you can expect to spend a considerable few hours a week on this course, because not only do you have to watch the video at least 2x a week, you will also have homeworks to do, and exams to prepare for. Additionally, there is a quiz nearly every lesson (save for 2 instances, we had a quiz every lesson). It is only 3 questions, but these questions can be extremely hard. You will have 5-7 minutes per quiz. This can be an additional source of annoyance, especially during busy midterm/final periods where the last thing you want to think about is how you forgot to watch the video, and now you are being quizzed on it. <br /><br />The homework in this course is difficult, but doable. He has a very high level of expectation in terms of presentation and understanding - it is NOT enough to have the answers written down and submitted. You have to do a full write up, which include system diagrams, assumptions made, which equations and why, and explain your steps in working out the answer. If you aren't naturally detail-oriented, this will be the course that changes how you do write-ups for the rest of your life. I highly recommend checking in with your TAs/Henry himself that your understanding is correct. Even a small mistake WILL be caught and marks will be deducted. <br /><br />BUT despite the homework being a bit of a pain, he often uses concepts from the homework in his exams. If you thoroughly understand the homework, you have a better chance of not being confused in the exam. This isn't always guaranteed, but it's worth knowing.",

But Henry will be there to assist you. <br />Basically thermodynamics, thee are 20 chapters, I am not going to list them here but I could give you a brief idea: <br />1. System definitions (open vs closed system) and reversibility<br />2. First law and second law of thermodynamics for closed system <br />3. First law and second law of thermodynamics for open system <br />4. Second law and isentropic efficiency <br />5. Maxwell's equations and partial derivative manipulation (he will provide notes and guidelines on those manipulations <br />6. PVT correlations for real gases <br />7. Property relations <br />8. Liquids' properties <br />9. Phase behaviour of pure substances <br />10. Mixtures, chemical potential and residual properties, excess properties <br />11. Fugacities (quite challenging)<br />12. Phase Equilibria, Henry's law, flash calculations, Roult's Law <br />13. Chemical Equilibrium, standard Gibb's free energy<br />14. Equilibrium constant, heterogenous reactions",
            "comment_teaching": "So far the best professor I have seen in my university life. He adopts a flipped classroom etaching method where he would publish lecture videos on canvas and let us discuss homework questions in class, of course he would include quizzes in class to make sure we understand the concepts<br />I honestly think this is better than conventional teaching because it allows peer interaction and exchange of ideas between students and it's a great chance to meet friends too <br />Henry provides a lot of help during class and he always give the answers before homework submission, but how you arrive to the answer is the main thing actually<br />He provides a lot of consultation sessions for students to raise questions before exams and tests, which I appreciate a lot!!! <br />He replies to email enquiries instantly!!!! <br />The course material is made difficult deliberately, it has approx the same level of difficulty as those studying thermo in MIT/Stanford so don't feel discouraged",
            "comment_grading": "I expected a low grade because I was never good at math and physics but I got an A- so I guess the grading system is pretty nice. Much thanks to Henry's kindness and supportive groupmates in class.",
            "comment_workload": "It's acceptable. Not too low nor too high. The homework questions are very difficult and could take you 4-5 hours to finish them but as I said, Henry, along with other TAs who are very nice too, will guide you through. You need to work hard enough and do as many past-papers to ace the final and mid-term.",

The thing is there are also quizes in the video, and the content is actually very hard, so some times you might need to spend up to two hours for the videos before each class. You really have to spare effort going through these videos because at the first five minutes of each 9am lecture, we have a graded quiz related to the video that would be counted into our final grade. <br />Besides that, we have to solve hard questions and present them in a fancy typed file, in which the formating also would be graded.",
