There are separate readings for class and tutorials. <br /><br />The content was unclear and the TA was unresponsive to my emails, so I was left to google most things.",
            "comment_teaching": "While he is very passionate about anthropology, he teaching is very slow and unclear. <br /><br />He will provide paper copies of the slides but his slides mainly contain pictures. <br /><br />He doesn't usually reference the readings in class, so you are left to read them on your own.<br /><br />He rarely uses canvas for grading, so be ready to submit projects through email and praying he got it.",

He also seemed to have a lot of problems with my project topic. I ended up with B+",

It has to be 3000 words and you will have to conduct fieldwork. <br /><br />There are two quizzes during the sem based on readings. YOU WILL HAVE TO READ 7-10 READINGS FOR EACH QUIZ. <br /><br />Tutorials are compulsory and there will be attendance taken. Participation is tutorials is also necessary. Groups of 4 will be formed in tutorials and you will have to present any 1 tutorial reading. <br /><br />You lose points for missing tutorials.",
