If you found it interesting in the first several lectures then you will love to learn more about law. Most of the law were illustrated with cases and they are very interesting. The Ordinances were taught with cases so there were a lot of printed material as well.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. PONG is very talented and I can see his passion for teaching. He came to teach in UST after his work and sometimes he didn't even have dinner. He is also very caring and willing to answer students' questions.<br />However, there was not much chance to have him as our lecturer since he was sometimes busy and he found somebody works in EPD to give the lecture. <br />Tbh, I enjoy Prof. PONG's lecture more than the others.",
            "comment_grading": "Not sure about others but I got a relatively good grade. Prof. PONG is very generous in giving out bonus points when you are brave enough to answer his question during classes. No need to worry whether it is right or wrong, just revise a bit before each class and give the answer when he asks questions.<br />No attendance but you should go to the class to enjoy and learn (Wednesday 7-10pm)",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is ok for me. Only one assignment and one presentation. Due to the situation in Hong Kong, the presentation and the final exam was canceled. Instead, we submitted a group work of a list of questions and a case.",

The content itself is very relevant to environmental ordinances in Hong Kong and uses case studies to demonstrate how they would apply in the real-world. He also gave us the opportunity to do a court visit to sit in real trials. The content was hard to grasp at first, such as the basics of law AND Hong Kong environmental ordinances. But once you get over the learning curve, you will find that the course is super interesting and relevant",
