            "comment_teaching": "The professor is good at teaching, however he can be a little spacey at times. He may get lost and can be a little confusing, but is always open to questions and will repeat something if you don't understand. He is very kind, however, he can be a little boring at times. I found his teaching quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, this class was held virtually, so there was not a lot of interaction between the professor and the students.<br /><br />He goes over a lot of research papers while he is teaching, so make sure to pay attention to the diagrams and explanations he spends most of his time on.",
            "comment_grading": "The course is absolute grading, which is great.<br /><br />A range - 85+ (don't know the rest sorry)<br /><br />both exams were open-book, open internet, so he made the questions slightly harder.<br />The midterm exam was significantly easier than the final, probably because there were fewer application questions and more memorizing questions. The final had more application questions, which is why I probably didn't do so well.",
