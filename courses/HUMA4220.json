        "description": "The West's cognizance of Chinese people and society has been informed by mixed sentiments of idealism, ignorance, and fear, giving rise to a fragmented vision of China as what it always was: exotic, fascinating, potentially dangerous, and practically misconceived. This course covers a wide range of critical and imaginative texts including language manuals, linguistic translations, intellectual treatises, missionary records, travelogues, creative writings, visual performance and entertainments to examine how verbal and audiovisual representations have shaped the Western conception of China through history.",

Students are required to talk frequently in order to excel in this course.<br />Remember, the film might not be finished in the lecture, so you need to finish it yourself.",
