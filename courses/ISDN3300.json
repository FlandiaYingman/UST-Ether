        "description": "Interaction Design is a design practice to enhance the interaction between users and design solutions. This course stresses user interaction with technology‚Äêbased products, services or systems. It also studies the broader interactions beyond merely interaction between users with computer platforms. Students will be introduced several forms of interaction design and their core design principles and tools improving user interaction. They include, Interaction Design (IxD) studying how to form a structure for users to act and react to the products, services or systems; User Experience Design (UX) exploring how to enhance a positive feeling for users while interacting; User Interface Design (UI) enhancing the experience through better design of the interface elements. Finally, the course will consider broader aspects of Interaction Design, including interfacing the workflow with other teams, privacy, and dark patterns. Students will design an interactive application from the initial ideation to usability testing.",
