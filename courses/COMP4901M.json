        "description": "This course critically surveys the fast moving, urgent, emerging area of AI ethics. AI is explosively disrupting every sphere of our work and lives. Cambridge Analytica and fake news bots. AI driven social media displacing traditional journalism. Drone warfare. Elimination of traditional jobs. Privacy-violating advertising. Biased AI decision/recognition algorithms. Deepfakes. Autonomous vehicles. Automated hedge fund trading. No area remains untouched. Policy think tanks, governments, and tech companies around the world have started paying serious attention to AI ethics. How will human civilization survive the rise of AI? What are the new rules? What are the ethical frameworks needed to avoid extinction? What are engineers’ and entrepreneurs’ ethical responsibilities?",
