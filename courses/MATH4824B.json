It will use some of the following practical problems such as text classification, information extraction, sequence modeling, text inference, QA system, etc. as illustrations to demonstrate the power of the statistical learning algorithms.",

Need to fine tune the parameters to get a relatively high validation accuracy in order to get a high mark in the model part<br /><br />Final Exam, 2 hours and 40 minutes online exam. Format is similar to the sample final question he gave us. Should get high marks if you have done the sample final and understand the concepts well.<br /><br />Overall workload is not too high",
