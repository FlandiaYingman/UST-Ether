        "description": "This course approaches Chinese women as both historical and fictional figures to unravel the complicated relationship between history and visual representation. Each week revolves around a special topic and a film about Chinese women located in a specific socio-historical period. This course is in chronological order, beginning from Republican women to contemporary female immigrants in the age of globalization. The changing images of women on screen went hand in hand with major cinematic movements in history, including the left turn in the 1930s, the rise of animation, socialist filmmaking, model opera film, underground/independent filmmaking, and the cinematic globalization. The purpose of this course is to build a foundation for students from different academic backgrounds who may have little or no knowledge of Chinese culture and history. Proficiency in Chinese is a plus but not required because all reading materials and class discussion are in English.",

I think this course is the most enjoyable course I have taken in university life.",
            "comment_teaching": "Each lecture focuses on the analysis of one movie. You have to watch the assigned movie and read the assigned materials before attending the lecture <br /><br />The ppt has little content. In order to understand the technical terms of filmmaking, you should pay attention to the lecture and most importantly the classroom discussion. Otherwise, you will get lost. <br /><br />The lecture is mainly the classroom discussion. Professor will ask many questions and invite students to share their views. Each discussion topic spends at least 15 to 20 minus. There is no right and wrong answer so as long as you are willing to speak up, you can get the participation mark. <br /><br />The lecture takes 3 hours long and you have to pay attention to the professor's questions during 3 hours and grab any opportunities to answer the questions in order to get a full participation mark. Students are very competitive so you should stay focused. It is quite stressful and exhausting after this 3-hour lecture. But I think you can get a full participation mark if you can speak at least 3 times each lecture.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading Criteria:<br />• Attendance: 10% or F<br />Being 5 minutes late for class three times will be counted as one unexcused absence. Four or more unexcused absences will automatically lower your final grade to F.<br /><br />• Participation: 10%<br />Better to speak at least three times per lecture. But sometimes it is hard to get the chance to speak because students are very competitive ... so you have to grab every chance to speak! <br /><br />• Weekly quiz: 5%<br />The quiz is super easy. Only one question. No worries about the quiz. The purpose of the quiz is to force you to watch the film before class. As long as you know the story of the film, you can get a full mark. <br /><br />• Mid-term paper (1000 words): 25%<br />The marking is quite lenient for the Mid-term paper. As long as you follow the instruction, you can get a good grade. <br /><br />• A film analysis (500 words): 5%<br />It is very easy. Just analyze a film. <br /><br />• Final paper (1000 words): 45%<br />The marking is much stricter than the mid-term paper. But I think as long as you fulfil the requirements, you can get a good grade easily. <br /><br />The grade is very good!!! I got A+",

Just watch the film and you will know how to answer the question) <br />• Mid-term and final papers<br />(Better to start working on the papers earlier but the paper is not difficult to handle)",

Every lesson, students have to watch one movie in the lecture. It's fun to watch them in the lectures.<br /><br />Every lecture, Professor will give a pop up quiz (sometimes) which is really easy as it focus on the the movies that we have watch in the previous week. And the&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor will ask questions and discuss with the students about the reading and movies. After that Professor will teach the background of that movies, the directors, the actors...Then we have a break and start to watch another movies!<br /><br />And, as the movies are quite old, some movies shown in the lectures do not have English subtitles, so for foreign students, they have to borrow the CDs from the library which have English subtitles.
