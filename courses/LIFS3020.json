            "comment_content": "Topics were similar to those learnt from cell bio (LIFS2040) and biochem II but in much greater detail, and there are so many mechanisms and details, and a lot of the topics interconnect - it all came about to be very messy, especially for me! <br /><br />The main topics were:<br />Pingbo <br />1. Signalling and cell communication (5-6 lectures) - very complicated pathways, and he includes so many examples. <br />2. Cell matrix and extracellular matrix (2.5 lectures) - I honestly did not understand much here, he listed out so many examples, very hard to follow, didn't flow well for me at all. Overall students were left confused with this. <br />[Mid-terms - 35%] <br /><br />3. Cell Differentiation and stem cells (3 lectures) - Easiest part of the course. This is the only part where the exam question was very direct and easy. <br /><br />Randy: <br />4. Cell Cycle and control (8-9 lectures) - Started off easy, when it got to the 4-5 lecture it just skyrocketed, just saying, he drew an overall pathway summary of the entire thing and 3 boards was NOT enough. PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO THIS PART. <br /><br />5. Apoptosis (2.5 lectures) - pretty straightforward <br />6. Telomeres (1.5 lectures) - pretty easy, not much content to it. <br /><br />Randy talks about a lot of experimental approaches, do take notes and do further research on those cuz it will really help for the finals. <br /><br />(LIFS2010 would really help with Randy's part, he actually continued on where LIFS2010 left off, would advice you do that course first) <br /><br />This course is an open-book exam course, which actually makes it worse - the questions can be so indirect or so random and they would expect you to answer. <br /><br />Mid-term exams (35%) <br />- 5 Questions with part a), b) c) d) ...., all require either short sentences or paragraphs, some were essays <br />- The last question had a reading comprehension about this weird signalling pathway, and you had to draw the entire mechanism and draw out implications and disprove it (exactly, wtf??). <br />- A lot of the previous questions require identification of a certain protein X for example, which requires you to flip through over 50 pages of lecture material (including over 100 proteins) to find which one it is. <br />- They were also experimental based - students were doing this experiment and something happened, explain using mechanisms studied .... a lot are not even directly related so&nbsp;&nbsp;it was very confusing. <br /><br />Final exams (65%)<br />- 15% is on cell differentiation, Pingbo's part was surprisingly easy, he asked something about pathways to differentiation, clinical choices of stem cells therapy involving a twin, and a discussion of two students opinions of cell differentiation and you have to talk about what is correct, and who you agree with more... <br /><br />- 25% of Randy's part is a complicated question, basically an experiment of cell cycle with a bunch of drug treatments (e.g. Drug A, B, C ... G) and you have the raw data of flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and whether cell division is occuring. Basically there is a list of questions that are like &quot;one drug is known to prevent phosphorylation of ...., deduce which drug is this&quot; or like 'suggest an additional experimental technique to confirm this hypothesis that drug C does this ...&quot;. It would really help if you organize your notes here, so many ppl were flipping around and got confused. <br />Whats so funny is that this question, if done properly, actually makes you come to realization that everything in this cell cycle is actually connected together in some weird way, which was not obvious when learning it in class. <br /><br />- 25% Randy's part - Essay question. He has given about 5 choices of an essay title, and they are all 'common theme' questions - basically he provides a general cell biological concept and asks you to use examples from the topics studied to elaborate. <br /><br />For example, the question I choose was something along the lines of 'Positive feedback plays an important role in cell bio ..., using examples from the topics studied, talk about the implications of positive feedback ...' <br /><br />The key here is to do an intro paragraph about what it is and its role in cell biology, and do 2-3 body paragraphs of examples and their further implications (for example, positive feedback allows for amplification, cell memory, switch like effect ...) and conclusion paragraph to summarise. <br /><br />I can remember 2 of the other questions, they were something like -<br />- The important of localisation in cell biology <br />- Viral infections and their effects on cellular pathways <br /><br />the other 2 seems complicated (like evaluate a quote or smth) which nobody I know did.",
            "comment_teaching": "Both professors had a very similar teaching style - they went through the ppts like they are following through with a very long story, where you have to understand one part before moving onto the next. They both also use the board a lot to make cute drawings to demonstrate their point, or come up with tricky scenarios for students to try and explain. <br /><br />Pingbo style is more in a list form - for example, there are 4 main kinds of signalling pathways, and the first kind and 5 different types, and the first type has 2 different scenarios .... he likes to describe each thing in a list of a list and move through them. He also really liked class participation, when he asks a challenging question and nobody answers he would start to bring out the class list to intimidate us, but luckily each time the someone in the front said something! <br /><br />Randy's parts follow through his part in order of the journals, for example in cell cycle he would start with early research on yeast, and work through till current research of cancer. And the pathway elucidation and mechanism follows through like a very long story. He introduces a lot of experimental techniques on the way to explain these findings too. <br /><br />Pingbo also sent the class 3 sets of assignments (non-graded), which he will mark and give comments. Some were very deep biology philosophical questions which I couldn't even answer using his lecture slides and the internet (it was that hard). His mid-term exam was just equally as confusing. While Randy didn't provide any practice questions whatsoever, he told us to focus on the pathways only. <br /><br />Pingbo's part was lecture recorded (which really helps cuz a lot of it doesn't make sense in only one listen), Randy's part is not lecture recorded - attending his classes really makes a difference in the final exams.",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm - 35% (Mean was 48%) <br />Finals - 65% (Our scores and mean not revealed) <br /><br />Both professors have equal weighing of 50% (15% of finals is Pingo's part).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I actually failed the mid-term badly, I did not understand much of the content for the mid-term, was really confused during the exam and left most of it blank. <br /><br />Content wise, the finals was easier to understand and apply knowledge from lecture notes, I think I did decent in the finals. For some reason ended up with a B+ ? I know some people who got more than double my score in the mid term, and did okay in the finals who got the same grade? it is also said that not many students get within the A range of this course. <br /><br />There is no paper checking or even score release for final exams, a grade suddenly appeared one day.",
            "comment_workload": "Overall the content for this course is the heaviest I have ever seen for any LIFS course. You really need to make an effort to understand and research on these concepts. <br /><br />As the exams are open-book and the content is really confusing, you may have to do further research on some of the concepts, and ORGANIZE YOUR NOTES PROPERLY - most people cannot finish on time because they spend half the time flipping through trying to find the relevant sections.",

The midterm covers the first two parts while the cell differentiation part is left to the final with Randy's part.<br />I didn't take LIFS3010 in fall and took this course directly, and it turned out to be manageable and the order of taking these two courses is not important.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. HUANG's slides look the same as the textbook, while the order of some parts may be changed, and some figures may exist only in his edition of textbook. I personally didn't like his teaching that much, coz he is like talking through everything with no obvious emphasis, explaining not very clearly, and he spoke a little bit slowly. But good things about his teaching are that he sometimes made jokes to let students stay awake, and he gives out several exercise questions for each chapter to let us have a brief idea about what kind of questions would appear in the exam. He also marked the exercises himself and gave feedback. (BTW he seems to be a big fan of ChatGPT as he was keen on using it to produce standard answers)<br />As for Randy, he is the best professor that I have encountered so far in my point of view. He is definitely an expert in the field of cancer, and his demeanor gives off a sense of researchers(?). Different from prof. HUANG, his teaching had a strong emphasis on research methodology and the story of discovery, which may actually be more important than memorizing facts for those who want to do research in the future. His slides are well organized with different parts labeled differently, so that you can follow through more easily. (e.g. there are subheadings like &quot;overview&quot;, &quot;summary&quot;, and sidebars like &quot;experimental approached&quot;) In my opinion he explained things quite clearly, and his British humor and good English made the lecture more enjoyable.",
            "comment_grading": "Midterm: part of prof. HUANG's contents, 35%<br />Average 66.7, Std 17.7, Highest 99, me 96/100<br />Final: cell differentiation and Randy's parts, 65%<br />Both exams are open book with paper notes allowed. Final grades are not released. I got A+ in the end.<br />For midterm, there are short questions only, and they tested your understanding of important concepts like localization, signal amplification in cell signaling, and cell adhesion in the migration of cells etc. I think it would be fine as long as you understand the contents and bring your notes...? It is very straightforward compared to the final exam from Randy.<br />For final, prof. HUANG's part is similar, with short questions about the application of stem cell therapy, the exceptional case of &quot;genomic equivalence&quot; etc. I would suggest not to skip some pages of slides when printing the exam notes as they could happen to appear in the exam... Randy's part contains the analysis of a huge experiment on cell cycle &amp; checkpoints &amp; apoptosis and an essay. The experiment contains questions focusing on interpreting the result, how the knowledge you learnt in class can be used to explain them, retrodict experimental setup, and designing experiments to examine further hypothesis. Although I didn't figure it out completely, the question was really interesting to work on and effectively combine almost everything covered by Randy. The essay occupies half of the 50 marks from Randy, and there are five topics to choose from. The previous review actually gave a great hint on the topics, and I thought about what to write about positive feedback beforehand. I would say the other topics are not that abstract, but the positive feedback seems to be the most popular. I also followed the advice from previous review on organization of the essay, and it is really helpful. (Beginning -- examples and explanation -- conclusion and extension) Thank you so much! Generally speaking, the topic of the essay is mostly about extracting common theme and methodologies from the contents covered in class. <br />3hrs is not very short for the final exam, but you definitely need to manage your time well and save enough time for the essay even though you find the experiment questions very confusing and couldn't stop thinking about it.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say the workload is high if you want to really learn something and get good grades... Attending lectures (especially Randy's) help with you getting familiar with the contents, and I recommend reading some part of the textbook for prof. HUANG's part if the logic flow was not clear. I didn't check textbook for Randy's part as I think his part is already quite systematic. You need to pay attention and jot down notes in Randy's lectures when he is explaining the experimental approaches as he sometimes draws an experimental setting on the whiteboard for students to analyze, and I think they are quite helpful for the final exam. <br />I recommend making your own summaries and mindmaps for both professors' parts before exams as this really help you sort things out and see the relationships of different parts better as the contents are quite overwhelming from the first glance.",

The people I know who had similar scores to me in MT all have lower final grades than me.<br /><br />For the final, I found a past paper on Course Hero.<br /><br />For Pingbo's part there were three questions. Two questions were exactly the same and one was very similar in concepts. I just prepared answers for each question based on the course notes and ChatGPT.<br /><br />For Randy, there were two parts. Part I was based on an experimental setup. This part was set up similarly to the past paper, but entirely different proteins were involved. It focused a lot more on apoptotic proteins than the past paper I think.<br /><br />For the essay section, I prepared for the topics that the previous commenter mentioned as well as the ones in the past paper. A lot of them were not fully the same, but similar enough. I used one of my prepared essays and just added more details based on what the prompt required / shifted the focus a bit.<br /><br />I did Pingbo's part first, then the essay, and just spent the rest of the time on the experimental questions.",
            "comment_workload": "Personally, I did not find this to be a very high workload course, mainly because there is only midterm and final.<br /><br />As mentioned I didn't attend lectures after add/drop and did not study for the midterm beyond reading Pingbo's notes once.<br /><br />I studied for the final exam for maybe 5 days, mostly focusing on summarizing Randy's slides and pre-drafting some possible essays based on the past paper.<br /><br />If you actually attend the lectures or review materials as you go, your workload will probably be even lower.",
