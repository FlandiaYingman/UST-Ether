            "comment_content": "This course will teach students to learn more about STEAM skills, especially for underwater robots. For example, we will try to understand the basics of buoyancy, Newton's law, and investigate the structures of the underwater robots. In our course, we often abbreviate underwater robots as UWR, just in case you come accross this short form.<br /><br />You will also learn from various NGO on how to communicate with Special Education Needs (SEN students), in which you have to be patient and repeat the keywords with certain amount of facial and body gesture to deliver the messages clearly to them.",
            "comment_teaching": "The support from the tutors and professors, as well as from NGO is excellent. Very easy to understand, clear powerpoints are made. You can also make a Whatsapp group, WeChat group, Discord or Skype to chat with your teammates on your findings.",
            "comment_grading": "It is a very good grade course, basically if you attend the classes on time (since it requires us to take screenshots on zoom)<br />You also have to prepare the teaching materials.<br />If all these works have proper inputs, then your effort will pay off",

No extra reading materials<br />Just some presentations, projects and attendance takings",
