            "comment_content": "The first half of the course focus on fish culture, basically everything about how to culture different kinds of fish: salmon, groupers, carps, etc. Even cover topic about fish feeds. But nothing related to genetic manipulative whatsoever.<br /><br />The second half of the course is slightly more relevant. Talking about fish diseases control, nutrients, reproduction control. Finally there is one single powerpoint about genetic manipulation. Extremely disappointing and irrelevant materials. It seems that the course is very confused about what kind of content it should cover.",
            "comment_teaching": "I have never seen any professor so lost and confused in his own lessons. During the lectures, he would be late for 10mins every time, then spend another 5mins searching for his powerpoint. In the middle of explanation, he would stutter a lot and eventually lose track of what he wants to say. He apparently did not pay any effort into preparing for lessons since he will constantly derail from the lecture materials and talk about random stuff. <br /><br />In a nutshell, I have no idea what he's doing. And neither does he.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is normal. Mean should be around B or B-, Mid term= 25 MC(closed book), Finals= MC+ 3 long questions(open book)<br /><br />However, the examination is a complete mess. Joseph would distribute a 25 MC long exam, only to find 4 or 5 mistakes in the questions in the middle of the exam. Then he would make excuses that it's because he printed out the old version, although it is written clearly that the exam paper is for that semester. It is surprising how little effort and care he put in this course.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is normal. Just Mid-term and final exams.<br /><br />We were supposed to have a project. But then Joseph cancelled it saying that there's a lot of public holiday clashing with the lecture time so there wasn't enough time for project presentation.",

Professor Wong, who also taught intro to biot, sometimes share his experience on GM fish and fishing during lesson. Sometimes he will ask you question but not difficult. if no one answer he will answer it himself. He said used to have lab for this course but cancelled. If there is a lab course, it may be easier for students to follow. <br /><br />But his powerpoint is quite messy, he prefer you to jot notes. He upload ppt after lecture. He still haven't upload ppt until a few (1/2? forgot) weeks before exam.",

A follow up 1 page essay on the same topic later on. No midterm, only final exam. He said the presentation of the project is the midterm... The workload may depend on his decision that year, may vary different semester ... Final exam include MC and essay. One question about salmon",
