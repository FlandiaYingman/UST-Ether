        "description": "This hands-on course is designed to develop skills in aspiring sustainability practitioners. Understanding sustainability requires a deep appreciation of the complexities of human behavior. This course will examine the kinds of influences on how people make decisions, react to certain incentives and inducements, and make sense of competing interests. Building on this understanding, students will learn to collect and analyze data relevant to sustainable behaviors, particularly within the context of green buildings. Finally, students will use the data to design a real-time intervention intended to shift behaviors in a more sustainable direction. Instructor consent is required.",
