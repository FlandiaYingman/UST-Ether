            "comment_content": "Comprehensive course covering a multitude of computer vision topics. Heavily based on CMU 16-385. The list of topics can be grouped into the categories below:<br /><br />- Image filters, feature extraction and matching<br />- Matching with cameras: homographies and stereo<br />- Radiometry, photometric stero, image processing (*)<br />- Traditional image classification: BoW, KNN, SVM etc.<br />- Introduction to NN and CNN<br />- Object tracking with optical flow<br />- Semantic segmentation (*)<br />- Visual SLAM (**)<br /><br />* Not covered by assigments<br />** Not covered by assignments and exam<br /><br />Previous knowledge in linear algebra is required.<br /><br />This course only touches on the basics of neural networks-based computer vision. If you are looking for newer DL architectures / techniques then COMP5214 should be more suited for you.",
            "comment_teaching": "Frankly speaking, Prof. Xu's delivery of the course materials are a bit bland and mostly involves reading from the slides. It does not help that the slides themselves are typically lengthy and not well organised.<br /><br />Nevertheless, both Xu and the TA are very responsive towards emails and students' questions.",
            "comment_grading": "My scores for reference:<br />HW (70%) 754/758<br />Final (30%) 75/90<br />Total 94.63% -&gt; A<br /><br />Prof. Xu did not release details on grade distribution other than guaranteeing half of the class get A- or above.<br /><br />There are only 4 students who scored higher than me so I am *guessing* that absolute grading is used, with 95% being the threshold for A+. Roughly 60% of the class got &gt;90% so that is likely the level needed to get A- or above.<br /><br />In general the A-range is wide but A+ is only given to the top scorers. If that is your goal you may want to pay more attention to studying for the final exam (which I didn't) since a lot of people would be getting full scores on the assignments.",
            "comment_workload": "There is a total of 5 assignments, which weirdly enough are not arranged in ascending order:<br /><br />PA2: Feature descriptors &amp; homographies<br />PA4: 3D reconstruction<br />PA1: Spatial pyramid scene classification<br />PA5: Neural networks for <br />PA3: Object tracking with optical flow (Lucas-Kanade)<br /><br />Project workload is very high. I spent a lot of time dealing with assignments even with prior experience in OpenCV and Pytorch.<br /><br />The instructions for each assignment are quite convoluted; some tasks are to be implemented in code, some are theoretical questions which needs to be answered in a typed report, and some require both.<br /><br />The good news is that there are (a lot of) project code on Github for one's reference, mostly by CMU students. You may want to check those if you got stuck doing the assignments. There are also a total of 10 grace days for late submission, without any score deduction. They helped a lot when I was coping with paper deadline during March.<br /><br />In contrast, the final exam is relatively easier to prepare as it is fully open-notes and in MC questions only (though this may change when online courses revert to normal mode in the future). The only challenge lies within completing the exam under the limited time frame.",

Instead, focusing on understanding fundamental concepts and critical topics, such as SVD, the epipolar line, the essential matrix, and the optical flow equation, will suffice.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is really bad! I found it difficult to comprehend the professor's lectures due to his challenging accent and presentation style.

The majority of the final grade is decided by the five projects, but the exam also carries significant weight. I am pleased to have earned an A+ for the course, which I attribute to the time I spent studying other universities' exam papers, a technique which proved to be very beneficial for the final exam.",

As a PG student, I found it particularly challenging to spend an average of three days for each project. However, working through these projects ultimately helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the course content. I appreciated the support of the TAs, who were kind and only deducted points for blatantly incorrect results.",
