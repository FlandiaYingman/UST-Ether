Sometimes there are typos. Sometimes the orders are not appropriate.<br /><br />It seems this year more topics are covered. And some seminar-style lectures are given this year. Please see the &quot;Teaching&quot; part.",

            "comment_grading": "The assignments are graded this year and the prof discusses some common mistakes during the lecture.<br /><br />The final is mainly about the first several chapters, which emphasizes asymptotic efficiency a lot this year. <br /><br />The grading should be fine since getting very slightly above the overall mean is enough for an A. But if you aim at A+, you cannot lose too many marks in the final.",
