        "description": "This course will cover some basic topics in the theory of multi-dimensional systems of hyperbolic conservation laws which include: local well-posenedess of the initial value problems for quasi-linear symmetric hyperbolic systems, initial boundary value problems and admissible boundary conditions, development of geometric singularities and formation of shocks; Krushkov theory for scalar quasilinear conservation laws in multi-dimensions; structural stability of elementary waves; shock-development problems, physically relevant wave patterns in compressible fluids; non-uniqueness problem and convex integrations, and some current research topics if time is allowed.",
