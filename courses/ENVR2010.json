We did one experiments in class, we talked a lot of environmental news which inevitably will be used in final, but it is not he most important things you have to study in final. He will mention a lot of stuffs hat is not in the teaching powerpoint, so REMEMBER to take notes or ask friend for help.",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is ok, better than other courses. I got mean in project and 15 ish points higher than mean in finals, also I only miss 1 or 2 lectures, I got a B+. The professor recognize all the faces in class, so you might want to be active in class and attend as much as you can, though there are no attendence.",

Materials for final isn't that much personally if you have already paid attention in class. Last the project, which is a presentation on an environmental issue which is related to us, it takes the most of the time but personally (our group ) is pretty chill so no stress.",
