            "comment_content": "There are a total of three parts in the course:<br /><br />PART ONE:&nbsp;&nbsp;SOCIAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT<br />PART TWO. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INEQUALITIES<br />PART THREE. IDENTITY, INTIMACY AND FAMILY<br /><br />There are three to four topics in each part. The topics are usually related to some of the social phenomenon and their explanation.<br /><br />The topics covered are quite board, without much special focuses. In my opinion, it is not too good to cover that wide range content for a introductory sociology course. It feels like the course is just lots of theories and phenomenons crammed into a single thing. It is quite difficult for a beginner (like me) to handle such amount of content.<br /><br />I have taken an introductory sociology course (it is about HK society too) from another institution before. It focused only a few theories and elaborated each in details with a case. Maybe I have an more like an engineer mindset so I would prefer more structured things lol.<br /><br />BTW Is that a common thing in HKUST? COMP 3711H and COMP 3511 gave me the same feeling.",
            "comment_teaching": "I think it quite depends on the teaching style that you prefer. I don't really like his style of teaching although others may fine with such a style.<br /><br />The professor releases powerpoints after the lectures. For me, it is quite hard to catch up the progress in the lectures especially in this online setting. I prefer doing some preparation before lecture time and write some notes on the slides.<br /><br />Despite all of that, I believe the professor is a nice and passionate person. He tried quite hard to make the lectures interactive.",
            "comment_grading": "Should be similar to (or a little bit better than) normal UST grading. I got a little bit below mean for midterm I and final and slightly above mean in midterm II. I guess I would be slightly below mean in the overall score and it is reasonable to have a B-. I answered a few questions in class but not many so I am not sure about my participation marks.<br /><br />My score (and score stats of this class):<br />Midterm I (25%): 21/31 (Mean: 22.29, Median: 23, SD: 4.84)<br />Midterm II (25%): 27/30 (Mean: 24.3, Median: 25.75, SD: 4.82)<br />Final (50%): 21/32 (Mean: 22.03, Median: 23, SD: 5.62)<br />Participation (Bonus, max 3%): unknown <br />Overall: 72.2% =&gt; B-<br /><br />However, it should be noted that it is not easy to be above mean unless you have some experience on this kind of sociology course (or you are a hok ba).",
            "comment_workload": "It you skip the assigned readings, the workload is just attending the lectures and exams.<br /><br />There is no attendance taking in the lectures. However, you need to answer the questions in order to earn bonus participation points. There are also interactive components in the lectures that you would be able to experience when watching videos (e.g. breakout room discussion, drawings).<br /><br />You can predict the kind of questions that would appear after having one or two midterms. I think the ratio of conceptual question vs the factual questions is about 1:1. You have to recite quite a lot of details meanwhile understand the concepts well to get a high score. I personally did not prepare well and often forget the facts and concepts. You have to spend quite some time for revision if you would like to aim high.",

Contents of documentary videos may also be tested, but is not very difficult. You should be able to choose the correct answers if you watched the documentary videos.
