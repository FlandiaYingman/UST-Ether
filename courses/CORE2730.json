        "description": "The course will initiate a sociologically informed conversation about formal education. What social and organizational forces have shaped current educational practices, and how can they be reformed? How does schooling perpetuate inequalities? Why do boys perform so poorly compared to girls in schools? How can ethnic minorities be better served in educational systems? What is the role of the humanities and creativity in education? Why do people now question the value of higher education? What is the future of education? To answer these questions, students will be encouraged to reflect upon their own educational experiences, read sociological accounts of education and participate in contemporary debates about education at all levels in Hong Kong and across cultures.",
