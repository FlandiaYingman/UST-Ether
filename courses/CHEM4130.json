        "description": "This course will introduce the chemistry principles underlying the drug-target interaction and the development of drugs. One of its major topics is the molecular basis of the interaction of medicinal compounds with various biomolecules and the effect of their structure on their therapeutic activities. In addition, this course will discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of therapeutic agents and how these properties are related to their chemical structure. Moreover, another focus of this course is the chemical strategies to discover and optimize lead compounds that can eventually develop into agents of therapeutic values. For CHEM students and students with instructor's approval only.",

The first part is about the targets of drugs and how drugs 'attack' these targets to cure diseases. The second part is about how to discover,optimize a new drug. The whole course has a great emphasis on your proficiency in writing mechanism for organic reaction.",
