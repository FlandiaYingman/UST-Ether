            "comment_content": "這一科是量子力學，簡稱QM，<br />textbook是David Griffith 的Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, textbook很薄，比起其他科的textbook可說是毫無起眼，但正正是它那麼毫無起眼，你才會發現這本書實在太簡潔。很多科都是一個sem一本書，大概400-500頁吧。但PHYS3036這一科，只是教一半，200頁左右，餘下的部份屬於PHYS4051 Quantum Mechanics II。可想而知，這科，並不能用頁數多少來形容它的難度，即便是200頁，足以令你比死更難受。<br /><br />1. Wave Function<br />Wave-particle duality, normalization, first quantization rule<br /><br />2. Time-independent Schrodinger Equation<br />Examples of 1D single particle systems<br />bound state, scattering state, tunneling<br />A. Infinite square well<br />B. Quantum harmonic oscillator<br />C.free particle<br />D. delta function potential well<br />E. finite square well<br /><br />3. **Formalism<br />Mathematical devices in QM<br />linear algebra(Hermitian operator, Linear combination)<br />Dirac Bracket notation<br />Hibert space<br />Observables<br />Quantum measurement, quantum collapsing<br />eigenvalues and eigenstates<br /><br />4. Quantum Mechanics in 3D<br />Hydrogen atom (radial and angular part)<br />Energy levels, quantum numbers, conservation of orbital angular momentum, degeneracy, spin <br /><br />5. Identical Particles<br />non-interacting particles, distinguishable and indistinguishable, symmetry, boson, fermion, chemical bonding<br /><br />因為QM涉及Linear Algebra、ODE、一定程度的Calculus、Matrix、Fourier Transform、Spherical Coordinate，還有modern physics的底子(Blackbody Radiation，special relativity.....)。困難之處在於很confusing，很abstract，而且你不能夠&quot;明&quot;，你只能令自己less confuse。因為這個世界上沒有人明白量子力學，很多人會問&quot;點解&quot;，&quot;點解這樣&quot;，&quot;點解那樣&quot;，梁伯和教授的答案通常都是&quot;Good Questions, this question is so good that I don't need to answer, and you know the answer. If it works, it works, if it doesn't work, throw it away, but it turns out that it works, so your question is good, but also stupid.&quot;",
            "comment_teaching": "梁伯和教授，外號&quot;梁伯&quot;，科大理學院副院長，多次獲得十大最佳教員(Best Ten Lecturer)，被學生譽為科大物理系最佳教授。上課的氣氛很好，梁伯和教授的教授方式也算是生動有趣，他教學的思路是refresh學生的memory，還好喜歡問一些遲到的學生問題，弄得學生們又愛又恨。我本以為過了midterm有很多人走堂，不過出乎意料很多學生仍然堅持上堂，或者是受梁伯和教授的氣場影響吧。<br /><br />梁伯和喜歡引起學生的注意，例如會用法文讀那些數學家(除了物理學家之外，有很多法國數學家都有份建立QM) ，例如Fourier、Legendre、Laguerre、Hermite，還有些很出名但唔識讀的科學家Schrodinger、Stern、Gerlach、Dirac、Pauli、von Neumann、Clebsch......<br />1.他畫過Q太郎來介紹建立spin angular momentum的方式<br />2.在解釋non-interacting particle的時候，他說&quot;甚麼是non-interacting，我在走廊見到你，你同我say hi，我又同你say hi，咁我們係interacting，因為有interaction。但如果你扮見我唔到，搵第二條路走，咁我地就係non-interacting&quot;<br />3.又例如講Quantum Harmonic Oscillator的時候，說明有minimum但冇maximum，他就說&quot;You see, quantum mechanics can bring you to the heaven, but cannot bring you to the hell&quot;........<br />4.&quot;For a mathematicians, they can say QED here,(QED means as demonstrated above), but for physicists, QED means Quantum Electrodynamics, it doesn't mean that you can go home and sleep&quot;<br />5.他很喜歡說even kindergarten student know, e.g. &quot;Did you learn ODE, it is easy, even a kindergarten student knows&quot;<br /><br />梁伯和教授對教學很有熱誠，亦很清楚QM的難處，他也試圖用生動的方法教導學生。全班近120人，他可以認得出所有學生，派midterm的時候，他是逐份卷派到學生面前的，可見他每年都會強行記下學生的姓名和外貌。那個學生有上堂，那個學生走了堂，他了然於胸<br /><br />梁伯和教授也有缺點，他用白板不用powerpoint，那就令很多坐左邊，右邊和後面的學生難以看清楚白板，特別是那些寫得很細的subscript和superscript，而且，他又好衰唔衰間中會寫錯字，所以上課的時候也要很留心，聽清楚睇清楚。加上他說話很快，跟甩了就係咁先。",
            "comment_grading": "HW約10%<br />quiz約15%<br />midterm 30%<br />final 45%<br /><br />但final高分過midterm可以75%都計final, midterm唔計<br /><br />有時遇到很多艱深難明的concept，實在很洩氣，所以很多學生都被這一科打沉了。Midterm的成績分佈是exponential decay，總分100，mean 30，sd 17，其實都幾得人驚。不過，量子力學是要用另類方式來學習的，通過這些特有方式，你會認識到世界，找到了解世界的另一面，量子力學&quot;科學&quot;得來很&quot;哲學&quot;，因為現實得來很不實際，有用得來又好像沒有甚麼應用。",

The interpretation of quantum mechanics using vector spaces and inner products. The meaning of measurement in quantum mechanics is also discussed.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Solving 3D Schrodinger equation with Coulomb potential. Spins and angular momentum are also discussed.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Qualitative analysis of multi-electron atoms and multi-particle systems.",

So the workload from homework should be quite light.<br /><br />There is a weekly quiz conducted in the first 10 minutes of each tutorial. Due to the pandemic situation, all quizzes are conducted in Canvas and are open book and notes. Most questions are either MC or filling in a number, so they should be rather easy given a basic understanding of lecture materials.<br /><br />Midterm and final exams are open books and notes (due to online exam). The questions are pretty much similar to homework questions and textbook problems.",

Although we&nbsp;&nbsp;have lecture notes alongside, it was difficult to follow especially when you need to sit at the side of classroom(why dun he write on a paper and project it to the screen??). And I think his tone was quite boring that you could easily fall sleep. However, the notes are quite clear and you could ask him the ans. of the blank after class if you miss it.",

            "comment_workload": "You have weekly quiz which always test you concept(very few were calculation but they were very simple) and it forced me to revise(lol). You also have weekly hw that were textbook questions(i.e. all ans can be googled) except 1 holiday hw.<br />For exam revision, I think ch1-ch3(midterm) is not that difficult. However, when we hit ch4 that focus on angular momentum, I spent a lot more time to revise.",
