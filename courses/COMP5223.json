        "description": "This course introduces the essential theoretical frameworks, methods, concepts, tools and techniques used to enable robotic perception and behavior, with particular emphasis on applications in autonomous mobile robots. The course starts from Bayesian programming and probabilistic methods, and then moves on to cover generic machine learning, especially deep learning. For each knowledge point, practical examples will be discussed with guidance to selection of methods. It also covers reinforcement learning with the application in complex system control. Important libraries for hands-on experiments for mobile robotic systems will be introduced. The students will have the opportunity to test their algorithms and implementations on real platforms.",
