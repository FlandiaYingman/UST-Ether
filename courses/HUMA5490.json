        "description": "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, or Liaozhai Zhiyi, is the most outstanding short story collection in classical Chinese literature. Crafted by Pu Songling (1640-1715) during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, this book contains more than 500 stories and depicts an array of characters in the society, such as court officials, civilians, intellectuals, merchants, peasants, pawns, and labours. It tells various stories about fox fairies, ghosts, gods from heaven in spatial settings including city and village, earth and ocean, the human world and the hell. Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio also brings a rich touch of humanities in plurality and diversity. Accordingly, this course intends to evoke students' imaginability as well as creativity in novel creation through analyses on Pu Songling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and investigations on the contemporary Chinese short stories and traditional Chinese literary cannons.",
