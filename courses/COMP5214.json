        "description": "This course focuses on advanced deep learning architectures and their applications in various areas. Specifically, the topics include various deep neural network architectures with applications in computer vision, signal processing, graph analysis, and natural language processing. Different state-of-the-art neural network models will be introduced, including graph neural networks, normalizing flows, point cloud models, sparse convolutions,and neural architecture search. The students have the opportunities to implement deep learning models for some AI-related tasks such as visual perception, image processing and generation, graph processing, speech enhancement, sentiment classification, and novel view synthesis.",

            "comment_content": "Obviously the content is designed to be very fruitful.<br /><br />Topic 1. Introduction and matrix calculus<br />Topic 2. MLP<br />Topic 3. CNN<br />Topic 4.

Efficient nets<br />Topic 20. \tImplicit Models for Scene Representations<br />Topic 21. Transformer (which was originally for NLP) applied in CV<br /><br />The content is very broad, and supposed to be very in depth as well. But it turns out that I didn't get in depth understanding in many of the topics, and even 0 understanding in certain topics. I think there are several reasons for this:<br />1. Disappointing teaching (See teaching section)<br />2. I am a yr2 undergraduate student with absolutely no ML background before this course. This was literally my 1st course in deep learning, I had to spent a huge lot of effort to catch up. Perhaps I could have had better understanding if I had some DL background before this.<br />3. The schedule is too tightly designed. Most contents are simply &quot;copied and pasted&quot; from somewhere else yet not fully and decently copied to achieve the same outcome. Let me show you some facts. <br />Topic2, 3, 4 are copied from MIT's 6.S191, each topic is same as one lecture in MIT, but MIT had sepcific follow up labs designed for each lecture to facilitate full understanding. Luckily PA1 was designed on MLP and CNN, but RNN was never properly practiced. If MIT students even need follow up lab to fully understand, it's very difficult for us (as least for me) to fully understand without proper practice.<br />Topic 5, 6, 7 are copied from UCBerkely's STAT157. Same as topic2, 3 and 4, each topic is same as one lecture in UCBerkely, but they had sepcific follow up labs designed for each lecture to facilitate full understanding. And we had absoulutely no practice on these. No PAs or any labs. <br />Topic 13-14 are from Stanford CS224W. However this was literally &quot;cut out from the middle&quot;. The corresponding lectures in topic 13-14 was somewhere around chapter 8 or 9 in CS224W. Yet the background knowledege necessary which stanford obviously introduced in their previous 7 chapters was never introduced here. I had great trouble understanding many things without those background and had refer to Youtube videos of CS224W to get the background first before understanding this topic. And we only spent two lectures to cover almost 3.5 lectures of content in stanford. It's way too tight. <br />Topic 15-16 was from Stanford CS224N. Similarly, only 2 lectures were spent to cover 3 lectures of content in stanford. <br /><br />Btw, MIT 6.S191, UCB stat157, Stanford cs224W cs224N are all available on youtube. If you take this course, the youtube videos are way more helpful than cqf's lectures",
            "comment_teaching": "Cqf is probably the most talented, high potential, productive and youngest computer vision researcher not only in ust, but in the whole world. He recieved his Bsc in cs and math from hkust with the academic achievement metal, published a first authour CVPR paper during undegraduate studies, and received his phd from stanford. Clearly he is a genius. I respect and admire him in almost every possible way. <br /><br />However, probably because of his way outstanding intelligence, he is terrible at prsentations. First of all his English isn't that good, but that's not the biggest problem. As mentioned in the &quot;content&quot; section, most content are copied from courses in other universities, which obviously include the slides. But different type of slides are meant to be suitable for different type of presenters. In MIT, Stanford, UCB, the lecturer obviously can explain the logic and concept in a very clear and organized manner, so even if they just read the slides, which they obviously don't, at least their conjuction and elaboration helps you understand. But cqf just follow and read the slides directly, with almost no elaboration and conjunction. Sometimes I don't even understand what just happend from one slide to another, has the topic changed? And he sometimes just google paper and videos on the spot, it was as if he just thought of it out of nowhere as if he didn't even prepare for the lesson. <br /><br />Again, almost all lectures can be found on Youtube, they are by all means more helpful than the lectures.",
            "comment_grading": "Homework:&nbsp;&nbsp;30%<br />Midterm:\t35%<br />Presentation:\t5%<br />Final project:\t30%<br /><br />I think it's just usual grading for a PG course. <br />I got full in PAs, full in presentation, above mean by something (but not that much) in the midterm, and around 96.7% for project. Ended up with an A-. <br /><br />Since someone in another review mentioned getting B+ for getting mean, I suppose it's not really that &quot;good grade&quot; for a PG course. Since lower than B+ was considered to be &quot;F&quot; or something for PG students, I'm not sure. <br /><br />I am really not satisfied with the marking of project proposal by the TAs. Our group got a huge mark deduction in the project proposal. And the major deduction point was on &quot;writing style&quot; and &quot;citation&quot;. But on the course project website it clearly stated that only the milestone and final report has such citation and style requirement, yet they deducted marks for that in the proposal. Come on, if you want to duduct marks for certain criteria, at least make it clear in the instructions. They did add back a few points after appealling, but it's not the scores we imagined when writing that proposal. The marking of midterm, project milestone and project report was fair enough.",
            "comment_workload": "Here is something funny, half of the workload was spent on trying to find out which lecture is copied from where XD<br /><br />Well anyway, after finding out where the lectures came from, life was much easier. But as I am just a yr2 undergrad with no ML background at all, the workload for me was indeed quite big. I had to make extra efforts to understand many basic concepts, and the project was also very time consuming despite the topic of our project was already fairly simple. <br /><br />I would say this is NOT a good option as &quot;first course in deep learning&quot;. I did learn quite a lot though, but it was indeed very exhausting. :(",

Thus, the content is somehow fragmentary. The assignment is also from different courses, and all require at least some basic machine learning skills to start. No need to say that the project starts with bare machine learning topics. Therefore I do not recommend anyone without a machine learning background to take the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "CQF is a good supervisor, I mean if you work with him to do UROP or FYP or even Ph.D., he is very nice. But this does not mean he is good at teaching the lectures. To be honest, I cannot focus on most of the lectures since he is just reading the slices with a very flat tongue, and it is easy to fall asleep. Sometimes he will mention some techniques and research works, and open Google to search for the paper. However, this does not help with the understanding: you may get more confused and may need more time to have a glance at the paper he mentioned.<br /><br />I think missing the lectures would not affect your understanding of the content. It is recommended to find the original lectures of the slices on the internet.",

I got full marks in Homework, above 0.7 SD in Midterm, full in presentation, and 96% in the final project, and finally got an A-. The mean seems to be B+, and this is astonishing since for PG the B means pass. I think the project and homework are hard to distinguish the grade curve so the midterm is important.

Each homework may require a single day to do, but there is only 3 homework and you have a total of 8 late days for them (at most 4 for a single homework). The project is the most important: you can form a group of at most 3 people, and if all your groupmates (and you) would contribute to the project, the workload is not big at all. But if one of your partners is a free rider, you may have miserable days and nights near the deadline.",
