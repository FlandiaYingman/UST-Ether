            "comment_content": "Generally, group of 4 students (2 from UST, 2 from China Academy of Art) worked together spending first 2 weeks in Hangzhou and 2 weeks in UST. Every students get chance to know each other and time to hangout with new friends in Hangzhou at the start of the course. Then, we have classes for getting innovative idea and how to do the proper design thinking which takes a lot of time. Back in UST, you make the actual product together. Barely have resting time, but I am sure you will enjoy it if you are an engineer.",
            "comment_teaching": "There is no actual teaching like lecture in UST. You can get advice from professors and TAs in order to get the basic direction but no one will tell you which direction is correct. So it is important to get involved in group discussion and bring out as many opinions as possible, otherwise you will end up making horrible product.",
            "comment_grading": "Frankly speaking, grading would depend on how good and innovative is your idea. Then, there are video-making and product report at the end of the course but not that burdensome. So, I recommend you to spend longtime when planning your product.",
            "comment_workload": "Depends on your product because no one is giving pressure for hard working. I wrote D because my product required large amount of time for making. The more time you spend on your product, your product will become more fancy and beautiful.",

            "comment_content": "We had to pair up with students from The China Academy of Art (Hangzhou) and spent 2 weeks in HKUST and Hangzhou respectively. It was interdisciplinary- 2 STEM students in UST paired up with 2 Art/Media students in CAA. I would really recommend this course as design thinking is a highly demanded skill in many companies. Being able to brainstorm 1000 ideas and just choose and develop 1 is very useful.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Ravi was the main professor leading the course. Although there was support from other professors (Pedro Sander, Emily Au and 2-3 professors from The China Academy of Art in Hangzhou), Ravi was in charge of the course planning and direction. His many years of experience in design thinking really helped us accelerate the planning process.",
            "comment_grading": "I got a fantastic grade in this course, but only because our team worked hard. You have to be passionate and determined if you want to excel. I did not think too much about the grade or result while working, I just kept pushing on and leading the team. The deliverable is showcasing our product in the UST library - to Tony Chan and&nbsp;&nbsp;the target audience (Elderly). Seeing the smile on the Elderly's face while they interacted with our product was the most memorable experience for me.",
            "comment_workload": "I will not say that the workload is light - it isn't. You have to design and manufacture a prototype in merely 3 weeks, albeit in a team. You have to work for about 6-7 hours a day if you want to accomplish this. Needless to say, the intense atmosphere and useful coaching from Prof. Ravi really made the course fun and enjoyable. So, the 'D' is not really negative.",

There are no reading materials or exams. You just have to identify the problem, develop your ideas and build the product. For us, we had to build a product that can help elderly in terms of mobility and cognition. <br />Also, other than academic part of this program, you will get to stay with 40 students entire month! By the end of the program, you will definitely feel as if they are your family. I can say that this course is not like any other course I have taken so far in HKUST.",
