        "description": "This course introduces fundamentals of protein science as well as rational design and evolutionary approaches for engineering protein molecules. Protein fundamentals provide the basic knowledge of protein structure and function. Rational design-based protein engineering use several case studies to illustrate the role of modern computational tools in design of functional protein molecules such as catalysts, biosensors, biomaterials, etc. Protein directed evolution topics cover mechanisms of biomolecular evolution, fitness landscapes, examples of successful protein evolution, and metabolic engineering enabled by directed evolution. Homework assignments involve readings only. Students are required to take a final examination (50%) and submit a research proposal inspired by materials presented in the course (50%).",
