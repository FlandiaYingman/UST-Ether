        "description": "This course covers the essential topics on how to apply modern molecular techniques to study the biological and ecological mechanisms of marine organisms and ecosystems. It will provide a comprehensive introduction of different methods, from molecular fingerprinting to next generation high-throughput sequencing, to the studies of â€“omics and meta-omics. It will cover a broad range of marine organisms, from bacteria and their phages to protists, and from marine invertebrates to vertebrates, and a variety of different habitats/ecosystems, such as coral reef and deep seafloor. For LIFS and ENVS students in their third or fourth year of study only.",
