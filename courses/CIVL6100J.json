        "description": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a combination of computational mathematics, fluid mechanics, programming and high performance computing (HPC). It has grown from a mathematical curiosity to become an essential tool in almost every branch of fluid dynamics. This course will introduce the primary components for learning and practicing CFD. During the course, students should obtain basic background on CFD; such as fluid mechanics, turbulence modeling, computational methods, etc.; and its application in different disciplines (e.g. environmental, water resources, mechanical, biological, chemical and aeronautical engineering). Midterm and final projects will help students on how to deal with practical flow problems. Instructorâ€™s consent is needed for enrollment to this course.",
