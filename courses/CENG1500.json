            "comment_content": "(A brief summary of topics below)<br />Assessed in mid-term:<br />Atomic and crystal structures: Atomic structure and bonding, bcc/fcc/hcp structures, lattices, X-ray diffraction, solid solutions, types of defects<br />Diffusion: Process and rate of solid state diffusion<br />Mechanical Properties: Stress and strain, strength, ductility, toughness, hardness, Poisson’s ratio, Griffith crack model, deformations, creep<br />Thermal behavior: Heat capacity, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, thermal shock<br />Assessed in final exam:<br />Phase diagrams: Phases, degree of freedom, microstructures, types of binary phase diagrams, Lever Rule<br />Heat treatment: Solidification, TTT diagrams, isothermal and martensitic transformation, heat treatment processes(e.g. tempering, age hardening)<br />Structure materials: Classification, uses, structure and properties of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites<br />Electronic Materials: Basic concept in electricity, valence and conduction bands, Fermi function, semi-conductors(n-type and p-type)<br /><br />There are also two 'guest lectures': Prof. Sun and Prof. Luo from CENG department talked about biomaterials and nanomaterials respectively. They are less interesting and also won't be assessed in exams.<br /><br />As a year 1 science student who registered this course as a common core, I think that some content of this course is too technical for a common core, emphasizing on some skills that we will barely use in daily life(except for chemical engineers). I also need some time to digest the new concepts in this course as a science student, but they are actually not very hard to understand. It is also strongly advised to have DSE-level Chemistry and Physics background before enrolling in this course. If you a looking for a s&amp;t common core course maybe you should consider other courses first.<br /><br />The contents are perfectly fine for a CENG required course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Shao is a responsible professor who can elaborate concepts clearly and are willing to answer student's questions. His English is sharp but plain, so it is somewhat easy to fall asleep in class, but when I watched the lecture videos I realized that he can explain things quite well. He will also demonstrate example questions in the lesson.<br /><br />His lecture notes are simplified as much as possible, only containing the key points and some key examples to questions. Thus, you need to attend the lessons or watch the lecture videos in order to fully understand the contents, rather than just self-studying with notes.",

While I am not sure if it is true, I think the grading is still quite generous. I get exactly the mean in mid-term(75/100, SD: 12 If I remember it correctly), around 60-70% in homework(Estimated), 9x/100 in final(They didn't release final result, I just estimate by my performance that time, but the final should be easier than mid-term), went to office hour once, didn't do the project, finally I got an A.",
            "comment_workload": "Light workload.<br />Homework: One per week, each consists of 2-4 textbook questions, all are quite straightforward(provided that you understand the concepts), usually you only need to refer to the lecture notes to do them, but sometimes it is better to refer to the textbooks(can borrow from library). However, Prof. Shao said that he may make homeworks more difficult from next year.<br />Project: Optional. A ppt presentation on a specific type of materials (For example, materials in human bones) in the last 2 lessons. Not sure the details of it.<br />Office hour: The only 'attendance' of the course. You must show up at least once during his office hour, otherwise 5 marks will be deducted from your total score(he will keep record of who have shown up and who do not). If you don't have any questions to ask he will just ask you some opinions about the course and suggestions for improvements and then let you go.<br />Exams: I think you will need only a few hours to go through the lecture notes(provided that you attend all lessons/watch all lecture videos). You can borrow the non-compulsory textbook from library reserve to practice on the exam questions. For mid-term you should do more practice on calculations and for final you should do more practice on handling the diagrams(phase diagrams, TTT diagrams). You can ask the professor for detailed textbook solutions guide too.",

Professor Shao claimed that he usually gives pretty high grades for the group projects so definitely consider taking it.<br /><br />As long as you submit the homework on time you'll be given full marks.<br /><br />The midterm exam was more calculation heavy (has 1 short answer question, the rest were all calculations). You should be able to do well if you know how to do the homework questions.<br /><br />The final exam was more balanced (50-50 calculation and short/long answer questions). It was split into two parts. Phase diagrams and heat treatment had a whole part to themselves and accounts for 60 points so focus more on these chapters.

According to the professor, you would need to get at least a 91 to get an A-, 93 to get an A and 95 to get an A+. I don't know why it's this way considering that past means were slightly lower than this year's mean, merely getting mid 80s in previous years would get you an A.

Phase diagrams are very complicated and hard to analyze since there are many different variations and information embedded in it. Search on Youtube for more detailed and clearer explanations. I have studied lectures 11-13 for the longest time, at this moment I still am not sure what is going on in these chapters. The lectures after phase diagram are much more informative with fewer equations, such as introducing heat treatment methods, materials properties, etc. <br /><br />Exams:<br />Midterm includes more calculations, whereas there's a large part in finals asks you to interpret the phase diagram and TTT diagram. Both exams do not have essay type questions. <br /><br />Presentation:<br />You can choose to do or not. The topics are very wide, it only requires you to introduce a material, you don't have to link it with the concepts learnt. A group consists of 1-2 people, most people do it solo.

            "comment_teaching": "He reads out the powerpoints and explains the concepts very clearly. However, his Chinese accent is quite thick. So I suggest you to not go to lessons, and just watch the lecture video so that you can go back and replay.<br /><br />He is also very willing to answer questions. He has an office hour every Monday where you can go to ask him in his office (or via zoom, spring 2020 review here)",

Answers to the questions will be uploaded to canvas.<br /><br />I did the project; recommend you to do the project too as it helps with the weighting. The project is basically a presentation on any material you like. It can be a material taught in class, or out-of-syllabus. The presentation is 12-15 mins, and you can do it by yourself or in a pair. He grades the presentation based on presentation skills rather than the actual information delivered, so as long as you are a confident speaker, you will get a good mark for the presentation. <br /><br />I saw in previous reviews that the office hour is necessary or else 5 marks will be deducted from the final score. For this sem, the office hour wasn't necessary because of the online arrangements.",
            "comment_workload": "Weekly assignments. Quite easy. Question style is like the questions in the midterm and final, so it is good practice. <br /><br />since both exams are open books and notes, you can just print the lecture notes out and bring them to the exam.",

Lecture powerpoints involves some images and few words that you couldn't understand them easily. I tried to read e-book but it is hard to turn from pages to pages since it contains too many pages.

            "comment_grading": "hw<br />midterm<br />final<br />project (optional)<br /><br />Many people got very highhhh scoreeee!!!!<br />For midterm, my score: 58/100, mean: 66, median: 71<br />omg! I need to work much harder!!<br />Yay, I got 81 in final, however mean: 78, median: 84<br />That means many students also got much higher score in final. I have achieved a breakthrough in final but still couldn't compete with other students.<br /><br />Midterm involve the content from lecture 1 to 9 and final involve the remaining lectures only. Open book&amp;notes for both exams.<br /><br />You need to understand all of the concepts clearly in order to get good score. The scores in the exams are distributed unevenly.<br /><br />I heard that the exam papers are almost the same for every year. So it benefit those who got past paper a lot. Since I don't have friend in class and no one willing to share past papers with me, and I also don't want to spend a few hundred dollars to buy them, I got a C+ grade eventually. You would get bad grade even you don't make careless mistakes since there are a lot of explanation type question in final exam and it is hard to get full mark in that kind of question unless you have standard answer from past paper. Don't enroll in this course if you are a person like me or else C range is waiting for you.<br /><br />Btw, what I want to tell about final exam is that there is a 6 score question that ask you to write 500 words essay on how material change the world. 6 score is too low but it is worth to prepare the essay before final exam so that you can directly copy it during the exam. I know it because some people told in the past reviews. The essay question will probably not changed I guess.<br /><br />ps: got 4 and 5 in dse chem and phy respectively",
