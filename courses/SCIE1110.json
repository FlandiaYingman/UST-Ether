Terrible.<br /><br />The first part was the boring-as-fuck history of chemistry development, including the false Phlogiston theory, discovery of elements, and contribution from different chemists. (need to RECITE!!!)<br /><br />It also included the introduction to the concepts of atoms, several fundamental laws of chemistry, the atomic theory, the periodic table, Bohr's quantum model of atom, concepts of atomic orbitals, chemical bondings, electronegativity, chemical structures, the mechanism of chemical reactions, thermochemistry, chemical equilibria and at last, chemical analysis.<br /><br />üìÇ PHYS:<br />The first part is the boring-as-fuck history of astronomical science, including a lot of false theories like Celestial Dome theory, geocentric model, and the Copernican revolution.<br /><br />Then it was followed by the philosophy of Newtonian's mechanics, thermodynamics, Carnot cycle, Einstein's general and special relativity (with its application in GPS), quantum mechanics, EPR paradox and Bell's theorem. <br /><br />At last, it ended up in the philosophy of what we perceived as &quot;objective reality&quot; and a description of every unobservable thing as &quot;wavefunction&quot; which would certainly burn your head and fuck you up in the exams. My warning - physics without maths is even more horrible.<br /><br />üìÇ LIFS:<br />Lots and lots of endless reading materials causing intense headache.<br /><br />He will blast you in the lectures by challenging you philosophical questions like what defines you, or whether you're obliged to take drugs which hinders the progress of elimination and survival of the fittest in evolution, or whether &quot;gene drive&quot; or eliminating the whole species of a certain mosquito to prevent virus spreading is morally justifiable.<br /><br />Nothing much to say.

I wasn't even able to finish it in the 1-hour time limit and Ieft like a third of the whole paper blank. Damn!!! But after all it's King Chow's crazy style. Btw your English level and your writing speed are directly related to your exam result. But dun feel disappointed when u receive low marks, cuz EVERYONE will screw up the lifs part (mean is below 30%).<br /><br />Note the increased cut-off compared to previous years: (DAMN!!!)<br />82% -&gt; A+ (1)<br />76% -&gt; A (5)<br />73% -&gt; A- (5)<br />68% -&gt; B+ (9)<br />64% -&gt; B (8)<br />60% -&gt; B- (14)<br />56% -&gt; C+ (12)<br />51% -&gt; C (8)<br />41% -&gt; C- (9)<br />35% -&gt; D (2)<br />&lt;35% -&gt; F (2)<br /><br />15% A-range, 41% B-range, 39% C-range<br /><br />I got the second highest score (78.4%) in the class and ended up in an A.

            "comment_content": "IMPORTANT: Don't take this course if you haven't learnt CHEM and PHYS before, trust me, you will die. <br /><br />If you have science background, continue reading, I'm here to help. :)<br /><br />Course is split into 4 modules, 6 lessons each. Mid term covers the CHEM and PHYS modules, Final covers the MATH and LIFS modules. <br /><br />=CHEM=<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Talks about the history of Chemistry. The first few lectures are about the discovery of elements, and then we explored the discovery of chemical structures, and a bit of analytical Chemistry. (Fun fact: Wanna know how phosphorus was discovered? Well a guy tried to make gold by boiling his own piss. He was left with a glowing residue which turned out to be phosphorous.) Sounds fun, right? Now imagine that repeated for 6 lectures 60 pages per lecture. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is, the exam consist of questions like identifying isomers, chemical structures, finding chiral centers... which the professor spent like 5 minutes explaining (really?). If you haven't studied chemistry before, there is no way in hell that you will be able to understand the concept, so please do yourself a favor and don't take this course. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;//How to survive// <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have studied chemistry before, here's what you wanna do: <br />-Focus more time on revising the CHEM exam cuz that will earn you easy marks. <br />-Memorize the scientists' name and year of discovery. (This is have absolutely no use in your life but at least you will have a decent grade)<br />-**Study the past paper very carefully!!! MUST OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE EXAM ARE COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE PAST PAPER!!!<br />-**There will be a part in the exam where you will have to fill out missing boxes in the periodic table. All of the elements that you are required to fill in will start with the same alphabet. So you can easily predict what will be in the exam. <br /><br />=PHYS=<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be worst sh_t in your life. This will be worse than anything you have ever experienced before. First they attempted to teach all of the contents in the HKDSE mechanics (From F=ma up to gravitation) in one lecture. Then they introduced first and 2nd law of thermodynamic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wave-Particle duality, quantum physics and relativity. (Each of those topics they spent 1 lectures to go through)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I am not kidding. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you have learnt all those topics before, (For example if you are a theoretical physicist) There is really no way that you will be able to understand the concepts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;//How to survive// <br />-Take a look at the HKDSE physics textbook before taking the exam. Some of the questions are extremely easy HKDSE level questions. They will allow you to get easy marks. <br />-Memorize as much of the PowerPoint as you can (For example: What happened in Fukushima, how does a laser pointer work etc...) They do not require physics knowledge, but will grant you easy 10-12 marks. <br />-If you have time, go for the &quot;low hanging fruits&quot; such as first and second law of thermodynamics. <br />-**Memorize the year and the scientist of discovery. There will be a 5 mark MC asking those. (5 marks are quite a lot)<br /><br />=MATH= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No Calculus required!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents are quite good. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Talks about 2 of the unsolvable mysteries in MATH (Fancy name is &quot;millennial problems&quot;). Essentially someone some years ago found out that 7 Maths problems are unsolvable, and decides to award 1 million to whoever solves the problem. Some years later, a Russian dude actually solved one of the problem but refuses the 1 millions award cuz he was &quot;picking mushroom&quot; (?) (Seriously look it up). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The two unsolvable problems discussed in the course are &quot;Riemann Hypothesis&quot; and &quot;Poincare conjecture&quot;. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You just have to understand what the problems are about and are not required to actually solve them (Apparently). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;//How to survive// <br />-Try to understand the problems and their derivation, this is no use memorizing in this part. <br />-Watch the lecture videos, ask the professor if necessary. <br /><br />=LIFS= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing much I can say about this part. At late November school was suspended and we were sent annotated Powerpoints to study ourselves. Final exam consist of an essay question which we have 24 hours to workout, subjected to Turnitin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are taking this course this year, chances are your exam will be nothing like ours, so don't bother. <br /><br />=Poster= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asked to create a poster in one of the topics they provided. The competition is NOT strong. Just try to throw as many contents as possible into a piece of very large paper and you will be fine. (I wrote like 3749 words, our poster came second) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The winning group won by their great design and good explaining. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our group mate went missing. I tried to contact him 5 times through out the project but he replied to nothing. I reached out to the professors for help, they couldn't care less. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A ended up doing almost everything for my group cuz Athena is a goooood guyyyyy.",
            "comment_teaching": "=William= (CHEM)<br />Cool guy. I can see that he enjoys teach this subject very much. <br />Attending his lesson feels more like listening to him telling stories. Lessons are enjoyable to attend, exam not much so. <br /><br />=Foreman= (PHYS) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like the walking definition of Physics. Talks in a very flat tone, makes you wanna sleep, loves his mug of coffee.<br />He does not bother explaining the difficult concepts. You won't understand them anyways. He knows that perfectly well. He does not care. <br /><br />=Frederick Fong= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I would date him. (No joke)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes many joke (Although most of them are awkward). Makes the topic very interesting to study. Does a good job explaining the concepts. Willing to answer any questions. Designed the exam in a way that if you revise, you will get full marks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just... very cute! xx<br /><br />=Wu something= (LIFS)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Because school was suspended, I have not seen him before, and I have only heard his voice through the annotated ppt.

This lack of care led the class average of the physics exam to be 52% which was shocking given the average of the other tests were around 70%. To make up for this, the professor and TA (Dr. Peter Cheung) decided to basically add 20% to everyone's grade. Also, more than half the class got the PRS questions wrong.<br /><br />Mathematics<br />I think professor Fong was by far the best instructor of the four. He made the content simple, engaged the class and generally brought a good vibe to lectures. His teaching is the only reason why I'm not giving this section an E.<br /><br />Life Sciences<br />The lectures were extremely boring. Professor Wong made little effort in making the material interesting, and instead jumped from topic to topic which made the lectures confusing.<br /><br />TA<br />Dr. Peter Cheung was amazing. He was incredibly nice and really tried his best to help the students. He facilitated our group chat and gave us lots of advice and was the bridge between the students and professors.

As mentioned in the teaching section, professor Foreman did not go over any of the calculations which then pulled the average down since half the paper was just calculation questions.<br />Me: 81.67% (61% before they made the adjustment)<br />Average: (52%)<br /><br />Mathematics<br />Three questions, one on each topic.

I predicted it may appear in mid-term, and my prediction was correct: Quite a lot of MCs were those information.

Don't panic. Simply complete past papers provided will be OK, given that you understand the definitions of some specific terms will be fine. Professor will unexpectedly state the key of how to distinguish between some properties.<br /><br />PHYS: First came a bunch of physics quantities, then discussed the history of the discovery of some important theories.<br /><br />CHEM: Seemed like a history of Chemistry discoveries mixed with Chemical knowledge.<br /><br />Even if the content seemed interesting at first, the course was dull in some modules.",

With the help of the easy and little content, he may be the only professor that I was willing to listen. The calculations were simple that he needed not to elaborate much. <br /><br />Cheung was the professor of PHYS part. He either only read out the words of Powerpoint or elaborated inadequately for some complicated parts.<br /><br />Williams was the professor of CHEM part. Even if the content was lack of linkage, Williams still tried to elaborate them in a simpler way or using definitions, where I was astonished.

Even if I had studied PHYS in high school, the questions were in great amount of memorisations with deep understandings. CHEM was not as disastrous as PHYS as I&nbsp;&nbsp;at least recalled those learnt in high school through lectures. <br /><br />Unless you could go through what you have learnt after lectures as soon as possible, don't choose this course!!",

I am only writing this review based on the professors I met in this term.<br /><br />The contents for my term are listed in the attached files.<br /><br />The course title and contents may sound interesting at first glance but honestly, reality is often far worse. The reviews are true in that you should really not take this course if you don't have a strong science background.",
            "comment_teaching": "LIFS: Prof Wong's lectures are nearly impossible to follow since he jumps from one topic to the next with virtually no coherence. His slides are badly organized and you can't really read anything from them. His pronunciation is bad and sometimes just inaudible, which especially stands out when you attend his lectures through Zoom. He often throws in tiny bits of info, including some very advanced ones like cyclin-dependent kinase, which makes things even worse.<br /><br />MATH: Perhaps the best module. Prof Fong is already popular among students so I bet no need to explain more. He is the only prof who actually treats this course as a 1000-level course. His lectures contain much fewer content compared to other profs' but he spend much time into explaining the concepts carefully so it is worthwhile.<br /><br />PHYS: Dr Cheung's lectures are quite boring since he throws in lots of advanced contents with few detailed explanations and also not good pronunciation. His exam is also quite hard.<br /><br />CHEM: Prof Williams' lectures are also very heavily bombarded with contents on his slides but he does try to explain things a bit clearer. Exam is also not easy but he gives out bonuses based on class activities and he also tries to give you full points for &quot;close-enough&quot; answers.",

Half of them are actually high school biology (he did mentioned those things in the lectures but I managed to answer those questions merely thanks to my high school biology background).<br /><br />MATH: 3 long questions, not easy to finish in 60 min but the question with lowest point will be halved in your total score so try to go all in for 2 questions that you are more confident with before attempting the third one.<br /><br />PHYS: 22 MCs (only 20 needed to get max score). There might be many tricky and difficult questions.<br /><br />CHEM: T/F, MCs and short ans. First 2 parts are mostly theoretical stuff (incl. memorizing chemists and their contributions, this topic carries a significant amount of points so be careful), part 3 has some calculations. If you are not confident with calculations, you replace part 3 with part 4 (long questions) which can be prepared at home (no notes allowed in exam, you have to memorize the info you researched). But be informed that the prof is more lenient in grading part 3 (e.g. full points given for close answers) and stricter for part 4, as he also actively encourages students to choose part 3.<br />Also, many questions are copied from past papers so do have a look at them.<br /><br />My scores:<br />LIFS: 90 (mean 58.75)<br />MATH: 84 (mean 70.08)<br />PHYS: 85 (mean 58.16)<br />CHEM: 100 (mean 74.37)<br />Presentation: 90 (mean 74.8)<br />Total: 89.8<br />Grade: A+",

I would say it's best to review the contents periodically during the term since cramming would be nightmarish, as there is just too many to dealt with as once. And it would be even harder if you haven't learnt these subjects in high school.<br /><br />The presentation won't take long, just spend several days researching, making slides and you'll be fine. You might also want to finish this one early because there is a chance to submit the draft to the profs who can give you feedbacks (especially prof Williams). Our group submitted the slides to him before the deadline for feedbacks so we were able to make lots of crucial changes and had a high score.",

You must have at least some of the background scientific knowledge, especially PHYS and LIFS.<br /><br />I certainly do not advise you to take this course, even though you are a Science student. It is not efficient to acquire knowledge from four different modules in one semester. I would rather take 4 separate courses from each of these fields rather than a 4-in-1 package.",
            "comment_teaching": "MATH:<br />The professor is decent. Can understand what he says during the lectures. However, what needs for the exam is actually less than his ppt. I could say more than half of his ppt is not being taught, instead they are some information for the group project.<br /><br />LIFS:<br />Very interactive with students. May require some reading, but not for exam, just for your own knowledge. The professor is very kind, always trying to let us engage in his lessons.<br /><br />PHYS:<br />Be prepared that some parts are DSE knowledge, e.g. conservation of energy, heat transfer, atomic world, etc. The earlier part of the session is some of the basic knowledge, but it gets harder as the module progresses. <br />It has to be pointed oout that the content it teaches is quite random, from thermodynamics to quantum theory. It's like squeezing different fields of Physics into 6 - 8 lectures. Personally, I find it difficult as I don't know where to start my revision.<br /><br />CHEM:<br />The professor takes 5% attendance from the IPRS system, but that's trivial. Same as LIFS, he is quite interactive. The earlier part is also the fundamentals, but as it progresses, the content is more or less similar to the HKALE syllabus.",
            "comment_grading": "Nothing can be said about the grading as I haven't taken the final exam at the time I write this review. All I could say is the exam paper style is entirely different from each module.<br /><br />MATH:<br />Only consists of 3 questions with sub-questions in each of it. If you happen to get the wrong answer, game over.<br /><br />LIFS:<br />The exam style is interesting, but whether it helps getting a good grade is up to you. The professor emphasized that ALL scientific terms (e.g. DNA, enzyme) should not be memorized, and thus must not appear in your answers. It might be difficult to adapt to this style when formulating an answer.<br /><br />PHYS and CHEM:<br />Their exam papers are very similar. You need to remember the contributions of past scientists and their names for certain questions.<br />PHYS is very random. It's like squeezing lots of random knowledge into one package, leaving you for your own revision.<br />CHEM might be fairly easy since there's not much to memorize. Lots of them are just common sense if you have a scientific background in high school/secondary school.",
            "comment_workload": "Only LIFS requires some reading for in-class discussion. The articles are quite interesting to read through. Perhaps the reading materials for the last LIFS lecture is the most important of all, since you need to debate of certain LIFS topics later on.<br /><br />The workload focuses on group project, which includes Powerpoint presentation and poster presentation. Again, the workload is related to your groupmates. Note that the groupmates are randomly assigned to you, and it usually consists of Year 1, 2, 3, one from each year. In my case, 2 of them are free-riders and deadline fighters. You have to urge them to cooperate, otherwise they won't do it until the last moment. As for the poster presentation, it is the most annoying of all. You need to do a joint payment to print A0 poster for manned presentation during the study break.",

The materials covered are very special that probably no other courses would cover the same thing ( I guess that's why it's a SSC course). For life science, all the things taught are crazily deep and difficult that I was thinking whether I am taking a graduate course. For Physics, things were easy at first but eventually went quite deep ( like proof of thermodynamics, theory of relativity and quantum mechanics). For math, it covered some special topics like different number systems in the world, the logic in math, etc. Chemistry is the only normal part (here abnormal does not necessarily mean a bad thing, I actually love the Physics part). But the professor tended to focus more on history, that is the historical development of chemistry. Some false theories in the old days would be taught too. I think the course name suits the course very much, it's really about great ideas in science.",

King Chow(head of IPO), who is the life science professor, is a crazy guy, but the kind of crazy that I admire. Really a figure in academia. Apart from teaching life science materials he would also cover some philosophical questions like what defines you and what is right and what is wrong (no clear answer usually for these questions). He made the lesson lively and interactive. Once one guy was late and was bombed with tons of questions(questions that requires no knowledge but a lot of thinking) which made the lesson so fun. He is so impressive. The physics professor is a very good teacher and his presentation was clear and often asked for questions. Fair teaching for the math professor but his notes were kind of messy.",

If you choose the latter, good luck.",

            "comment_workload": "Honestly, I only showed up to five lectures throughout the whole course...<br /><br />Maths:<br />The lecture slides from maths are really vague so if your math background isn't strong you should go as this will be difficult. Since I'm from engineering, I didn't bother and literally read some of the slides for the first time during the exam (open book) as it's more about proofs and bullshitting than actual formulas or problems. <br /><br />Chemistry:<br />There are attendance marks for chemistry- if you need an extra ~10% boost in your grade then go to lectures. Overall, as long as you've taken Chemistry in high school this won't be difficult, it just involves memorization of lecture slides.<br /><br />Physics:<br />Once again, it won't be difficult as long as you've taken Physics in high school. Very cookie cutter MCQs and open book exam. <br /><br />Life Science:<br />This is an absolute clusterfuck tbh but I haven't studied biology since year 11 HAHAHA <br />The exam is a wild card, has consistently low means and changes every year depending on the professor. While it's open book but there is so much information you can't possibly process it all during the exam. I suggest you focus on the other three components unless you have a dying passion for this sort of thing. There are ethical/philosophical debates involved so attending lectures may actually be useful for you.<br /><br />Group Project:<br />Teammates are key!!! Luckily I was grouped with people who did their share of the work. Just choose a physics or chemistry module topic and your life will be easier.",

If not, then you will need to spend quite a bit of time completing the poster and presentations. As for the exams:<br /><br />Math: Open book, open notes, open mobile phones (no laptops). Only three question in total and two are proofing questions. However, there will be sample exam beforehand and it is important to go through it very thoroughly.<br /><br />Chemistry: Closed book. I found the exam quite easy actually, he had explained a lot of the questions clearly in class already and most of the others you could solve with a bit of extra thought. There will also be an option to write long answers that are worth half the exam instead of the normal questions. However, I personally recommend doing the normal exam.<br /><br />Physics: Closed book. As usual, class was nice and fun, exam was a total and absolute nightmare. The sample paper he gave was totally useless unfortunately. Unless you understand all the concepts and calculations very very clearly, it is easy to flunk the exam.<br /><br />Life Science: Open book, open notes, open laptop, open everything. But it really doesn't matter because he asks 15 or 16 long answer questions that you need to complete in one hour. So if you need to check the internet for every question, you are pretty much guaranteed to run out of time. Another thing is a lot of questions were based on the examples and discussions that he gave in the lectures, and not on the lecture notes, so attendance is recommended.",

Make sure to print out the 'Homework' and its answers provided by Prof. Yan.. Exam is very similar to the homework. Even if you don't understand the questions try to look up similar questions in the homework and figure out something from answer key.<br /><br />Chem: Close-book. Not much to say about this. If you studied Chem in DSE or CHEM1020 it's not hard.<br /><br />Phys: Close-book. Insanely difficult. Good luck.<br /><br />Lifs: Try to review the lecture videos of Prof. Chow as many times as possible. Read the 'reading materials' provided by him, as they enables you to understand the questions(but doesn't help in answering them anyway). Don't focus too much on lecture notes. Open-book and open-internet, but minimize use of Internet as much as possible to save time and finish more questions.

            "comment_content": "There are 4 modules in the whole syllabus, PHY, MATH, CHEM, BIO. All of the contents are relatively introductory (if you have studied science before). <br /><br />I think the whole course is pretty easy if you attend the lessons and really try to understand the topics. However, it could be quite something when you try to master a subject in 3 weeks (3 months 4 subjects = 3 weeks per subject)<br /><br />Physics focused on wave and relativity; Maths focused on some very conceptual maths and math theories, like how to prove the Euclid Elements and mod; Chemistry focuses on periodic table and the arrangement of electrons and also some history of chemistry; Biology focuses on the meaning of life (a topic that King Chow likes a lot XD) and some basic genetics.<br /><br />All in all, the contents are more elementary level with some science historical knowledge. I think it is pretty well balanced.",
            "comment_teaching": "All of the professors are very nice people and they really try to make the lessons less boring by inducing some interactions and some small jokes (but not always successful)<br /><br />All 4 of them have different teaching style but it is quite easy to follow and they are all very willing to answer questions from students. So if you really do not understand a certain topic or concept, be sure to ask them until you grasp the idea (which is very important to the exam)<br /><br />I remember that my poster topic was on Biology so I sent LOTS of very LONG emails to Professor Chow asking for feedback and opinions, he replied every one of them and answered most of my questions (except those that would directly affect the content of the posters), that really helped me a lot in the poster making process, so just don't be afraid to ask, you may be surprised haha",
            "comment_grading": "I think the grading is fair. The grade is directly affected by how well do you understand the topics, instead of how well you remember stuff from the slides. So like I said before, don't be afraid to ask question and clear any concepts that you don't understand asap. By doing so, it is pretty much guaranteed that you can get above mean results in exams.<br /><br />Grade weighting:<br />80% exams (4 finals, 20% each)<br />20% project (poster presentation and ppt presentation)<br /><br />I got 1 SD higher in the physics, maths exam and mean on the chem exam and the highest in bio (66/100, mean 2x/100). The project part I guess I did ok/above mean (I forgot the score). At last, I got an A+ as an overall grade.",
            "comment_workload": "The only workload that the course have is the poster preparation and powerpoint presentation at the end of the semester, it would be quite an easy task if you and your groupmates are on the same page.<br /><br />However, if you do not have science background, the workload can be quite high. You will have to catch up with the concepts every week and spend maybe 2-3 hours to fully understand the concepts plus you need some extra time to study for the exams.",

            "title": "Not bad in terms of SSC courses",
            "comment_content": "The course covers the scientific development in the four areas. The topics included are roughly as follows:<br />Math: number systems, divisibility, axioms (not tested)<br />Lifs: microscopy, cells, genetics, heredity<br />Phys: energy and entropy, relativity, quantum mechanics<br />Chem: elements, chemical reactions, qualitative and quantitative analysis<br />The topics are quite interesting and inspirational, but the time is really insufficient, resulting in a very shallow coverage of each topic. I would rather to have one topic discussed in-depth for each module.<br />Of course, students with science background would be advantaged (around half of the course content is prior knowledge to me), but I guess this applies to all S&amp;T common core courses.",
            "comment_teaching": "Math: Prof. Yan teaches in an interesting way. The topics chosen are quite interesting and easy to follow. However, the teaching is behind schedule a lot, and only half of the expected contents were taught.<br />Lifs: Prof. Chow basically forces people to interact with him and do discussions. His teaching is good or not really depends on your own point of view. For me, this style of teaching is fine.<br />Chem and Phys: Not much to be said. I did not attend much, and from my experience, the teaching is really what you have on an average course. They did not do anything wrong, but there were not any highlights either.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is 20% on each module, and a 20% on a project. The mean of each module is:<br />Math: around 55%<br />Lifs: around 50%<br />Phys: not provided<br />Chem: ~77%<br /> For details, some statistics are uploaded below. (The phys score is not provided)<br />My results are as follows:<br />Math: ~95%<br />Lifs: ~65%<br />Chem: ~95%<br />Phys: no statistics<br />Project: should be around middle compared to other groups<br />Grade: A+<br /> This shows that the A+ grade is attainable, and not too hard to do so. This is better compared to other SSC courses.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is fine. The is no need for attendance and no assignments and quizzes. The major workload is about the project. This workload varies in two aspects: the topic and your groupmates. For me, I chose an easy topic for myself (divisibility for a math major student) and my groupmates are good, so things are quite easy.",
