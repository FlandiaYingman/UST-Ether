Topics include the patterns of international trade, why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains from trade, without explicit policy interventions; the determinants and the implementations of different trade policies, the motives for countries or organizations to restrict or regulate international trade, and the welfare implications of those trade policies; the role of firms in the global economy, the operations of multinational enterprises, outsourcing, as well as the patterns and the determinants of foreign direct investment.",

I think the investment part will be taught in another course (4374). <br /><br />The course consists of two parts. Part I discusses the pattern of international trade, why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains from trade. Part II analyzes the motives for countries to implement policies that restrict international trade and the welfare implications of those trade policies.<br /><br />You should get the required textbook; Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, eleventh edition, Pearson Publisher. It will be very helpful for studying as he basically follows the textbook.",

Take the midterm rehearsal, for example, the real midterm roughly took 1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;hours, but he spent nearly 2 hours to rehearse. Quite a waste of time. Moreover, you will get distracted during exams (zoom), as he'll keep nagging. <br /><br />The TA is not helpful at all, but he is friendly and responsive. He has no idea how to explain the questions we ask, nor the assignments. He told us that he has no prior knowledge of this course, so we'd better ask the professor if we have questions.",

            "comment_content": "The content is pretty interesting if you are interested in International Trade. The professor always asked thought-provoking questions, such as there is a theory that there will be more trades between two countries if they are having a shorter distance, intuitively the effect should be lower in the modern day with the advanced technology and transportation. However, in reality, the effect is strengthening. She asked 3-4 these kind of questions per lesson, which I find quite interesting. Before Mid term, the content and concept is much harder, you MUST have a good understanding on the correlation between wage, price, labor: capital ratio. It sounds simple but the questions can be really tricky when she added different scenarios. The content after mid term is much easier. Mostly, it focuses on different trade instruments.",

Part I discusses the patterns of international trade, why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains from trade, without explicit policy interventions.<br />2. Part II analyzes the determinants and the implementations of different trade policies, the motives for countries or organizations to restrict or regulate international trade, and the welfare implications of those trade policies.",
            "comment_teaching": "Very good professor! One of the best that I've had in UST. She is very passionate and always willing to offer help. She welcomes students to arrange meetings with her to discuss the projects. For our group, she gave us a lot of useful advice and guided us on how to conduct research and do our project. After class, she always stays there for q&amp;a. She also arranged many sessions of career talk by her past students (although I didn't have time for most of the talks...). You can feel that she really cares for her students!",

            "comment_workload": "The workload is heavy. She assigned post-lecture assignments every week and gave a limited time to complete. If you do not focus in class, you wouldn't know how to do it. <br />The group project was fine. She gave us a lot of time to work on it. Only requires more time and effort before handing in the slides and the presentation day. Our group spent quite a lot of time working on the project before the deadline.<br />For the exams, I spent a lot of time reviewing and watching all the lecture videos. I think the exam itself is not that hard once you understand the concepts and carefully read the questions. The questions can be tricky. All open-book, so it's not that difficult as long as you have everything on your notes.",
