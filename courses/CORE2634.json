        "description": "This course will develop students' appreciation of various types of electronic music via an open, creative environment for its composition. We will explore the nature of sound and approaches to its organization -- listening deeply to music and the world\naround us -- and cover theory and practice in digital audio signal processing. Since we will be working with ‘concrete sound’, students need not have any prior \nexperience in music notation or composition to participate in the course. The course will culminate in an open concert-presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester.",
