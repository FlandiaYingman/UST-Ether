        "description": "Dance video is not simply recording a dance performance, but is an intermedia art genre taking the advantage of both video and dance elements to create a dance video artistically. Benefited by modern technology, dance video leads audiences to go beyond physical constrains, appreciating the movement in space with a different dimension, while dancers, choreographer and video makers could craft and capture movements and push the edge on artistic creation and expression. This intermedia art course aims at arousing students' interest in dance video through an inspiring and enjoyable experience. Students will learn the development of this intermedia art related to experiments with body and video. They will be guided to explore body movements and dance, while at the same time learning skills of shooting and editing to produce a video artwork. Students will work in a team and collaborate to produce a short dance video with their own cameras or smartphones. No prior experience in dance and video is required.",
