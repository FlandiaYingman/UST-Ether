            "comment_content": "The course content covering many topics and facts, but lack a focus or goal in my opinion. The professor uses powerpoints with maybe 60 pages with actual content in each pages, while actually most of them you don't have to really have to know (especially with no mid term and final). It is like watching a documentary programme on tv: you hear a bunch of (probably interesting) information, and then retain very little of it.<br /><br />Personally I am slightly disappointed. The course isn't very organised. Content is presented in a way that I can't learn much other than maybe broadening perspectives a bit. For some parts there are terminologies or logic that are quite confusing. A lot of facts are given, but it feels that not much guidance on analyzing and perspective. (For reference I am an engineering student so maybe I just don't get social science.) <br /><br />If you want to know more about some companies' policies to be more environmentally friendly or trends related to protecting the environment, it can be quite interesting. To be fair I enrolled because I am interested in environmentally friendly stuff and I kind of is satisfied. Simply that, I am not sure what I actually learned.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor is quite decent. Not the most intriguing lecturer, but absolutely not 'read off slides in monotonous tone' bad. Actually his voice is quite comfortable to listen to and his accent is quite clear. A good balance between non intrusive for people not paying attention while easy to follow for people who do want to listen. He will explain slides in details, give examples and key terms as well as being willing to answer questions in details.",
            "comment_grading": "I still is not quite sure what is counted towards the final grade. Though apparently the project (1 presentation and 2 reports) has the largest weighting. <br /><br />The problem lies in the grading presentation: peer grading is used. The actual calculation method isn't disclosed but I will say that adding up everyone's grades for your group and then getting a mean won't be far off. If you have confidence in your presentation skills and can squeeze a lot of content in a powerpoint, the grading method might be in your favor. <br /><br />B and B- for the two reports, one sd below mean for presentation. Got C for overall.",
            "comment_workload": "Quite light. <br /><br />No mid term nor final. <br /><br />Most workload comes from a group project that includes a 5 to 10 minute presentation, a report that turn the presentation into words, and an individual report based on what is done and simply adding some content according to a guideline. Both reports require 1000 words or less. <br /><br />Also have two or three assignments, each can be done in an hour or two or even less.",

However, it turns out to stress on the environment more. The ppt and content taught in class are not very clear and the assignments are sometimes hard to understand the logic. Maybe some concepts are quite recent so if you google them, you may not find too many supplemental materials. If you have learned some courses about the environment, you can take this course.",

Many assignments are not counted to the score and it's quite confusing whether doing them is good or not. The score largely depends on the group project and personal report. So if you choose a good topic, then you are very likely to do well. Our team has asked the lecturer about our topic and he said ok, but then after our presentation, he said our topic is off the point. So our group project is B-.<br />Not sure how many students got A range. I only got B and I regret taking the course.",
