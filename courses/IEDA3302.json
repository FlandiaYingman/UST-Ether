We wrote short python programs for each subsection and covered techniques such as graph search, data processing and visualization via dimension reduction, regression, clustering and classification. <br />The topics will be covered in the following sequence:<br />1. Foundations: Infrastructure and protocols of the web, sessions, security basics<br />2. Search: web as a graph, graph search basics, crawling basics<br />3. Visualization: simple interactive graphical informatics<br />4. Demand forecasting: Simple regression models, Bass diffusion model<br />5. Customer acquisition: Clustering, classification; [time permitting: Discrete choice models]",
