Described and provided us some insights on how HK has been performing in terms of monitoring air quality and the major sources of pollutants <br /><br />Middle part (Personally found this tested in the mid term more often)<br />4. talked about how different atmospheric motions affect the diffusion of air pollutants<br />5. Introduced various air quality modeling tools, and mentioned a bit more on Gaussian plume model&nbsp;&nbsp;(personally would say not super in-depth)<br /><br />Final<br />6. Control of different pollutants (like NOx, VOC, SO2...) But the prof has spent most of the time on teaching the control of PM (like collection efficiency of things like cyclones, applications of strokes law...)",

I find his sharing of his opinion on HK's air quality related policy-making very interesting, it was like from a view of the academics that I as a student has not been aware of.<br /><br />The professor is also super nice, again extremely willing to help you out if you have any problems with any teaching materials/ concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can meet with him/ find him after class and he will explain things to you in detail if he's available.",

(better if you have written some notes on it because at least one of the mc/TnF I remembered its something he has probably only mentioned in class) <br />2. and print ALL the homework questions + ANSWERS!! (and understand them at least to an application level)<br /><br />you should be fine for the exam, you may expect one or two questions not as commonly found in the hw, but at least in my exam, that question is not extremely challenging or to be considered as came out of nowhere.<br /><br />for the maths, only rudimentary level of calculus is needed, but some of the hw that involves proofing, I still find it quite challenging.<br /><br />others:<br />for the homework grading, as it covers 20% of the final grade, so try work for it <br />and for the final report, as the grade was never published, I have no idea.<br /><br />Grade: A-range",
            "comment_workload": "Actually, I would say it's not that bad, I'm a bit surprised to find the average of workload is C+ currently.<br />Around one problem set in one to two weeks time (probably after mid-term you may find it rather intense but the prof was willing to delay the deadline if the majority demanded it), but there are only around 3 to 4 questions. (It happens to me that the difficulty increases per assignment)<br /><br />For the final report, indeed it has to be submitted right before the exam, but I personally did not spend a lot of time on it (a deadline fighter).&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you have attended the classes and reread the notes about HK's situation, plus some online searching (quite a number of reports and news out there already), you will probably have a pretty clear idea of what could be written.<br /><br />I am also very glad that it has no compulsory literature to be read.",
