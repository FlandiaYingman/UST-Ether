            "comment_content": "Not a regular course. No exams. (Yay!)<br /><br />Robocon is an annual competition. You can read about it online.<br /><br />We recruit new members in the Fall term (be sure to check your email, or visit our webpage). The selection process begins with a workshop, followed by tutorials which are split into mechanical/hardware/software divisions. There would then be a small-scale competition between groups.<br /><br />In Spring, focus is shifted towards building robots, routing, and coding the robot. Junior members have the opportunity to become game-field members and experience all the action-packed fun and joy of endless practice.<br /><br />If you're a recluse like me, team-based work may seem intimidating. It's important to keep in mind that being part of the Robotics Team entails regular team communication, meetings, and the whole baggage. By joining the team, you'll get many opportunities to practice soft skills, ask questions, and learn new things. You'll also get to make new friends, meet people from other countries, understand society better, and make the world a better place.<br /><br />Taking part in robotics also allows you to apply skills you've learned before, ranging from a variety of math problems (trig, differential eqs, multivariable calc), physics (circular motion, torque), 3D-printing skills, debugging skills, and more.",
            "comment_teaching": "In the Fall semester, senior members will guide and provide tutorials to bring you up to speed. The tutorials tend to have a steep learning curve, but the seniors do their best to answer any questions and provide advice.<br /><br />For the software division, the tutorials would teach the C language, the primary language we use to programming robots. However, in Robocon, we also use C++ and Python for other tasks.<br /><br />Although tedious early on, it eases as we enter the Spring semester, where focus is put on the competition. In this period, further self-study, inquiring, and research is needed to understand the topics at hand, may it be robot construction, electronic circuits, or algorithms. It's nice in the sense that it's self-paced.",
            "comment_grading": "This course is graded from A-F. Generally, the extent of contribution, effort, and time spent correlates with good grades. There will be three peer reviews and one final report. However, the time spent working with the robots far outweighs the time spent writing the reviews and report.<br /><br />Regular attendance and contribution almost always guarantees A-range.",
            "comment_workload": "You can expect 3-15 hours per week on a regular school week. Exceptions are usually made for exams. In the summer (after finals and before the competition), expect to be in the lab for 9-12 hours per day. Expect to demo (present) ideas, constructions, robot motion, game flow, etc, depending on your exact role and tasks.<br /><br />Nobody will put a gun to your head and force you to come everyday and work; but once you get into the team, it becomes a responsibility.<br /><br />Pretty tough workload, I must say. But it builds character.™️<br /><br />On the flip side, you get to meat some rice lunchmates and people to hang out with (if you're into hanging out). Moreover, you get to keep funny/sweet/cute moments with the team. So the experience is quite worth it.",

            "comment_workload": "The workload is actually a lot since it is a huge robotics competition. You need to give your whole spring and summer semester here preparing the competition. However, if you are enthusiastic about robotics and enjoy the teamwork here, you won't really think the teamwork is too much. But of course, you have to be willing to give a lot of time to be here. But you would definitely gain a lot here if you are willing to spend time here.",
