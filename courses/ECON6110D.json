        "description": "The course is designed to introduce students to key contemporary concepts in environmental economics and equip them with the approaches in economics that are generally applied to analyze environmental problems and policies. The class will be divided into two parts. Part I will cover the ways in which markets fail to efficiently allocate resources in the presence of pollution along with the class of Pigouvian policies used to correct those failures. Part II will focus on the empirical techniques used by economists to assign monetary values to environmental costs and benefits.",
