        "description": "While pricing derivatives may be relatively accessible, derivatives trading, so critical to banks and some other financial institutions, is often overlooked. This course covers the main practical aspects of dynamic hedging starting with the reasons for hedging, the misconceptions, what it implies, how it is done for an option or a portfolio of options, what is hedged and what is not, the risks limitations as well as the inefficiencies brought by the real world. The course covers also many practical elements a derivative trader faces daily. Market risk and credit risk methodologies will be introduced too. The course is viewed mainly from an equity derivative angle.",
