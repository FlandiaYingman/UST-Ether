Attend each lecture and get all 5% attendance mark<br /><br />2. {MOST IMPORTANT} Do the practice qs he gives out before quizzes and finals and make sure you understand all of them. More than 5 Qs from each quiz and final are EXACTLY the same as practice questions (at least for my year).<br /><br />3. choose your groupmate wisely and try to score as much as possible in the three assignments. (TA this year is extremely lenient in terms of marking assignments)<br /><br />4. Be mindful in differentiating population and sample *throughout the entire course*. The whole course is about statistical inference, which is to obtain information of the population from the sample. Therefore, it is important not to confuse the notations (e.g. μ and x̄). You have to know when, how to use what formula, and why.<br /><br />5. Constantly put in effort throughout the semester, don't be a deadline fighter like me <br /><br />6.

            "comment_grading": "With regards to the university grading scheme, the grading is fair. It is, after all, a statistics course that teaches you about the normal distribution curve lol. However, my largest complaint is that the course tests your consistency (like how careless) more than your understanding of the material -- misreading even a single question will impact the grade you receive because of the insanely high mean. <br /><br />Quiz 1 was a replica of the sample quiz the professor provided, Quiz 2 was almost the same as the sample but with a few questions he answered in class (so stop skipping class after Quiz 1), and finals was more difficult and placed greater emphasis on testing your logical thinking and understanding of the course beyond the slides.<br /><br />Assessment Weights:<br />10% Homework<br />10% Participation (6% for reciting 6 times, 4% for not disturbing class)<br />45% Quizzes 1,2<br />35% Finals<br /><br />Exam Statistics:<br />Quiz 1 – Mean of 20.3/22, SD of 3.2<br />Quiz 2 – Mean of 17.4/23, SD of 4.7<br />Final – Mean of 25.1/35, SD of 5.9<br /><br />I received 21/22 for Quiz 1, 21/23 for Quiz 2, and 26/35 for Finals; participation was perfect and lost a few marks in homework, but still above mean. I think the mean of the final grade for the course is around 78% and I received 84.1%. That was a B.",

Just three assignments with about 5 to 6 questions each; professor gives a MCQ sample midterm/final and asks you to logically show how you arrived at your answer for some questions. He also provides the answer key to the samples, so no problem.<br /><br />No other BS like constructing spreadsheets was covered. Other professors had groupworks to construct an Excel sheet as assignments. But then, Excel is a pretty good skill, so if you want to learn, take the class of another professor.<br /><br />If you generally do well in exams, and can ensure that careless mistakes will be minimised, definitely take this class. However, for most other people, you will likely beat yourself up for getting a mistake in a question. There’s also the tendency to feel that your efforts aren’t rewarded due to the disproportion of the insanely high mean and your level of understanding/effort that you invested to revise the powerpoint.",

            "comment_workload": "There are around 20-25 pieces of homework which has to do with calculations and excel spreadsheet work and Kohei usually takes the best 6 so it is strongly encouraged that you max out the first 6 pieces of homework as they are relatively the easiest. After that, it just comes down to preparation for the midterms and finals. <br /><br />If you have not studied stats before, the course may be challenging as there are some advanced concepts towards the end, especially after the mid terms (Don't be fooled by the level of difficulty of the first midterm quiz!). <br /><br />Although, if you have prior stats knowledge, e.g. IB SL analysis and approaches, assuming that you have studied normal distribution in the past, you may be familiar with concepts up to the midterm but towards the finals the concepts will be slightly different and a bit more in depth such as T test, Z test, hypothesis testing, regression analysis. <br /><br />If you have taken more advanced stats courses in High school ie A level further math stats, IB HL applications, AP stats, etc.. there should be around an 80-90% course overlap so therefore, most of the course content should be relatively straightforward. However, bear in mind that towards the end the inferential statistics gets rather interesting and sophisticated.",

Before midterms and final, he would always provide us with some practice questions, which is really nice since I didn't get many chances to practice in my other enrolled courses. To answer questions arising from doing the practice, professor would always arrange a tutorial session on the night before the exams. I remembered some people kept asking the same questions which had already been explained before. If the same thing happens to my high school teacher, I think my high school teacher will be mad as hell. However, the professor just explained the same question again and again in an encouraging tone without any impatience, unbelievable! Frankly speaking, I think professor DU's course is so underrated. Although he speaks English with his unique accent, you will definitely get used to it after 2 or 3 classes. Professor would always explain the abstract concept in a very simple way by giving some concrete samples. For those who commented that they couldn't understand a thing, I think maybe it is because they didn't even try to listen to him in the first place. If you are a good student who always pays attention in class, no worries at all; what he said really make sense~",

The difficulty increased by A LOT after the mid-terms as they were about regression. Make sure you understand what is going on.",

Kawaguchi directly copies questions from his practice and pastes into the real mid-terms, so study a bit and it should pay off. Homeworks are easy as well as kawaguchi uses excel for teaching, follow the videos and his instructions and you are guranteed to get full marks. kawaguchi is known for his killer long questions in his finals, but due to the special circumstances this semester it was all MC, so the mean was much higher and much easier",

Most other ISOM2500 classes work on trivial business statistics such as sd, mean, bar charts, and so on, so in comparison, the material of our class is extremely difficult even without considering the R coding part. Since the professor it a Japanese, many of its contents are statistical concepts mainly focused by Japanese researchers. Also, the analysis we do in the assignments mainly focuses on social science and economics instead of actual business practice, and I guess this is because the professor is actually from the ECON department (not ISOM) and he used to teach at Hitotsubashi University (which focuses on social and economic studies) before he came to HKUST in 2017.",
            "comment_teaching": "The Japanese professor is nice but his heavy accent is a huge problem for understanding. Also, what he mainly do in class is reading his lecture notes and reciting what the textbook says. Yet, he is actually a nice person and is willing to answer your questions and is never impatient to repeat his answers several times. If you pay a lot of attention in class and ask him questions after class, you could probably understand his teaching (though I tried to and failed).",

Yet, the assignments have unreasonably high means (something around 9/10) and to my suspect, this is because the TA gives out very general scores. I spent a lot of time working on the assignments to get full marks, while some of my friends got 7s and 8s with answers randomly guessed. This is very unfair for students that actually worked hard on the assignments. <br /><br />As for the final exam, it is mainly about statistical concepts and quantitative reasoning. It consists of 3 parts: True or false (10%), calculations and formula proving (10%), and R code reading (10%). Strangely, the final exam had nothing to do with what we did in the assignments. The final exam is mainly derived from the lecture notes and it seems that the professor expects you to cram and memorize the everything from the 500 pages of powerpoints. Also, surprisingly, some of the questions on the final exam is exactly same as the ones on the mock exam, so it is unwise to skip the mock exam thinking that the actual exam will not have questions from the mock exam (which was exactly what I thought ugh).<br /><br />As for me, I got an average of 96.67% (58/60) for my assignments and the final exam is not released. Eventually, I got a B+ overall. (WTF)",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is unbelievably heavy if you have no basic knowledge of R coding (and I suppose over 90% of our class don't). We usually have an assignment every 2~3 weeks and typically I have to spend 6~8 hours on each assignment to achieve a 10 or 9.5 out or 10. I spent about 16~18 hours cramming the lecture notes before the final exam. The only good news is that the professor did not take attendance (though I suspect he will for his later on classes) and during the latter half of the semester, only about 25 students showed up for his class (full attendance should be somewhere around 80) (and yes I actually counted).",

            "comment_teaching": "Professor Kawaguchi is a super nice prof who would answer your questions and explain the concepts until you understand. You can easily reach him/Stacey through the Slack workspace he opened for the class. His approachable and humble character makes the class atmosphere lively!<br />He gave mock mid-terms and finals for us to practice the MCQs. Those exercise tests have explanations and answers so make sure you go through them at least once before the tests! (some MCQs (roughly 3-4 per test) are copied from the mock test 😏)<br />One thing to note is that Professor Kawaguchi's Japanese accent was quite strong, it could take about 3-4 lessons to have a better grasp of what he is saying... so make sure you know some Japanese (hiragana lol) and note the way how he pronounces some common words to help yourself follow his useful and chill teaching. For example... <br /><br />Putting stress on the second syllable: <br />paTURN -&gt; pattern<br />moDALE -&gt; model<br /><br />'k' -&gt; 'c'<br />suKAra -&gt; scalar<br /><br />'sym'/'s' -&gt; 'shi'<br />shimbol -&gt; symbol <br />shimmatric -&gt; symmetric<br />shingulu -&gt; single<br /><br />'age' -&gt; 'ji'<br />pAsentaji -&gt; percentage&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />'r' -&gt; 'l'<br />rike -&gt; like<br />onrine -&gt; online <br />raptop -&gt; laptop<br />recture -&gt; lecture<br />raBEL -&gt; level<br /><br />'f' -&gt; 'v' and 'th' <br />falue -&gt; value<br />fariable -&gt; variable<br />freshold -&gt; threshold <br /><br />Typical ones: <br />klum -&gt; column <br />huust -&gt; host <br />ofun -&gt; often <br />je-score -&gt; z-score <br />pikus -&gt; peaks<br />Gugu -&gt; Google<br />bugu -&gt; bag<br />wrist -&gt; list<br />aahfarege -&gt; average <br /><br />I don't mean to tease Professor Kawaguchi's accent.

He also liked drawing important graphs and writing examples on the classroom whiteboard.

For me the most difficult part is linear regression (Ch.8) but alas, due to insufficient time (i.e. less than 2 weeks) for teaching the last chapter before the final, I didn't have enough time to assimilate the concepts and ideas. I would suggest pre-studying the last chapter yourself.",

I like how he incorporates daily examples such as phenomenon in the stock market to explain the concepts and ideas. He is very willing to answer you questions and for local students you could ask him in canto as well. He is also quite lenient in terms of grading. The only thing is I could not find much pp or exercises from this professor so I just did pp and exercises by other professors.",

Tbh, even during the exam, I still didn't fully understand the concepts of linear regression but unfortunately there is a great proportion of questions that are testing your knowledge in linear regression. <br /><br />Assignment 1 13/13<br />Assignment 2 11/11<br />Assignment 3 26/28<br />Quiz 1 16/20<br />Quiz 2 19/20<br />Final exam -/40 (probably around 25 I guess) <br />All quizzes and exams (in form of MCs) are allowed to open-book but I don't think this would benefit you much even though this is the sole reason why I didn't revise much before the exam.",

            "comment_content": "I agree that this syllabus gives students who studied M1 an advantage in terms of workload, as topics such as probability, normal distribution, and confidence intervals, as they have already learned it. <br />However, the syllabus of the whole course for this Professor is relatively the easiest and shortest when compared to other professors in this semester, as it did not drill deep into more difficult topics such as the Simple Regression Model.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Kohei has a very heavy Japanese accent, and it can be difficult to catch his words in face-to-face lessons and even harder in zoom recordings. I think his explanations are quite clear for people with or without M1. His PowerPoint slides are mainly a summary from the book, so you can understand the course content by referring back to the book or search for videos on YouTube. However, sometimes he spent a lot of time talking about the proof of equations and rationale behind it, so his teaching speed is overall rather slow. <br />He also uses a software called &quot;Slack&quot; to communicate with his students and release course and exam materials. We can reach out to him and TA for any questions easily, which is very convenient.",
            "comment_grading": "The syllabus for each quiz is not too much. All quizzes are said to be cumulative, but in fact, there are not many questions on the tested chapters. For the two quizzes, they are comparatively easy as they are very similar to the sample paper they provided. So, the mean and median for each quiz are very high, and getting one MC wrong can cost you a lot. The final is relatively more difficult, so I would say the score of your finals can make a HUGE difference in terms of your final grade. I suggest getting sources (e.g. question bank) to prepare for exams, as there is a large chance the same question type would appear in the quizzes and exams<br /><br />Grading method:<br />Quiz 1 (15%): Mean 17.316&nbsp;&nbsp;SD 2.091 Median 18 Max 20 (Total 20 MCQ)<br />Quiz 2 (15%): Mean 18.338, SD 2.8 Median 19 Max 20 (Total 20 MCQ)<br />Final (40%): Mean 28.897, SD 5.925 Max 39<br />HWx6 (30%) (5% each)<br />*NO attendance mark<br /><br />For reference only:<br />Quiz 1 20 Quiz 2 19 Final 37 HW 30<br />Overall mark: 96.25%<br />Letter grade: A+",

As long as you score a full mark in 6 of the HW he gave out, you can already guarantee 30% of your course. Attendance is not counted and zoom recordings are provided.

My advice—attend them all.<br /><br />As for the assignments (3 in total), we were given an option to do them alone or form groups. Either way, they're not too bad as each one only has a few questions (around 6 to 7) and should be manageable if you paid attention in lectures.<br /><br />Quiz 1, Quiz 2 and Finals are all MC exams, with the quizzes being 20 questions each while the final exam has 40.

Some chapters in the textbook is not taught in the course, such as binomial distribution. Therefore, the textbook is not necessary.",

Aside from his accent, his teaching is flawless. He makes his own PowerPoints so you don't need to waste a few hundreds on buying the textbook. His explanations are very clearly and concise. He is even better than some of my high school teachers!<br /><br />Most importantly, he will upload exercise onto canvas before every exams. You can practice and get an idea of what types of question will appear in the test. He will also hold a tutorial before each exams so you can ask questions if you don't understand the course material. <br /><br />Swapping to his lecture is one of the best decision I've ever made.

For the 3 assignments and I get an average of 99.33. Attendance is easy marks so I get all 5%. Final score is 95.9 with the highest being 96.9.<br />Letter grade A+<br /><br />Here are some tips to get good grade:<br />1. For both midterms, remember to do the exercises given by Prof. Du. Redo them for a few times to make sure you understand all the content.<br />2. Review the ppts before exam. Make sure you understand all of the content taught during lecture. Some terms are kind of confusing so be careful when doing revision. For instance, sample and population.<br />3. Both midterms and the final exam are multiple choice so the overall difficulty is not too high, <br />4. Assignment is a groupwork so it is easy to get high mark. However, you can choose to not join any group and do it by yourself. There are just 7 or 8 questions per assignment so it's not difficult even if you don't have teammates. Just pay attention to the details in question, as some questions are quite tricky. If you have problems, just ask the TA or the prof. Try to score as high as you can.<br />5. Prof. Du only take attendance in 5 lectures and he will usually tell you in advance. Easy marks.<br />6. Although the 2 midterms is really easy(even homework is harder than midterms), the final exam is incredibly difficult. Just doing the exercises is far from enough. You need to have perfect understanding of everything taught in class, especially the part about Regression diagnosis. EVERY DETAIL IS IMPORTANT. EVERY SENTENCE IN THE PPT IS CRUCIAL. Review the lecture recording for at least once.<br />7. Cheat sheet(A4 size) is allowed in the midterms and final exam. Besides from formula, copying definition of some confusing terms can be helpful too.<br /><br />It is extremely hard to get A+ as only the top 2~3% can get an A+, which means that only 4~6 students can get A+. I think you need to score around 95 to get an A+.<br /><br />Getting in A range is not hard though, as the midterms and assignment is easy. Just put in effort and you can get a good grade. Effort always pay off.",

Also, he makes use of the whiteboard in his ipad which he writes everything down on it and it is good for you to write it down because it helps you enhance your understanding. However, there are some times when the screen display of the ipad has some connection problems. But it's not a big problem and it doesn't affect his teaching at all.

But if you aim high, you have to find past paper by yourself and I find them through Peter Gao and it may require more time for you to finish the exercises.",

There is usually a sample mock paper (not a compulsory assignment) provided the week before, and the lesson before the exam will be used to check it.<br /><br />Mr. Kawaguchi and the syllabus say that attendance is compulsory but he never actually takes the attendance. I see some people being absent but the attendance rate for his classes is usually high.<br /><br />We also use a platform called 'Slack workspace' (similar to Discord but we don't use it for calls) for asking questions publicly or anonymously, receiving announcements and slides, exam info, etc. He allows us to ask questions via this platform in lessons.",

The main purpose of the assignments is to <br />assess whether the students understand the concepts and can use excel to solve problems. Each <br />exercise has 5% point. For each student, I give scores based on the best 6 submissions if you submit more than 6 assignments. The deadline will be 1 week for each exercise.",

The earliest assignments are very simple Excel exercises about making charts and graphs with demonstration videos to follow, so full marks for the 30% assignment score can be easily claimed.<br /><br />The only shortcoming is that the skills of the earliest assignments (especially Excel-based ones) are not relevant to the course at all.",

It is not accumulated so you don't have to revise the stuff again.<br /><br />The bad thing is that all midterms and final are in mc format and you can't go back to the previous question once you proceed to the next question,1 question in a time which examines your time management as well, but you never know the coming questions are harder or easier as it is randomly distributed, very harsh. Some questions are like part abcde so if you don't know the first one then probably you'll screw up in the remaining questions. And it may based on the first part (i.e finding the mean) and the next question will be something related to the mean as well. <br /><br />Another thing is that the question types appeared in Practice Qs and Sample Qs are totally different from the one you see in the midterms and finals.",

It really helps consolidate your understanding and memory of the contents if you follow through the review<br /><br />Systematic practice resources<br />The format of the 4 homeworks is the same as the 2 quizzes and final exam. Before each quiz and exam, she uploads a practice quiz or exam. So in total, you could say there are 7 sets of whole paper to practice. If you do all these, check the answers and understand your mistake, you will definitely do well in the quizzes and exam<br /><br />I regret not filling the official lecturer evaluation at the end of the semester.

They are all so coherent in terms of format, which makes them really good for practice.<br /><br />Good written English but comparatively weak spoken English<br />When she writes email, her English is good that she is able to explain concepts in a clear manner.

His strong Japanese accent proved to be a source of entertainment for many during the first few lectures. You must be extremely attentive to understand what he is teaching. Apart from his spoken English, his teaching isn't too bad. He spends a lot of time explaining concepts that are harder to grasp and provides written examples on the board.

Won't be taught too in-depth overall. The lecture notes that Professor Hu is using are of GREAT quality. They are clear, easy to follow and good for self-study purpose (of course you have to listen to his explanation in class first to avoid confusion).",
            "comment_teaching": "Honestly, his English accent was not good and often stirred up confusion. HOWEVER, I adapted to his teaching style eventually and he actually is a very great lecturer. If you pay more attention in class, you will understand what he is saying. Of course, you can raise questions anytime during lecture and he will be very happy to address them. He will also reply to your email within a day (which is already quite fast amongst professors), usually within a few hours. All in all, he is an easy approaching person who you can talk to directly in Mandarin (he is a Taiwanese) if you feel more comfortable with the language.",

I am the perfect example of this case. I overlooked the whole last page in the first mid term and left all the questions there blank. And the system SAVED my life. My results:<br />mid term 1: 19/23 (mean: 18.6)<br />mid term 2: 25/25 (mean: 20.8)<br />final: 41/44 (mean: 28, SD: 7.04)<br />assignments: full marks<br />attendance: full marks<br />Got an A+ in the end.",

There are also 2 assignments (which were supposed to be 3), where you worked as a group of 3-4 people. I got assigned to be in a group of free-riders, but usually 1 assignment only takes you 1 day to completely finish, so no big deal anyway.",

Make sure you really understand the concepts and materials in-depth, so you won't be trapped in exams - try to score full marks for the first two exams (should not be difficult given you really mastered the concepts, but you should really be cautious to EVERY question - they equal 1%, remember).",

Pay more time on pre-study before lecture. <br />- Go browse Khan Academy if you don't really FULLY understand certain concepts (do so, a little understanding gap would mean a risk in losing marks in finals)<br /><br />To sum up, unlike ACCT / ECON, which required a lot of readings - this course focuses more on conceptual understanding, the lecture notes along are already ENOUGH (btw credits given to Prof for his efforts in making the notes concise and comprehensive).",

            "comment_content": "An introductory statistics course which fits into the ISOM department. Basically DSE M1 (or IB Maths HL topic 7 (option) - probability and statistics) or equivalent.<br /><br />Course Structure:<br /><br />Part 1: Data and Variation<br />Variance, correlation, standard deviation......<br />This part is a recap of what you've learnt in secondary school. You will understand this if you could enter HKUST.<br /><br />Part 2: Probability<br />Basic probability, joint, and conditional probability, random variables, covariance, normal quantile plot.....<br />An extension of part 1, but still quite easy and at this part of the course you can still chill and skip some lessons.<br /><br />Part 3: Inference<br />sampling, confidence interval, hypothesis testing.....<br />This part requires some deeper understanding about statistics. If you have not studied M1 in secondary school, attend all lectures and ask the professor when you don't understand. Part 3 is the most important part, as part 4 is built on the basics of part 3.<br /><br />Part 4: Linear Regression<br />residual plot, prediction interval, variation, time series....<br />This part requires some revision and full focus in lectures. If you skip lectures, you might get lost in the content. This part new to most students as it is not in the DSE M1 AND IB Maths HL syllabus.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is very nice as he will patiently answer all questions after class. He also jokes around sometimes and this makes him a very friendly and fun professor. He even took a photo with me after the final lesson I'm very touched! He recognizes me outside the lesson. Very friendly professor and very easy to approach.<br /><br />Despite many complaints about his accent, it is easy to get used to after a few lectures. It is not a problem at all after 3-4 lectures.<br /><br />Interactive teaching as he encourages in-class participation and there are 2 in-class games, which is pretty fun. Rumors say the games are a part of attendance but that was never made clear by neither the professor nor the TA.",

However the mean is quite high as part 1-3 in the syllabus is relatively easy. Here are some stats of the exams provided by the TA:<br />Quiz 1 (Out of 23 marks):<br />Mean: 20.80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD: 2.21<br />Quiz 2 (Out of 22 marks):<br />Mean: 18.56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD: 2.32<br />Final exam (Out of 35 marks):<br />Mean: 28.74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD: 3.627<br /><br />As you can observe in the stats, the mean dropped significantly in the finals. Part 4 is quite challenging and requires more revision. Therefore part 4 should be the spotlight of your revision, and it somehow decides if you will get an A, B or C. <br /><br />Personally, I got 89.x% (missed 0.x% in homework D:) and got a B. The grade cutoff of A range is 95%. The grade is only fair under a curved grading system.",

There are only 3 assignments throughout the whole course, which takes under an hour to finish each of them (even if you don't know how to do the homework it won't take over 3 hours). The length of each assignment is quite short. It is about showing steps and reasoning in finding the answers of the MCs in the practice quizzes/final.<br /><br />There are practice quizzes/final before each exam. But those are not compulsory to do so it doesn't count as high workload. Each practice quiz/final is exactly as long as an exam paper, so it doesn't take long to finish one also. <br /><br />Personally, I think the biggest workload in the course is copying cheat sheets before each exam. Cheat sheet is allowed, so everyone will try their best to copy everything in the syllabus down. Some even copy the whole practice quiz/final down on the cheet sheet LOL!

            "comment_content": "This is the first semester he switched from python to microsoft excel (finally). The course itself is based on a textbook and before the lesson begins, he assigns some pre-reading. But the order of teaching is unscrambled and if you have an e-book, you'll scroll a lot to find the chapter. (I'm not joking) <br />He makes powerpoints on his own including different animations in an attempt to explain the statistical concepts but frankly speaking, even if you paid attention in the lesson, you forget what the animations were about quite easily. <br />You will do a lot of in-class exercises using excel but at least in terms of excel, it's quite straightforward. <br />From section 3.3 onwards, the level of difficulty suddenly jumps and concepts are really hard to comprehend. (loads of formulas and etc.)",
            "comment_teaching": "Unless you have someone else to explain the concepts to you, it's really hard to follow. His explanation is really vague and even if you ask questions later - although it seems like he tries his best to answer to your questions - it's not much different. If you speak in Mandarin though, it seems like you can get better answers for your questions. <br />He often tries to interact with students by asking questions but if your session is full of quiet and shy people, it could be real uncomfortable to stay in the lecture. <br />In terms of Excel, he often shows his lack of understanding on how to use Excel. <br />In a nutshell, I think it's more or less a self taught subject and don't expect much from both TA and the professor himself.",

Midterm(30%): In-class midterm. Relatively easier but average is obviously mad high (12/14) since it's UST. <br />D. Final(35%): Noncumulative (thank god) BUT the level of difficulty jumps by 10000 feet from the midterm and even the prof is aware of this... Mean and median are roughly 50%. Some questions were badly sentenced that they were difficult to understand. <br /> <br />And the grading is very harsh as well. If you get over 80%, you can get a B. If you have any component that is below the mean, you can easily fall to a C-range.",

To be honest, I learned more from Khan Academy.",

I felt they were graded on the structure and design of the report, less than the content. Once I asked the professor for help on the report and he agreed on everything on the report but I still got below mean which is highly questionable. I compared the content with the highest graded report and it really doesn't differ much.",

The first few topics are easier but from estimation, HT and SLR, the level of difficulty shot up exponentially lol<br /><br />Anyway, I heard other ISOM2500 classes had to learn multiple linear regression and get it tested during finals.

Her teaching is clear and she likes using analogies to make things simpler and easier to understand. When she notices students have difficulties following, she repeats the topic the next week.<br /><br />Although there is 10% for class participation, PAN lets her students get these 10% by answering questions in class (you get a card that you submit by the end of class).

            "comment_teaching": "Professor Du's accent is hard to understand. It takes time to understand. I get used to it after a month. It is better for students to ask questions using Mandarin after lessons. However, some concepts are not well-explained. So it also takes time for students to self-study after lessons or before the exams. Notes will be distributed in lessons and also uploaded to canvas.<br />He is a nice teacher, who is willing to answer students' questions after lessons or through emails. Most importantly, he will purposely finish lessons 10-20 minutes earlier for students to ask questions. But for those who don't have questions to ask, it is good to have lunch earlier. In fact, the content of this course can be learnt through Youtube videos. So, skip lessons is perfectly ok. But barely in mind that there will be randomly attendance taking (totally 5 times-including 2 games played in classes). <br />The best thing of Prof. Du is that there will be practice question given to study exams. The practice questions are very similar to the real exams. So, by doing and fully understand the practice questions, it is enough to survive in exams. Detailed solutions will be uploaded to canvas.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is ok. Midterms and final exams are not difficult so the mean is high.

            "comment_content": "All professors have a similar syllabus, but Prof. Kris Pan's sessions are easier than the other professors', as she tends to skip all the parts she finds &quot;too difficult for year 1 students&quot;, while other professors may still cover those parts. Concepts such as standard deviation, variance, confidence interval and sample mean are highly favourable to students who have studied M1 in secondary school. Hypothesis testing about critical values and p-values is something new, but not difficult to understand as long as you practise more with the exercises in class and the homework questions. The most difficult topic, linear regression, was not assessed much in the final.",
            "comment_teaching": "Not much comment about the teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "Simply to say, it is extremely easy to get a B+, but if you want to get A range, it is not easy at all.<br /><br />Most of the students get a B+ in Kris Pan's session as her quizzes and exams are extremely easy with only straight-forward multiple choice questions. A one page, double-sided cheat sheet is allowed, so as long as you copy all the important information from the ppts on to the cheatsheet, you can easily score above 80%. However, since the scores of students are packed together, any careless mistake may cause you to follow below the mean, so make sure you do not get more than 3 questions wrong in any of the papers if you want to get at least a B+. <br /><br />The differentiating point between B+ and A range is during the final, where there are 3-5 questions you cannot directly find the answer or required concept from the ppts. In this case, it depends on whether you have been paying attention in class and have jogged down some points that the professor has mentioned but did not appear in the slides. <br /><br />I only got a B+ in the end and my total score for the whole course was 93/100. To get an A range you probably need to get 95/100, which means you need to get almost everything correct.",
            "comment_workload": "Aside from 2 midterm quizzes and a final, there are group homework sets every 2/3 weeks. The homework is not difficult, but be sure to proofread and check the answers for your group mates as well. Many times students divide the questions among the group and only focus on their own question, so there may be some errors as a result.",

Maybe it's his first time dealing so much with excel, some of his teachings are incorrect and you may need to search online or ask students who are good at computer and mathematics for clarification.<br />However, the skills are actually quite practial as it is very easy and useful using excel to analyse big data.",
            "comment_teaching": "You gotta have a good classmate for carrying you because he really couldn't explain the concepts clearly. Sometimes he is very impatient that he was so mean to my classmate once when asking him questions.<br />Also, don't expect anything from the TA. She couldn't explain the mistakes during paper checking.<br />You're on your own, unless you got a very good classmate helping you out.",

Just remember to complete new canvas assignments each lesson, even typing some random things will guarantee you a full participation mark.<br />He will not take attendance so just remember to check your canvas after each lesson even if you don't show up.<br /><br />Project 1 (full 65 / mean 60.6 / mine 65): <br />This project is about fat tail and underestimation of risk. If you understand the teaching materials and know how to use the excel functions, it can be completed within hours.<br />There's a bonus mark for the groups made on the good reports demonstration, which are the best projects. But I don't know if Prof Wan counted that in our total grade.<br /><br />Project 2 (full 65 / mean 60.4 / mine 59):<br />This project is about comparative statistics and inference in different markets. This project we didn't perform quite well is because we didn't put much time in doing it and we submitted it late. Again there's bonus marks for the best groups but don't know if he counted that.<br /><br />Mid term (full 30 / mean 25.1 / mine 30):<br />The mid term has only 15 MCQs, and it definitely based on your deep understanding about the meanings and usage of excel functions. Memorize the excel functions cause the exam may ask you to choose among 4 options of excel functions presentations.<br />Cheat sheet of 1 A4 double sided is allowed so remember to squeeze everything in the cheat sheet.<br />(Tip: It is very easy to cheat in the mid term so remember to choose your seat wisely. There is no seating plan arrangement so...)<br /><br />Final exam (full 41 / mean 22.9 / mine 22):<br />The exam has 41 MCQs and a cheat sheet of 2 A4 papers double sided (4 pages) is allowed. It will not cumulative so just understand the concepts after the mid term.<br />It is so hard to understand so make sure you get prepared.<br /><br />Final grade: A-<br />My classmate got same marks as me cause he is in the same groups with me for the 2 projects. We got the same marks in participation, mid term and final.<br />But I got A-, he got B+ so I don't know what the hell.",

Getting a big idea how some parameters will affect the final result and making sense to the result either through math or intuition(more recommended). If you have good sense of math but don't want to bother by doing those boring computation, come here. I am a lazy folk, and that's the reason why I was in his session.",
            "comment_teaching": "James is glad to answer any question and jokes around sometimes. As some slides are adopted from some advanced statistic courses(mostly PG courses), I would say going to the lecture and paying attention to his teaching will save you a lot of efforts. He even postponed the course to start from 9:15 in the morning every Friday. If you have hard time understanding why sth works, grab a look at other sessions' slides with more math there.",

            "comment_workload": "Five quizzes(5MC each) are more likely used to take attendance. He even gave answers to some problems, as missing one quiz out of four will lead to a drop in one subgrade. The mean will be super high for the quiz. Group assignments you can find standard answers in textbook or web. It's more about learning through hw. More computation and better sense of number are required in the final. But it's more about understanding, no need to memorize any formula or follow any pre-set process.",
