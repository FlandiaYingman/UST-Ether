        "description": "All human endeavors are constrained by limited knowledge â€“ about the laws of nature, external events in the past, present and future, how other people (including ourselves) are going to behave, etc. Life is filled with decision problems without perfect information of their consequences. In view of these, research on the decision making and strategic interaction under risk and uncertainty have been extremely active for the past few decades. This course aims to provide an introduction to this exciting field of research and suggestions for further exploration. The first part of the course is devoted to the economics of uncertainty and covers topics including the expected-utility model, market allocation of risks and asset pricing. The second part of the course is devoted to the economics of information and covers topics including moral hazard, mechanism design, and information aggregation in the market.",

Example-based<br /><br />=&gt; The course is more like example-based instead of proof-based.<br />=&gt; Don't expect to learn or to be tested about some crazy technical skill, like proving some properties of some principle or use some crazy maths like analysis or set theory to state a theory. <br />(TBH, you will not want to study these thing in the most concrete way, the maths is really crazy, which you can check from some commonly used textbooks on these subjects)<br /><br />2. You will learn the general picture to work on some simple problem in different fields. <br /><br />=&gt; Even it is 4999T, what you will learn is still quite over-simplified and not really practical (sad)<br />=&gt; Still, it provides the general picture really well, I think<br />=&gt; I subjectively believe this course is really great for someone who want to dig down in microeconomic theory in his future study",
            "comment_teaching": "// Comment<br /><br />1. No textbook needed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I will mention again in workload part, the contents are for pg-level usually, so, you won't need to read any extra materials just because they are all too hard for us, lol<br /><br />2. Teaching <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Example-based<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I repeated it so many time lol) Professor will introduce the concept, then use different simple examples to illustrate how to use that concept to solve something.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, actually, even I say &quot;simple examples&quot;, they are not really that simple, the problems just get simplified to a level that we can handle and get the idea, it is not THAT simple which everyone can understand and solve easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Style<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor really like saying &quot;la&quot; after every sentences, HongKongers should find his English quite familiar as it is exactly our style lol<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, actually, professor isn't come from Hong Kong, maybe it is from his experience in Singapore? I don't know. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other aspects, I think his teaching is great, he will spend time on explaining ideas and ensure his teaching is still ok to handle and not too technical. I have nothing more to comment as I never attend face-to-face lecture. So, I can't say anything about interaction or what, sad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Attain the lecture!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't try to master the course solely by reading yourself, unless you sure that you are born to be a genius micro-economist.",
            "comment_grading": "// Statistics (mean)<br /><br />Mid-Term: 73<br />Final: 76<br />Problem Set: Basically everyone will get full as long as you try to do it, so ignore it<br />Participation: don't know<br /><br />// My score<br /><br />Overall exactly mean, get a B+<br />I think it is overwhelmingly good grade",
            "comment_workload": "// Grading component <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;5% | Participation <br />15% | Problem Set x5<br />25% | Mid-Term<br />55% | Final Exam<br /><br />// Comment <br /><br />1. Problem Set<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Well, as long as you submitted it and you did some work, you can get full score.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Not really time-consuming even if you really want to do it seriously , and I think they are well-designed to consolidate your understanding<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;c. For practice, I basically do them all seriously, it took maybe 3 hours at most, per each.<br /><br />2. Mid-Term and Exam<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Difficulties: um, I personally found it quite harder than the assignments, still, It is not too hard. At least it is surely not the kind of exam that you can tell the professor want to f**k you up lol<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;b. With problem set: The style is similar with the problem set. So, do them seriously is nothing bad :)<br /><br />3. Workload<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;a. On the course itself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what the course itself covered, it is not too demanding. Since it is really example-based, you don't need to understand crazy symbols and study fancy mathematical derivation. Still, don't expect a easy time since the concept itself is still fairly hard even it is taught with some simplified examples. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, problem set can be done within reasonable amount of time and is surely doable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;b. On the content itself in the original state<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really want to study them in detail, like those maths, proof, and symbols of those principle and theorem, then, BE AWARE, the workload will be extremely heavy, at least for usual economic students. These contents (maths, proof, etc) are really supposed to be taught in postgraduate level. I believe anyone without maths background will find it too difficult<br /><br />// Summary<br /><br />I would suggest to every economic students who want to study something analytical! Just be sure that you are happy with dealing with maths :)",
