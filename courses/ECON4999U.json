        "description": "This course studies the process of economic development in China with emphasis on understanding economic reforms in mainland China since 1978. One goal of the course is to deepen understanding of various aspects of China’s development experience by examining in depth influential studies and reports on the Chinese economy. A second goal of the course is to gain insight into how empirical research in economics is conducted through rigorous application of economic theory and econometric methods to available data. Lectures will focus on in-depth analysis and discussion of specific issues related to China’s economic reform. Course readings will include recent academic articles, and students will be expected to complete readings ahead of lectures to facilitate comprehension and discussion.",

            "comment_content": "The course includes many aspects of China’s economic policy. The professor will assign an economic paper prior to the start of lecture, and the lecture entails explanation of the paper as well as other supplementary knowledge.<br /><br />Most of the topics seemed to glorify the shrewd economic policy of the Chinese government, while downplaying its unfavourable aspects. The arguments are supported by paper using Chinese sources.<br /><br />Institutions and Institutional Change<br />Why Didn’t China Industrialize Before the West?<br />Documentary: The Mao years<br />The Great Famine<br />Cultural Revolution<br />China’s Gradualist Reforms<br />Household Responsibility System<br />Rise and Fall of Township and Village Enterprises<br />The Problem of State-Owned Enterprises<br />Fiscal System and Decentralization<br />Financial System, Soft Budget Constraint, and Shadow Banking<br />International Trade<br />FDI in China<br />China’s Belt and Road Initiative<br />Economic Growth<br />Governance and Economic Development<br />Migration and Discrimination<br />Labor Markets<br />The Future of Jobs in China<br />Poverty and Inequality<br />Demography and Family Planning<br />Challenges of Population Aging",
            "comment_teaching": "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU LOVE THE CCP!<br /><br />The professor is VERY Pro-Beijing, and will kind of get upset if you don’t share his view. So make sure to get your political attitude right, especially when most of your classmates are mainlanders. <br /><br />The professor lectured in a very monatomic voice, so it’s easy to fall asleep. The lectures were recorded, but the professor REFUSED to upload these videos online without providing any justification.<br /><br />And then the TA suddenly decided to upload these videos 2 DAYS BEFORE THE MIDTERM, which means that if you want to revise, you are looking at 20 VIDEOS WITHIN 48 HOURS. Genius course administration here!<br /><br />The professor responded very slowly to students’ emails. Understandably, Professor PARK is a very busy person.",
            "comment_grading": "THE GRADING OF THIS COURSE IS A MYTH<br /><br />The professor didn’t release any of our scores throughout the semester, nor provide any rubric for any of the assignments. <br /><br />We didn’t review any feedback from the course except the final letter grade, so good luck if you want to gamble with your GPA. <br /><br />mid-term exam 35 percent, <br />research paper 35 percent, <br />in-class presentations 15% each.",
