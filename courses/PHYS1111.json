Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1111 employs an algebra-based approach. Students with knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1112 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton's laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. For students under the 4-year degree only. Students with a passing grade in any MATH courses coded between 1000 and 1600 need to seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in this course.",

            "comment_teaching": "Boring.<br /><br />His hong kong accent is atrocious, but barely understandable, so that is not a big issue. However, his lecturing is another matter entirely.<br /><br />Firstly, his lecture notes were very poorly prepared. Most slides either contained - (a) Brief explanations of concepts, which simply were not enough for comprehending the topics or (b) sample questions which were directly copied and pasted from the recommended textbooks. To be fair to the instructor, I did not attend most of the instructors as after the first few lectures, I simply was too bored to care. But self studying the powerpoint slides is simply not enough. The explanations were too brief + insufficient, and the examples did not help much with understanding. Moreover the questions were really different from the exam questions.<br /><br />As for the instructor, his delivery is flat, monotonous and puts students to sleep, which is not helped by the 9 am lessons (thanks ust). He just reads out the powerpoint slides flatly without much explanation, and any explanation he gives is just so boring that I don't even give a fck anymore. He simply does not arouse my interest in physics and makes what should be a fascinating area into something more boring than Chinese literature.<br /><br />For the TAs, I did not attend many of the tutorials they gave. One tutorial was just the TA showing a textbook questions, setting a 10 minute timer, and flatly reading out the answer after the 10 mins were up. From what I gathered, all other tutorials were similar so I did not attend any more of the boring tutorials.<br /><br />But the most atrocious thing about this course is the masteringphysics system, which is MANDATORY for all students in the course. The system is used for completing homework and finishing the online exams. To gain access, you must purchase a 400 HKD textbook which you will never use in your life again. Apart from the frankly unreasonable price I had to pay, the system was slow, buggy and froze in the middle of the exam (which costed me several precious minutes). I honestly don't know why the instructor couldn't just use the canvas quiz system (which runs way more smoothly) to post homework + conduct exams. Guess the instructor was too lazy to come up with his own hw questions and had to rely on questions from the publisher :\\<br /><br />Thank god I won’t be seeing him in next semesters physics course. Avoid this course if it is taught by Cheung",

Mine was taught by TA Wilson Lau, some of them were taught by TA James Seo. Actually, I don't think it is so useful as math1012 tutorials. During the lessons, we just kept solving some questions. And TA would walks around to see if we need any help while encounter those problems on our owns. Then he'd tell us the answers. Literally, we only talked about two questions in every lessons!
