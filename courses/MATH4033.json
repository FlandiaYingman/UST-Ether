Important theorems such as the generalized Stokes theorem will be taught.<br />Although some theorems in MATH 3033/3043 will be used, the prerequisite is not crucial. I would suggest interested people with background in linear algebra and multivariable calculus to sit/take the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Fong's lectures are really enjoyable as he provides enough explanation to all the materials and also tells a few jokes. Attending the lectures is necessary because it is extremely helpful in understanding the theorems and how to use them to solve problems. Some extra examples which cannot be found in the textbook will also be covered in the lectures. The lecture materials will all be uploaded.<br />The tutorial is usually carried out by the professor so the TA does not affect the teaching of the course.",
            "comment_grading": "10% presentation<br />30% midterm<br />60% final<br />The midterm is take home and the final is open book. For the presentation, each group of 2 presents one proof of a theorem/proposition/lemma in the textbook. One person presents and the other answers questions.<br />Everyone got at least B range (excluding the ones who cheated). The grading is very good considering most people performed poorly in the finals.<br />Weighted assignments are expected to reappear in future years considering this year's performance.",
            "comment_workload": "The main workload is to understand the course materials, so it varies a lot depending on ability of the person. Since the midterm and final are both open book, there is no need to memorize anything. There are no mandatory assignments this year, and the assignments should be do-able for people who have a decent understanding of the materials.",

            "comment_content": "There are 5 chapters in this course covering Regular Surface, Abstract Manifold, Tensors and Differential Forms, Generalised Stokes' Theorem and finally De Rham Cohomology. The content is very interesting. I believe this is the only real geometry course for undergraduate in Ust. The perquisite is Math 3043/3033 which is not needed actually, just linear algebra and multivariable calculus should be enough. Professor Fong say this MAY be the hardest undergraduate course in UST. Overall, this is a very good Geometry course. It is also a perquisite if you want to study Riemannian Geometry (seems to be opened by Frederick next year) and General Relativity.",
            "comment_teaching": "Frederick is a very good lecturer and the course is very well structured. He has his own lecture notes which is very good also. During the lectures he will derive things on his iPad. You can learn many things in every single lectures. I think this is a hard course but with the structured content and delivery of Frederick which make it more accessible. (Sometimes we have the situation other way round.)",

This year we have 3 people getting A range and all get at least b range (except one guy gives up the course get F) but compare to last year there are only three people getting b range and all the others get a range :)). According to Frederick, last year students do much better then us which I think is true maybe because the homework is optional so we become lazy.<br />This is also my first time to have take home midterm, I think take home exam is a very good way to evaluate one learning in the course. You can have a harder problem but with a much longer time to think about it because I do not think mathematics is a speed challenge or memorisation test and&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope more upper level math course will take this kind of exam because status also matters much to do math problem. But I also hope everyone going to take this course will obey the honour code strictly because this year we have one cheating.",
            "comment_workload": "Hw is not compulsory this year because it is the same as last year. But for me I do try most of them and I think making hw compulsory would be beneficial to the study. For the take home midterm, I personally spent whole week doing it overnight. To do not bad in this course the workload is not light but I guess you will enjoy it.",
