        "description": "This course will introduce students unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that are capable to operate remotely or autonomously in various environments. The knowledge of the mechanics of flight and the design of quadrotors and other types of UAVs will be explored. The topics will be covered include: introducing UAV and its subsystems, developing aviation models, analyzing flight controllers, designing dynamic navigation systems, and planning the operation in complex environments.",

However He has a thick accent and it is sometimes difficult to follow, making his lessons sometimes quite boring.<br /><br />I sometimes had the impression that his teachings were a bit unorganized (Maybe because he is new or inexperienced) as he would had added addition topics while teaching. He would go quite deep into topics like some matrix calculations so be prepared.",

There are two projects in this course, one group project and one individual project. The individual project required you to do your own research into a selected topic that is probably not covered in lessons. You will have to write a report of 6-10 pages and also do a 10mins (or maybe 15mins, I don't remember xd) presentation on your research topics. The group project&nbsp;&nbsp;required you to fly a UAV in UST and produce&nbsp;&nbsp;a beautiful video of 5-6 minutes with voice (e.g. music and so on) to demonstrate the technology capability of drones and skills of drone operation. Then you need to write a short report explaining what capabilities have been demonstrated in the video and at which parts.",

Both are group projects but if you are op enough you can make it an individual project.<br />Project 1 is based around flying a drone around ust and taking a video.<br />Project 2 is basically make your own drone and y33t it around a lab, so find yourself some friends. This also has a final presentation for your group to present the result of the drone built, e.g. how good is the control, how stable it is etc.<br /><br />for a year 3/4 course it has little workload, just need a lot of time for the projects.",
