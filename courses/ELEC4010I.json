        "description": "This course covers the basic theories and applications of language-based and interactive intelligent system using deep learning. Topics include distributional semantics with word embeddings, text classification, emotion recognition, sentiment analysis from text and speech, and language modeling, with neural networks and back-propagation, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We will also cover multi-linguality and multi-modality, end-to-end chatbots, and task-oriented dialogue systems. Students will learn about various natural language processing (NLP) tasks related to building interactive intelligent systems, how to design and build a deep learning model using PyTorch and Python, and the basics of software engineering. At the end of the course, students will work alone or in pairs to implement a deep learning model for various NLP research tasks, and describe their methods and results in a conference paper format. Successful groups will be able to submit their papers to an international conference.",

            "comment_content": "The prerequisites: This course requires COMP 2011 as the prerequisite, but it has nothing to do with C++. All of the assignments and the final project were done with Python and PyTorch, so it would be beneficial if you have experience in Python (and some commonly used library, e.g. numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn). If you did not code in Python before, you could also learn Python along with the course. You just need to spend some more time in assignment 1. As Python was very straightforward, it would not cause a problem in learning Python if you already know C++.<br /><br />The course content<br />Week 1: Introduction to Interactive Intelligent Systems; Empathetic Natural Language Processing<br />Week 2: Regression and Neural Network Architectures <br />Week 3: Training Neural Networks<br />Week 4: Sentiment Analysis; Representation Learning: Word Embeddings<br />Week 5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)<br />Week 6: Convolutional Neural Networks Applications; Language Modeling and HMM<br />Week 7: Language Modeling and Recurrent Neural Networks; Speech Recognition and NN4ASR<br />Week 8: Midterm Review and Final Project Overview<br />- Midterm -<br />Week 10: Task-oriented Dialog Systems and Semantic Decoding<br />Week 11: Midterm Questions Review<br />Week 12: Style Transfer; Sequence-to-Sequence and Attention<br />Week 13: Recent Trends in Interactive Intelligent Systems<br /><br />Note: Some lectures were swapped for seminars or guest lectures.<br /><br />Reminder: This course had an alternative course code “COMP 4901I”, which means you will be learning together with the computer science students. But I am not sure whether this course was graded separately or altogether.",
            "comment_teaching": "If you have read the review for COMP4901I on cwiki before, I would say I encountered none of those situation. Obviously, that review was quite biased, and more importantly, the course structure had changed quite a lot (from I have read).<br />Prof. FUNG’s teaching was quite nice, I had no problem following her teaching, and her teaching style was quite relaxing. The lecture notes were well prepared and organised, and I could see they had spent quite some effort to make the slides perfect. (I guessed they were prepared by the T.A.s?)<br />The T.A.s were very kind. In the tutorials, they would briefly talk about the coming assignment, to make sure you know what to do. They were willing help and happy to answer questions.",
            "comment_grading": "4x Assignments: 40% <br />1x Midterm Exam: 25% <br />1x Final Project: 25% <br />1x Class (iPRS) and tutorial participation: 10% <br /><br />The grading was actually very transparent. I received my scores and the overall statistics in all of the assignments, midterm, and even the final project. Sometimes there were anonymous score sheets attached, meaning that it was possible to know my position in the class, as well as how were others doing. Overall, I think I was in the top one-third of the class, in the assignments, midterm, and final project. I skipped quite a lot of classes and finally I got an A.<br /><br />Note: The midterm was quite easy, and the questions were similar, if not harder, to that in the iPRS. And, of course, it was a close-book exam.",
            "comment_workload": "The content of this course was not difficult, but the workload was quite demanding, I&nbsp;&nbsp;think it was mainly because of the assignments and final project. I would say this was out of my expectation for a 3-credit course. For each assignment, you will have to implement a new neural network architecture and write a short report for your implementation. There were two weeks for each assignment, and when the old assignment ended, a new assignment was published. After all the assignments, you still have to take care of the final project. This kind of continuous workload might be too harsh for some student. And as a result, I have seen that the marks were quite polarised in the later assignments: a few student just gave up in the assignments, i.e. did not submit anything, while some had very high marks. Thankfully, the last two assignments and the final project were delayed. Otherwise, I would not have enough time for programme and report neither.<br /><br />Note: If you had experience with neural networks and Python before, I do think this course would be not difficulty to you, it would just spend you some time.",
