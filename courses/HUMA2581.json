        "name": "China and Mainland Southeast Asia: Pre-Modern Historical Interactions",
        "description": "This course will provide students with a historical understanding of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) as essential background for interacting with Southeast Asians. It adopts an analytical approach that focuses on the political and economic relations between China and MSEA, especially the roles of trade, Chinese immigrants as merchants, technologists and labourers. It also elucidates the formation of MSEA states, their glorious history, the Chinese legacy in Vietnam and the indigenous adaption of Indian statecraft in Pagan, Angkor and Ayudhaya within a framework that enables students to grasp how pre-modern MSEA states evolved into the modern nations of Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand. Viewing the history of MSEA from the perspective of its relations with China highlights its uniqueness, while at the same time emphasising long-term interconnections. This approach eschews Sino-centric biases, and aids students in formulating balanced views of MSEA, both past and present.",
