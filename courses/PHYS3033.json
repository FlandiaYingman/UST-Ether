But don't be misled! They are very difficult because they involve a new language of expression - vector calculus. Plus, they are very conceptual, especially for the E-fields in matter and B-fields in matter, where confusing stuffs, like auxiliary field, electrical displacement, are introduced! For me, things I have learnt in PHYS 1114 are nearly useless. <br /><br />However, you don't have to be excellent in vector calculus, not, at least, in the MATH 2023, the multivariable calculus. The chapter 1 in the book contains all the essential maths you need to excel in this class.(I got a D in 2023, but it doesn't really affect how I use vector calculus.)",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching is pretty standard: lecture powerpoint, homework assignments plus tutorials. <br /><br />Dr. Rolf Lortz is a standard professor. What he teaches during lecture is useful if you have pre-read the textbook. It is understadable because the content of this course is too difficult that he cannot explain everything in detail for you; it is needed to read the books for detailed explanation. Personally I find the book more useful than his powerpoints. On the other hand, one of the things I like him very much is his teaching style: his teaching pace is very very slow so that you can fully absorb the course material without much stress. He can finish the designated topics for that week and leave few self-study weeks for exam preparation. Perhaps it is German way of life?<br /><br />The TAs, to be honest, are really bad. I doubt if they understand the course material themselves. However, if you are lucky enough to meet the instructional assistant, Chu Shek Kit, you can learn a lot from him. He understands EM in a profound manner and I often receive very clear explanations from him within few days after sending him emails.",

He gets a B+. <br /><br /> You can see that the distribution of A grade is quite strict. But it is a fair play.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say this course is all about how hardworking you are and how much you like physics. If you find physics interesting, or at least in EM, you will find the content interesting and acceptable. Since the course content is very difficult, you will find it extremely hard to follow the content in normal lecture days if you do not pre-read before the semester starts, especially if you are overloaded with other difficult courses at the same time. Plus, to understand the physics more clearly, you may want to do some problems in the books yourself, in my opinion.(In fact this is encouraged by the professor either.) So the workload is pretty high and you need to be hardworking.",

Really have to be fluent with multivariable calculus i.e. line, surface, volume integrals, divergence theorem, stokes theorem, taking curl and divergence of fields.<br /><br />Topics include electrostatics, fields in matter, magnetostatics, magnetic fields in matter, and electrodynamics with the focus mainly on Maxwell's equations.",
            "comment_teaching": "A standard way of teaching, going through powerpoints for each topic. Shows several examples of solving problems related to the topic, and just covering all the key concepts that's required.<br /><br />Though boring at times, explanations are adequate, but often requires students to revisit the topic through textbook in order to fully understand the concepts.",
