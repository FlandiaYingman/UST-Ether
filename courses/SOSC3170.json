        "description": "The persistent centrality of ethnicity in politics and social relations globally has confounded the expectations of “modernists”, who predicted that capitalism, socialism or some other system would put an end of ethnical identity. By some reckonings as well, the second half of the 20th Century and early 21st Century have proved to be an era of increasingly numerous and bloody ethnic conflicts. “Ethnic revival” is a feature of everyday life in societies spanning many cultures and levels of economic development. Academic interest in ethnicity has grown greatly. In this course, students will read and discuss theoretical contributions to the international discourse of ethnicity, drawn from the work of social scientists as well as works about the selected “case study” of ethnicity in China (including Hong Kong). Students will have the opportunity to make their own analytical contribution by presenting a paper on a topics of their choice related to ethnicity.",
