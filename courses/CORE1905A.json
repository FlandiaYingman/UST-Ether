        "description": "This course will help students adapt to university life through advising, sharing and discussion, and applying the science of well‐being to enhance their personal and interpersonal development. It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advices and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

I would like to say to those commentators, when your professor treats you unfairly, don't try to express your hate on any platform, don't try to seek for appeal, just fill the RR-12 form and go back 躺平<br /><br />=================================================<br /><br />A year-long science school course with 3 credit awarded in total (1 cred in fall and 2 cred in spring... but the workload in fall sem is way more than spring sem that don't even deserves that 1-2 credit span)<br /><br />Group A? Group B? IRE lads? Don't worry... 人人有份... THERE IS NO ESCAPE <br />(The only method to escape from this course is to fill RR-12 and forget about the $21050 tuition you gave HKUST)<br /><br />It is &quot;claimed&quot; that upon completion of this course, you will be able to do the following: <br /><br />1. Explain well-being, physical and mental, and its importance<br />2.Demonstrate a capacity to take care of personal wellness using a variety of theories, practices, and experiences <br />3. Develop sustainable habits promoting personal and interpersonal development and well-being while in University and beyond<br />4. Demonstrate self-awareness and a capacity to self-manage, set and pursue goals and respond to challenges and failure <br /><br />(Well, I believe over 90% of year 1 SSCI dudes are heavily suffering from this course. *nosebleed* )<br /><br />In the entire course duration, you will need to participate in:<br /><br />1. Approximately 12-14 seminar in both forms of physical lectures and zoom meeting<br />2. 2 community meetings per semester<br />3. Major selection talks<br /><br />Aside from Lumina Spark surveys and major talks, it's basically listening to professors' trash talk.",

This course spans the fall and spring semesters of your first year in UST. I'm writing this in November, so only the first part of this course will be covered.<br /><br />SEMINARS<br />Seminar 1: Introduction to CORE1905 Habits Mindsets and Wellness Course Requirements<br />Seminar 2: University- Why and What? (Academic advising)<br />Seminar 3: Introduction to New Common Core Framework<br />Seminar 4: Introduction to University Resources for your development<br />Seminar 5: Introduction to School’s Co-curricular Opportunities<br />Seminar 6: Science Majors Week (Except BIBU/DDP students)<br />I mean, the seminars are fine and occasionally entertaining. The main problem is they force you to attend all of them (attendance is taken) and if you are 5 miniutes late, you are regarded as being absent. Something to keep in mind while reading this review, is that the instructors of this course threaten you if you are absent in any seminars / acitivies in the course, you would &quot;fail this course and be disqualified from major selection&quot;, which I found extremely ridiculous and infuriating.<br /><br />MODULES<br />A total of 6 self-paced learning online modules, 4 out of them are required, and you must do two of them in Fall semester:<br />Module 1: The Science of Well being and Healthy Habits (Optional)<br />Module 3: Mindset 1: Personal Development (Compulsory)<br />Module 4: Mindset 2: Interpersonal Relations (Compulsory)<br />Basically they give you ~30min of videos to watch for each module, and you need to complete a quiz of ~12 multiple choice questions for each of them. To pass the course you must get 9 correct for each quiz. But most people just speedrun the quizzes - they provide the powerpoints, just read them and it'll be fine, since half of the questions are retarded.<br /><br />SELF-DIRECTED EXPERIENCE<br />You need to complete 15 hours for this part, which includes 3-6 hours of &quot;Wellness &amp; Personal Enrichment OR Community Engagement/Services&quot; and 9-12 hours of sports skill class. For the first part you will sometimes receive emails of certain talks with &quot;CORE1905-recognized&quot; labelled. Just afk the whole zoom talk and you can receive a few hours of record. For the sports skill class there are the following classes:<br /><br />1) Learn to Swim<br />2) Breast Stroke for Beginners<br />3) Front Crawl for Beginners<br />4) Archery for Beginners<br />5) Badminton for Beginners<br />6) Epee Fencing for Beginners<br />7) Foil Fencing for Beginners<br />8) Golf for Beginners<br />9) Karate for Beginners<br />10) Sport Climbing for Beginners<br />11) Squash for Beginners<br />12) Table-tennis for Beginners<br />13) Tennis for Beginners<br />14) Jazz for Beginners<br />15) Lyrical Dance for Beginners<br />16) Musical Theatre Dance for Beginners<br />17) Social Dancing for Beginners<br />18) Basketball for Beginners<br />19) Dodgeball for Beginners<br />20) Korfball for Beginners<br />21) Soccer for Beginners<br />22) Softball for Beginners<br />23) Tchoukball for Beginners<br />24) Volleyball for Beginners<br />25) Tai Chi Chuan for Beginners<br />26) Wing Chun for Beginners<br />27) Yoga for Beginners<br /><br />I can't give you preference for this one, but the Archery class I went was okay. In one semester one course includes 8 lessons, each 1.5 hours, which means you can miss two of the lessons if you have 6 hours of the first part of Self-directed Experience.<br /><br />COMMUNITY MEETINGS<br />A thing that I still don't know what is the point of it. You need to attend 2 of them in Fall. Basically ~20 poor fellows like you sitting in a classroom listening to the instructor 9up (not blaming him though, I don't feel like he wants to teach this kind of shit also), so maybe just treat it as a time to hea. I don't exactly remember what happened in the first meeting, but in the second one we were first asked to perform a mime (默劇) of a on9 story to the class and try to let them guess what it is, and then we were &quot;given a budget of $200 per head, plan an outing for the class&quot;. No idea what is the giveaway of the meetings, all seem pointless.<br /><br />In addition to all these you are required to:<br />1) Take an intake survey which asks more questions than the whole DSE combined (you need 30 min to complete the multiple-choice questions)<br />2) Take a Mood and Stress Assessment survey, on average everyone receive a result that they have moderate / severe degrees of depression and anxiety<br />3) Last but not least one 500-word &quot;reflective journal&quot; (attached see the essay requirements)",

As a year 1 ssci student, you haven't declared your major yet, so if you wanna overload, your request's sent to ssci instead of your department. You can't overload in fall anyway (as it should be your first semester in ust), but you also can't overload in spring, because the overload policy is supposedly much stricter than say, the math department.<br />that means that as a 3 credit course, it's pretty much guaranteed to block you from taking another 3 credit course. Well isn't that just exciting.<br /><br />2. failing the course<br />every single task of this course, big or small, are &quot;If you fail to attend the above session or be late, we are sorry to let you know that you will FAIL THIS COURSE and BE DISQUALIFIED FROM MAJOR DECLARATION.&quot; (from the reminder of the first seminar)<br />but if you think about it, it's probably not entirely true.<br />imagine if 100 students missed something. Maybe they were a minute late to a seminar, maybe they submitted the essay 10 minutes too late, whatever. According to their own stats, only 15 people had no major last year because they failed the prerequisite. Imagine if it's 115 this year. I think it's pretty safe to say that they won't let it happen, and the departments would get pretty mad at them if they do.<br />I do have some anecdotal evidence from someone I know: they forgot to attend a community meeting, but all they had to do was to complete another 500 word reflection in place of that, instead of failing the course outright.<br />oh, and they've changed the deadline of the 500 word essay from december 4th to december 31st. Hmm, I wonder why.<br />they don't want you to actually fail the course, but they do want you to complete all the requirements, which is why you might not fail the course even if you missed a requirement. Will you though? There's no way to know unless you test it yourself, and that's how they scaremonger you into completing the requirements.<br />from the other reviews, it seems like it's quite effective. The only problem is that it makes everyone despise the course.<br />So how do you stop people from skipping the seminars and stuff without causing (as much) hate? Just do what the other schools/ipo do: make it score based. Instead of spamming &quot;YOU WILL FAIL&quot;, make it so that people have to get 90/100 in order to pass. It works much better, judging from the reviews of core 1905BCDE.<br /><br />extra: different requirements<br />apparently seng people can upload a photo taken with people from a community meeting they've gone to to replace the 500 word essay.

This means that if you hated TOK you would probably hate the content, and if you found TOK interesting you'll find this interesting as well. You'll also be re-introduced to the type of bullsh*t you did for CAS. <br /><br />Content includes science of well-being, healthy habits, personal development, growth/fixed mindset, interpersonal relations, stress and stress management, happiness etc. <br /><br />Some people may like this course because it's basically free credits if you do all the (stupid) work. I still think it's frivolous.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teachers are comprised of random instructors(some of which you probably have as your instructors for your School of Science foundation courses) as well as SSCI administrators. They basically go over things like SSCI introduction, introducing Common Core framework, options for extracurriculars, etc. As far as I've seen, no one pays attention in these larger seminars because there's no need to. DO REMEMBER TO COMPLETE THE IPRS SURVEYS THEY GIVE YOU OR ELSE YOU'LL BE FURIOUSLY SENDING EMAILS TRYING TO CONFIRM YOUR ATTENDANCE TO THESE SEMINARS. Multiple times iPRS crashed on my phone and almost prevented me from completing the survey, so get iPRS set up and working before each seminar(if the instructors inform you that iPRS will be used). Teachers also teach community meetings where they do different icebreaking activities. <br /><br />If you're a local student and your English is not very good, the seminars in this course are taught in Cantonese as well",
            "comment_grading": "The fact that this course has quickly become one of UST's most negatively rated courses is probably due to this right here. <br />They really like to threaten you with the grading system for this course, which is extremely hypocritical to the name of this course about WELLNESS<br />Got less than 15 hours in for your self-directed experience because you missed more than 2 sports classes or failed to get at least 3 hours of other experience? FAIL<br />Got less than half the questions right in the modules on Canvas? FAIL<br />They couldn't find record of you attending one of their seminars? FAIL (unless you give a really good reason why you didn't attend)<br />Didn't attend your 2 community meetings? FAIL<br />Didn't attend one of the 5 core SSCI major seminars at majors week? FAIL<br />You did the surveys a day after the deadline? FAIL<br />And guess what happens if you fail? Not just it hurts your CGA, but you'll be BANNED from major declaration! I'm not trying to harass the people who organize this course, I just do not appreciate how passive aggressive the requirements sound.<br /><br />The worst part of this course is the fact that this course eats up your credits. A lot of classmates I know have complained that because of CORE1905A they are unable to enroll in classes that they actually want to take. This is a death knell for students who failed one or two courses in the Fall and can't apply for enough credit overload because of CORE1905A. What else they should do, wait until Year 2 and get a bad/unpopular major just because CORE1905A? Extremely infuriating",
            "comment_workload": "TL:DR: Super high workload for something that has no purpose to be this confusing and hard<br /><br />Fall term: <br />This course becomes an unnecessary pain in the ass if you don't finish the modules and surveys early. GET WHAT YOU CAN DONE IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS WHEN YOU JUST STARTED YOUR COURSES AND OTHER WORKLOAD IS LIGHT<br />In other words, get every project on Canvas that you can do finished during the first week of your term when you don't have other assignments to worry about; it will benefit you in the long run. <br />There's even a &quot;self-reflection&quot; essay that you have to complete; its due when the fall semester ends but I still recommend you finish it early(but only start doing it after you finish modules 1 and 4). The thing is no one gives a crap about the quality of this essay so don't worry about any contextual issues<br /><br />Besides completing the work, you also need to do 15 hours of self-directed experience(Sports skill classes, growth/development seminars, community service activities, etc) and some surveys(which can get pretty long and tedious). I did the Golf class; it was pretty good with an ok instructor, but the mere presence of having to do this especially when revising for exams can be very invasive in your time. <br /><br />NOTE FOR ALL WHO ARRIVE AT UST EARLY: Many New Student Orientation activities are &quot;CORE1905 Recognized&quot;. DO AT LEAST 3 HOURS OF THESE AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AGAIN<br /><br />Spring term: <br />Still a pain in the ass. Less of a pain in the Fall if you completed your self-directed experience and sports skill hours, but they still love to hurl random surveys and seminars at you<br /><br />You need to complete two more modules of some self-experience stuff, basically same type of content of that in the Fall, same grading system<br /><br />They cut back on the number of seminars to just 2, so that was a big improvement, but there are still surveys like the dumb Lumina Spark thingy that you have to complete<br /><br />This is where completing all the self-directed experience hours in the Fall really matters; you dont have to do this again in the Spring, otherwise get ready to attend useless activities all over again<br /><br />Don't get me started on the dumb Happiness project. They tried to make this semester's CORE1905A more appealing by introducing theme of &quot;happiness&quot;; well guess what it's just more pain to add. You have to make a physical art piece that reflects your &quot;happiness experience over the past 5 weeks&quot; and present it to the class in the last community meeting.
