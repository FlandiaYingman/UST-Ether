The course provides a platform for you to adapt to the new academic environment, build connections, and make the most out of the diverse set of academic and co-curricular opportunities that HKUST offers while maintaining a balanced university life. You will also be able to identify your personal academic interest, examine educational goals, and develop plans to meet objectives through academic advising and other personal development workshops and programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be supported by a designated Academic Affairs and Advising Counselor (AAAC) and Peer Mentor to guide you through the academic landscape.",

They will have some optional sessions talking the following topics as well:<br /><br />- Exchange and other overseas learning opportunities, internship, social/corporate projects, etc.<br />- Common Core Program<br />- Soft skills<br />- Major Selection<br /><br />If you are interested in any of those, you need to register for those optional talks in advance.",

Just like HLTH 1010, some people will fail the course due to the missing deadlines.",

As there are many small tasks to do, you may forget the deadline of some of the tasks.<br /><br />Your AAAC will announce the time slots to meet with him/her. Usually it will be a small group meeting. I registered the time slot that only I registered it and my AAAC asked me to re-arrange the time slot. :( It will last for an hour, discussing the university program, major requirements, school life etc. Nothing very special. You will get another advisor once you have a major.",
