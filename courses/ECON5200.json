        "description": "This course covers the basic theory of short run macroeconomics, as it has developed since Keynes. The basic framework will be the \"IS-LM\" equilibrium method, in which we analyze the major markets which affect the macroeconomy - labor, output, money and foreign exchange markets by studying positions of general equilibrium in them.
