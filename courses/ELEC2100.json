Some cheaters may say stuff like &quot;MATH1014/2011 is totally useless, I would not use them in the future&quot;. That's ridiculous. The key point of engineering math courses and fundamental courses is to turn the real life problems into familiar models. You may say the integration techniques are useless because we have wolfram alpha to do all the work, but wolfram alpha cannot model all sorts of complicated practical problems. You need to know how the concepts are used in engineering problems. (e.g. orthogonality, which carries different but similar meanings in this course, math 1014, math 2111) I recommend you guys watch the youtube videos of 3blue1brown, those are really high-quality shit, no matter you study cs, engineering, maths or physics.",

The online lectures are a bit boring, but it will be difficult for you to understand the topics just by reading the powerpoint, luckily the video can be sped up so it souldn't be a big problem. The TA hosting the tutorials explain the topics pretty well. Even if you are so busy that you didn't watch the lecture video, you are still strongly recommended to attend the tutorials.",

            "comment_content": "Elec 2100 is an introductory course for signal and system analysis, covering a broad range of topics related to the analysis and processing of signals. The course covers important concepts such as continuous- and discrete-time Fourier series and Fourier transform, Laplace Transform, and interactions between signals and linear time-invariant systems. The course also delves into the application of these concepts in communication and control systems. Overall, the content of the course is well-structured and provides a solid foundation for further studies in this field.",
            "comment_teaching": "The teaching quality of elec 2100 is generally good. The course is taught by experienced professors who are knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter. The lectures are well-organized, and the professors do a good job of explaining complex concepts in an understandable manner. The professors also make an effort to engage with students and encourage participation in class discussions. However, some students may find the pace of the course to be relatively fast, particularly if they are not familiar with the material.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading system for elec 2100 is fair and transparent. The course typically involves several assignments, quizzes, and exams throughout the semester, which are all graded fairly. The professors provide detailed feedback on assignments and exams, which helps students to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The grading criteria are clearly defined, which helps to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload for elec 2100 is moderate to high. The course involves a lot of material to cover, and students are expected to keep up with the pace of the lectures. Additionally, the course requires students to use MATLAB, which can be time-consuming for those who are not familiar with the software. However, the workload is manageable as long as students stay on top of their assignments and study regularly.",
