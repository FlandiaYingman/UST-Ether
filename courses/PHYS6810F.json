        "description": "Introduction to modern atomic physics with ultracold atoms and photons. The basic theoretical tools for atom optics and quantum optics will be introduced. Basic topics include atom-light interactions, cooling and trapping neutral and charged atoms and molecules, degenerate quantum gases, quantum manipulation and detection of atomic states, ultracold collisions and others which provide the foundations for contemporary research in AMO physics. Recent research works will be also covered including many-body states in optical lattices and synthetic topological states in ultracold atoms.",
