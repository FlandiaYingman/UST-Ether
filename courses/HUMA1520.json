        "description": "This course is a survey of the history of political, social, economic, and cultural changes in East Asia (mainly China and Japan, and to some extent, Korea) from the 1800s to the 1950s. In the past two centuries, the classical civilizations of East Asia met new challenges: the disintegration of old political systems, the growth of social tensions, and the arrival of an aggressive and expanding West. This course will study the internal and external tensions that undermined the traditional orders, compelling China, Japan, and Korea to seek new political and social reforms. Special attention will be given to the revolutionary changes in society, thought, culture, and the rise of a new political order in twentieth-century China, Japan, and Korea.",

            "comment_content": "The professor takes you through China's history. There is a brief introduction to how the nation was formed and its relationship with other Asia countries and the West. <br /><br />After giving you some background you take a deep dive into what happened in the 1800th hundred to the present. For students with no background in Chinese politics, history, and culture it is a very fun course to take. It can be considered heavy if you really want to learn every detail and causation between historic actors and events. However, by attending class and taking a few notes you will get the grasp of it.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is super knowledgeable and will happily answer your questions. He talks a lot in class so afterwards you may feel a bit overwhelmed by the information overload( good to take some notes so you remember the crucial parts). The medium of teaching varies ppt, simple talk, videos, photos, discussion.",

Ex. Your grandma might live through a war China had with some country. Interview her and get her perspective of it, along with gathering facts about it. Here you need to put in the effort to get a good grade( if that is important to you)",
