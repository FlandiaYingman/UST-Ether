        "description": "The Engineering Team Airship Competition allows students to explore various areas of engineering in order to design and build a remote controlled airship, culminating in the final competition before the end of the semester. Students will use these specific project requirements as an opportunity to explore activities in which managers/engineers of various disciplines are involved. Specifically, they will build an airship that uses helium balloons for lift, has motors and propellers for propulsion and control, and is controlled remotely using an Android device. The course is designed in a way to allow students without engineering background to have a fun hands-on experience, students from all schools are welcome.",

At the beginning, you will be assigned to a group of 4-5. Then, you will learn some fundamental knowledge of electronics and programming, so as to build and control the Airship. In the Final Demonstration, you will need to perform tasks like traveling past an obstacle, landing on the center of the target. <br /><br />As I mentioned before, this is an introductory course. Therefore, all the knowledge required will be covered in the Lectures.",
