            "comment_teaching": "Professor Lam is a very passionate lecturer and he is willing to interact with students and answer questions. His English is also very fluent and sometimes he talks too fast.<br /><br />However, I'm not a fan of his teaching style. Firstly, he makes extremely messy notes while teaching (which he acknowledges this problem lol). He would put many meaningless circles and lines across the slide he is explaining and turns the entire slide into a graffiti. It's very easy to get lost when you are trying to figure out which part of the slide he's teaching.<br /><br />Also, he sometimes spends excessive amount of time (eg. half an hour) to revise the last lecture's content. After realizing that, he would then skip through slides and explanations to catch up the teaching progress. <br /><br />I highly recommend taking Li Xin's session since her teaching is highly organized and well-explained.",

The project is a little bit time consuming since you need to program in assembly. The most time consuming part is debugging your assembly program, in which a single bug could take hours to find.<br /><br />Since this semester is online-mode and the exams are open notes, it saves so much time memorizing the lecture notes and relief the workload for quite a bit.",

Given the length of both papers, the time limit appears to be insufficient (the instructor announced to give 10 more minutes near the end of both exams)<br />2. quite a few of the questions are set based on scenarios with which we are not familiar, e.g. tracing an extended JK flip flop (essentially a JKJ flip flop) to find its truth table, a revised multiplication hardware based on combinational logic (not the same as the one in lecture notes), control signals for imaginary MIPS instructions, etc.<br />3. the above point essentially means the teaching team really wanted to test us more on understanding instead of memorisation (of course you still need to remember certain things...)<br /><br />In short, if you want to do well in exams, you have to understand comprehensively the concepts they taught (in a way that you can comprehend an entirely new scenario, not just those typical ones in the lecture notes), do fast and do very carefully.<br /><br />Each topic is equally important, but I would suggest you pay particular attention to the followings:<br />1. Combinational Logic and Sequential Logic: Some important aspects of these logics are not mentioned in the lecture, but the teaching team may still test you on them. Try to read other textbooks, not the one suggested in this course, to understand more.<br />2. IEEE-754 Floating Point Representation<br />3. Addressing Modes (especially PC-relative and Pseudo-direct) in MIPS instructions<br />4. ALU<br />5. Processor Control<br /><br />Statistics:<br />Midterm (30%): mean 63.27, sd 17<br />Final (40%): mean 65.13, sd 22<br /><br />My result:<br />Midterm: 65.5/100 (+ 0.1SD; I remember I couldn't understand one question on combinational logic even though I spent like 20 minutes to read it.

Also&nbsp;&nbsp;here you will deal with bit array all the time so before exam, I&nbsp;&nbsp;recommend you prepare some tricks to quickly manipulate powers of 2 e.g. \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^k = 2^{n}-1 (tho this actually comes from geometric series).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and MIPS Assembly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language : pretty interesting to learn Assembly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language, it lets you experience a new style of programming. Before exam, I recommend you to equip yourself with ability to read &amp; understand a block of MIPS code without any hint, you should be able to tell what the code is doing precisely. <br /><br />4. Computer Arithmetic : here you'll learn ALU and how to implement arithmetic like multiplication &amp; division with ALU. Before exam, I recommend you familiarize yourself with the every step of those algorithms including the states of the operands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />5. Processor and pipeline : here you learn to implement various MIPS instructions with hardware.

Memory System : we only learned up to directed mapped cache this semester.

I personally spent about 2-3 hours on that(except for a flow chart that required us to draw, which is really HUGE). Basically, you just copy and paste TA's skeleton and modify it just a little.(e.g., change 'up' to 'left')<br /><br />This semester, it's much difficult if you want to do the bonus work. TA left lots of useless codes(some of them are from 2012-2013, spotted in comments), and you do need to read through what they're trying to do. <br />YOU NEED SOME JAVA&amp;OOP BASIC TO DO BONUS!",

But this shouldn't be a problem if we resume F2F.<br /><br />I didn't go to Alex's lectures but I heard from my freinds that his teaching was decently good as well. Both instructors deserves an A for &quot;teaching&quot;.<br /><br />But the TAs, on the other hand, differs quite greatly. Initially we had IA Bing Yen who was very helpful and responsible. But later due to some unknown reasons (rumors say he was fired or whatever), he disappeared from the course. And not all the PG TAs were really helpful. One example is the TA responsible for the project, despite he offered an optional introduction tutorial for the project at the beginning, but he barely replies to any posts about the project on Piazza. It was Alex who responded to most questions on Piazza eventually, but shouldn't that be the TA's job? And also only a few PG TAs can speak proper English, most of them have a very strong accent.",

I got +1sd in the midterm and barely +0.7sd in the final, this was definately a B+ in the previous offerings in this course. I was already mentally ready for the B+ since I know I did really bad in the final exam, but was actually assigned an A- with an overall of 84.x%. Really lenient grading. It seems that Cindy is trying to make the grading of this course better and better each year.",

No tricky questions. Everything in the exam was covered in the lectures. If you review the materials thoroughly, you can probably score at least 80%. The only reasons you can have points deducted are either because you ran out of time (the exams were one-way-forward) or careless mistakes. Since you can't go back to previous questions in the exam, you may be tempted to triple-check your answers, but don't. You will end up running out of time.<br /><br />I recommend reserving 3 days for revision for the midterms and finals. Moreover, the exams were open-book, but only printed materials are allowed, so a good cheat sheet will help a lot.<br /><br />You can get up to 5 points from your project bonus. That's 5 points to the overall course grade, not the project grade, so it is totally worth it. You need to submit a proposal first, but there is no penalty if you can't finish what you propose or decide to work on something outside your proposal, so you can propose as many items as you want.
