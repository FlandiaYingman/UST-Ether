        "description": "The course focuses on developing students' ability to communicate life science knowledge to the general public through effective writing and speaking skills. In writing, students learn the specific skills to produce genres of both expository and persuasive nature, and reflect on how to explain life science concepts in an accessible manner without losing the scientific complexity. In speaking, students learn how to communicate life science notions and implications to nonexpert audiences using short videos and oral presentations with appropriate rhetorical and stylistic devices. For BCB, BISC and BIOT students only.",

Writing a 8 minutes-worth of script is already tiring, not to mention that you have to recite the whole thing to be fluent during the presentation. It's also easy to make a few slips or forget some of the scripts, which is my case. Do try not to panic and recover as soon as possible.<br /><br />WA: An op-ed article between 1000-1200 words on the topic you chose for SA2. So pick your topic carefully, otherwise you may have a hard time brainstorming what to write.<br /><br />In-class participation: The checkpoint tasks are just some short discussions, peer evaluations, and writing a few sentences on Canvas's discussion board.",
