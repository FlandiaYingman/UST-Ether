Hypothesis testing<br /><br />**Seems** identical to before, but he will add R language in this theoretical course.<br /><br />Note that YCW seems to have reordered the materials taught in 2411, 2421, and 3423, therefore he might have covered some materials in 2411/21 that is supposed to cover in 3423, and you will be at a loss. For me, I didn't take 2411 prior to this semester due to the time clash issues and take 2411 taught by another professor (which is also a disaster as 2411 is dictated by YCW), and I took 2431 instead of 2421 before, therefore sometimes I was like &quot;what the hell&quot; and sometimes I was like &quot;EXM, r u kidding? Wasn't this covered in 2431?&quot;<br /><br />You are advantaged if you take YCW's version of 2411 and 2421, he seems to have designed this.",
            "comment_teaching": "For those who don't speak Cantonese: his English sounds the same as Cantonese, and he will get stuck every one or two words and says &quot;ahh...&quot;. Moreover, since this course is online (during the pandemic), he teaches in an **empty** classroom with a poor Internet connection and masks on, which further blurs his voice. This makes his lectures almost impossible to comprehend. Moreover, his handwriting is not comprehensible either. Therefore, it's very difficult to pay attention all the time.<br /><br />His math is usually not very rigorous.<br /><br />But he intentionally leaves blanks in his &quot;colorful&quot; notes to force you to suffer his lectures, but still, only 1/3 of us comes. <br /><br />Unfortunately, Prof. Wong, who used to teach this course, seems to retire soon and she won't be teaching this course again, so I suspect that YCW will be teaching this course for the following semesters.",
            "comment_grading": "BAD AND TOTALLY OPAQUE<br />You will have 3 assignments in total, contributing to 35% of the grade.<br /><br />For the rest 65%, it's the worst part of the course, the final exam. First, we did not get enough exercise because of the small number of problems presented in either lectures, assignments, or tutorials. Second, he intentionally annoys you in every part of the exam. I believe that he is fanatic about R, and therefore, he makes u write and run R codes during the final, and he will give the data in IMAGE format, therefore, you have to key in each number but cannot do copy and paste! Some problems are unnecessarily tricky by making the parameters negative, and the others are confusing by themselves because I cannot understand what he wants or what it is about. I was disgusted after the final, literally.<br /><br />The letter grades are released without releasing the final grades. I guess he just looks at the papers and assigns a letter grade by intuition, because if I were a grader, conditioning on such a poorly designed and totally ungradable paper, I may have to do that.",
            "comment_workload": "3 poorly designed assignments, 4~5 questions each.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You need time to review what he talked about because it's hard to understand what he says.<br /><br />Lack of other forms of exercise makes us learn nothing, it's a WASTE of resources and time!",

All statistical techniques you need can mostly learn from other fundamental stat. courses, which are also most of the pre-requisites of other stat.-related courses. What appears in this course is just the proof or technique used to derive the materials in those 2 courses.<br /><br />Brief summary:<br />Part 1: Introduction (Basic knowledge will be used throughout this course)<br />- MGF, CLT, Multivariate normal distribution, Chi-square, t, F distribution &amp; related confidence intervals, Order statistics<br /><br />Part 2: Parameter Estimation (mostly focus on point estimation)<br />- Methods of finding estimators (MME, MLE), CRLB, requirements for the 'best' estimator: MVUE &amp; UMVUE<br /><br />Part 3: Hypothesis Testing <br />- introduction to H. test, Neyman-Pearson Lemma, UMP test, Likelihood ratio test, Pearson's goodness-of-fit test<br /><br />Exams are cumulative that the part 1 and the first half of part 2 are included in the midterm and the final mainly examines the remains. The understanding of concepts may be a difficulty but for the exams, they are just step-by-step stuff.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Wong is one of the good professors among the MATH department. She knows that this is a hard course for students (not for me) so she first suggested us to drop this course if you couldn't handle with what is taught in the add-drop period. Meanwhile, she demonstrated examples and explanations with details by hand-writing. I think this teaching strategy is more appropriate than just speaking with a monotone and powerpoints in a math course teaching proofs.<br />She is also kind for the students who want to ask for help. Just ask her if you can't understand the materials.<br /><br />However, the speed may be a little bit slow since she has to make sure we can all understand the examples and the concepts. Attendance somehow is needed because she will only upload the hand-writing notes to who attend the lectures, and you may not able to get the full picture just from the notes.",

            "comment_workload": "It is too much for me in this semester because the assignments are almost bi-weekly as well as the classwork. Maybe since I skipped rather many lectures, especially after the midterm, it always took me 2-3 nights to finish each assignment and prepare for the classwork. The exams also cost a lot of time to do the revision because each contains many formulae, procedures, theorems in the lecture notes. <br /><br />In addition, please remember that you will take this course, together with MATH 3033 Real Analysis, a &quot;hell&quot; for most of the MATH student, in the fall term of your 3rd year for the SF-track, so take care of your grades.",

            "comment_content": "Content上同往年差唔多，我覺得啲野都幾實用嘅。<br /><br />如果呢個Course只係你嘅Major Elective，我極度建議唔好讀。如果你真係好想學呢個Course嘅Content（我覺得係幾值得嘅），建議Audit/Sit堂就算，反正除左上堂都無乜Extra Teaching Materials。<br /><br />如果你避唔開呢個Course又想生存，我覺得下面係讀呢個Course嘅一啲必須Skill/可以溫返嘅野：<br />1. Math1013: Differentiation同Finding global maximum (MLE)<br />2. Math2411: Statistical Belief (如果係Ycw教嘅話），啫係有highest probability to obtain the observed data.<br />3. Math2421: <br />- 點樣計First/Second Population Moment (E(X), E(X^2)) (MME)<br />- Independent Random Variables嘅Property<br />- Sum of Independent Random Variables (MLE)<br />- 一啲基本公式，例如Var(aX) = a^2*Var(X)<br />4. Math2033/3033: 點樣用Theorem。某啲Theorem例如Slutsky's Lemma/Central Limit Theorem會不斷重複咁用，每次用都要寫返Condition先有分（例如Finite Second Moment for CLT）。<br />5. Math2111/2121: 要識Matrix Multiplication（Multivariate Delta Method）<br /><br />我覺得個Course最難嘅野係<br />1. 明白啲Notation代表啲乜，你要識得分開Theory同Practical（例如大X_bar係Theory果part出現，細X_bar係Practical先出現）<br />2. 知道啲Theorem做緊乜同埋點用（特別係Multivariate嘅Theorem），好多Theorem都唔要求個Proof。（PG Level野）<br />3. 哲學<br /><br />2411教嘅內容係應用（Practical），2421係理論（Theory），咁我覺得3423嘅定位就係將理論同應用Bridge埋。有讀過Ycw 2411嘅人多數都唔知自己讀緊乜（我就係其中一個），但經過呢個Course我覺得我明返好多野。<br /><br />P.S. MAEC嘅同學如果想Take呢個Course（Which我好唔建議），可以take左Econ3334先。個原因唔係在於內容有Overlap（最多就係Review同Preliminary內容有重複），而係因為3334都係個將理論同應用Bridge埋嘅Stat科，你會學到個Philosophy，咁學3423就會明白好多究竟做緊乜。<br /><br />我會講下我覺得個Course做緊乜野。<br /><br />假如而家有個Random Variable X係3423嘅學生嘅分數，我地目標係希望知道個RV嘅Distribution。而呢個Course assume左所有嘅RV都係一個Parametric Distribution，例如Normal，Binomial...呢啲有Parameter嘅Distribution。用Normal Distribution做例子，我地假如知道佢嘅mean，variance係咩就可以知道個PDF係乜野，啫係知道個RV嘅Distribution。咁所以而家個問題由Determine distribution of RV 簡化左做Determine the value of a parameter。<br /><br />如果我地手上有一Set Data，例如係30個學生嘅分數，我地可以點樣去估啲Parameter呢？我地相信每個學生嘅分數都係來自一個RV，Say X_i，總共就有30個RVs，佢地全部都係Independent同Identically Distributed to X嘅，叫做Random Copies of X。我地想運用我地Data去估返個Parameter出黎（Practical）。我地由Theory出發，試下用個Function將呢啲Random Copies transform做一個RV去估計個Parameter，呢個就叫做Estimator。常見例如係Sample Mean，個Function就係Take Average of the Random Copies。<br /><br />如果係Theory上證明左Sample Mean係一個好嘅Estimator去Guess個Parameter of Interest（例如mean），我地就可以apply落我地真實收集到嘅Data度（攞到Estimate），然後就可以估到個Distribution。例如我假設3423學生嘅分數Follow個Normal Distribution with variance 100，population mean唔知係幾多。我地就可以用Sample Mean呢個Estimator去估返population mean係幾多。假設我地收集返黎嘅Data有30個，Sample mean係20，我地就可以話3423學生嘅分數Very likely to follow N(20, 100)，攞到成個RV嘅Distribution。你都可以用其他嘅Estimator，例如我可以用最高分個Data黎估個population mean，我可以淨係用頭10個Data黎計Sample Mean去估population mean，但明顯地呢啲會無咁準。<br /><br />而呢個Course就不斷搵緊啲唔同嘅Estimators for different parameters of different parametric distributions，Study佢地嘅Property同Distribution（比較邊個會「準」啲），最後用返落Practical度。我覺得啲Topic都幾Fun嘅，特別係UMVUE，就係搵一個Unbiased而Variance又最細嘅Estimator。<br /><br />可能講得唔係幾好，但明白Theory同Practical嘅分別同埋佢地嘅關係我覺得係Master呢科嘅重點。",
            "comment_teaching": "其實上堂講得唔差，我覺得你有唔明去問佢都會答，有次上堂教埋功課點做，我諗功課唔識做都可以問佢。<br /><br />問題在於Practice太少，本身Ycw啲Course嘅Example已經少，今個Sem仲要少左一份Assignment（無左Hypothesis Testing，UMVUE，Bootstrapping嘅練習），無練習過就去考試真係難好多。<br /><br />另外F2F佢一係手寫一係派Hardcopy Handout，都有provide lecture video，好過2411啲古怪Notes。",

In the process, the student's feeling is not his consideration. <br /><br />First, he gives partial note, and give them after each class. If the point of partial notes is to make students take notes to focus, why give them after class? In addition, his note is a mixture of beautifully formatted, text typed, and handwritten parts. <br />Second, he (planed) to not release the recording. Luckily it is later changed. His point is that not giving recording is good for study. (which my foolish student brain can't reason why)&nbsp;&nbsp;To compensate for this, he keeps saying we can ask him questions as others wrote. But he seems to ignore that one could ask nothing if one is confused.<br />Third, but not least. He requires each homework to have a 10min&nbsp;&nbsp;recorded presentation to explain your answer.

Although I knew I did well on the final, I have no idea how well I did in comparison to the rest of the class. Total mystery.<br /><br />Without a midterm, the course grade was determined entirely by the performance in the final, since everyone gets full marks in the assignments (except for those that didn't hand it in). Thus, the fact that YCW didn't release the results for the final makes it impossible to judge how lenient or strict he is.",

As such, the overall workload is minimal if you have source, and I barely studied until the day before the final.<br /><br />The final exam was quite mechanical and the types of questions are quite standard, e.g. finding the confidence interval for a given estimator, or applying the LRT test. We were allowed to bring one double-sided cheat sheet to the exam, so you don't really need to memorize anything. There was a couple of slightly tricky question that involved the gamma distribution and its shape and rate parameters, so make sure you write all the probability distributions on your cheat sheet.",

I think it's because the statistics stuffs are less trivial to me compare to linear algebra or matrix stuffs.<br /><br />Grading turns out to be pretty fair. <br />If you really know all the points he mentioned, you could get most of the exam questions correct. Definitely an A range. <br />If you could know 70%~80% of the content, I think you could still get 40-60% of the questions in the exam, so probably a B range. <br />If you only know 50% of the content, then I would say you would probably fuck up in the exam and could only answer 1 to 2 questions.
