        "name": "Fluid Flow and Heat/Mass Transfer in Sustainability Applications",
        "description": "To illustrate fundamental principles of flow fluid and heat/mass transfer through real-world applications. The course will teach the use of commercially-available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software as a primary mean for analysis and visualization. This course will cover the necessary steps of setting up CFD models and the important aspects of each step. The steps include domain selection, geometry, discretization and mesh sensitivity, boundary conditions, solver, and post-processing. The students can expect to be capable of formulating simple to immediate level fluid-flow problem and be able to use the software to solve without any assistance. This will build the foundation for pursuing more complex problem. Sample applications include outdoor wind environment, indoor ventilation, thermal comfort, natural ventilation, duct flow, and pollution dispersion. This course allows the students to evaluate the quality of CFD studies. In addition, this course intends to help students to develop critical thinking and solve industrial problems.",
