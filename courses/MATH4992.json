I have put enormous efforts in this FYP (preparation, coding, generating desired results, LATEX...) and those HW assignments. <br /><br />What I want to say is, what extent of this FYP workload depends on yours attitude, you can be pretty free if you pay cursory attention to this course and do not need a good enough grade.<br /><br />Due to putting too much time on this FYP, I have little time to prepare the final exam of other courses (This is a very BAD EXPERIENCE for me !!!! ). Please try your best to balance your time.
