        "description": "Based on single-country and cross-national research, this course includes some issues concerning democracy and democratization around the world. It will start with helping students understand the debates on the definitions of democracy and explore their implications. The course will then examine empirically the consequences of democracy and thereby debate on the alleged strengths and weaknesses of democracy. The course will also introduce the global expansion of democracies since the late twentieth century. It will analyze the causes of global democratization from various perspectives. Lastly, it will examine the factors shaping democratic stability from various approaches.",

            "comment_content": "First two weeks are lectures on the trend of democratization around the world and the strengths and weaknesses of democracy. The remaining weeks are student presentations plus student-led seminars on different topics about democracy and democratization, including elite-choice approach, modernization theory, civil society, political culture, parliamentary vs presidential democracy, Asian values and authoritarian regimes.<br /><br />I really think times that we can discuss openly and freely on such topics would only shrink further in the future due to the implementation of the National Security Law. Hong Kong has been escalating into a real authoritarian place and becoming less and less different than China. In UST, social sciences and humanities are not valued much compared to other higher education institutes in HK. So... such courses might become history and please treasure the times that you can discuss topics like that.",
            "comment_teaching": "For the professor's lectures, he provided quite a lot of information on different topics about democracy and democratization, with a focus on contemporary issues and problems. For this semester's class discussions, I felt that he interfered quite a lot and probably he should allow more time for students to raise and answer questions. Some technical problems from his devices as well I think.<br /><br />But since this is the last semester that he is teaching in UST (he told us that in the last lesson), I would say he has left some really good lessons to us. In the last moments of the last lesson he talked about not giving up the values we believed in and doing our best to uphold them in these turbulent times, when we witness threats to democracy around the world (including advanced states) and how HK has been up to... well, we all know that. So, best of luck to Prof. Sing!",

            "comment_workload": "For the presentation you have to prepare quite a lot, not just the assigned readings but also beyond that as well. And be prepared to receive some really sharp questions from other classmates.<br /><br />For the paper, you have two weeks time after your presentation. I would say that just using the materials you had prepared for the presentation is not enough: you still need to do some additional research. But then from my experience just one week's time is already enough.<br /><br />For the class participation, you need to listen to the presentations quite carefully in order to spot out some areas that you would like to raise questions on during the discussion. You also need to be aware of some current affairs as well. If you are someone enthusiastic in politics, you will find it really enjoyable.<br /><br />But overall, except that the preparation for the presentation is really intense, the workload for other stuff is quite small.",
