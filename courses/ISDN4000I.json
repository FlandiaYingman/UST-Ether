        "description": "The special topic course provides an introductory experience into the design of mechatronic systems and the corresponding controller using embedded computing platform. The course includes fundamental theory and also practical hands-on labs and projects for the student to acquire the basic knowledge of designing mechatronic systems. In the lab sessions, students design and build a succession of mechatronic subsystems, leading to an integrated system in a final project. Lectures topics include embedded system design, basic electronics, use of sensors and actuators, system modelling, measurement and control, and appreciation of how mechatronic systems solve real-world problems. Instructor's approval is required.",
