            "comment_content": "Basically this course is introduction to physical and analytical chemistry(CHEM 1030,2311,2410). This course aimed to provide students a science background for their research/ FYP. Fundamental knowledge in chemistry is recommended before taking this course, CIVL2410 is not a hard prerequisite since technical part is barely covered. <br /><br />The topics should more or less same in every semester, they are pretty standard and you can go goggling for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />1. Introduction <br />2. Chemical kinetics<br />3. Chemical equilibrium<br />4. Acids/bases<br />5. Colloid chemistry<br />6. Solubility and precipitation<br />7. Redox Reactions<br /><br />I take this course as a CIEV elective and I think the content is not hard to understand, since I am OK in chemistry. Also, the content is good enough for students to understand/evaluate the techniques for water treatment processes.<br /><br />Moreover, this semester is in online delivery mode due to the pandemic so the comments may not be accurate enough.",
            "comment_teaching": "The PowerPoint slides are easy to read and go through (I think they are complementary ones from the textbook). The instructor is enthusiastic but not energetic. Although he can explain the concepts quite well, but it is easy to fall asleep with his flat tone. . During the lectures, he will ask some questions as to take attendance. Comparatively, his teaching is better than 4430 I think.<br /><br />The lecture is 3 hours long per week and it is conducted at night to fit the schedule of RPG students (7-10 pm this year), and a short break will be provided between.2/3 are RPG and the rest are UG students.",
            "comment_grading": "Professor said that mean grades will turn out a B+/A-, normal for PG courses and of course lenient for UG students<br /><br />Grading scheme:<br />5% attendance<br />10% homework, full mark for submission <br />40% midterm (cancelled this semester)<br />45% final (85% this semester with the cancellation of midterm)<br />I screw up my final since I miss 10 pts out of 100 <br />Finally B, so good grade!<br /> <br />Please be remind that to write down all the things he said in the lecture or else you will have a miserable life like me",
