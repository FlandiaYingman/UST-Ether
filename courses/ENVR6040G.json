        "description": "The large-scale circulation in the atmosphere-ocean system is maintained by small scale turbulent motions that interact with large scale radiative processes. This class introduces the basic theories of large-scale atmosphere-ocean flows and of small-scale turbulent motions, including rotation and stratification, vorticity and potential vorticity, and scaling and approximations. This course also provides the presentation of mesoscale storms, in tropical and mid-latitude circulations, and in the dynamics of climate. This course is an accessible for students that require the foundation for advanced study in meteorology, oceanography, atmospheric and climate sciences.",
