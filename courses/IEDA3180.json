        "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

            "comment_content": "This course is essentially an easier version of his MAFS course on portfolio optimization (you can check his website for lecture slides if you're interested). This course mostly focuses on convex optimization in portfolio optimization, they cover things like:<br />- Markowitz's mean-variance analysis<br />- time series modelling of financial data<br />- optimization algorithms (e.g. interior point methods, Newton's method)<br />- index tracking via MM<br />- risk parity portfolio via Newton, BCD, and SCA<br />- portfolio optimization with alternative risk measures (e.g. CVaR, CDaR)<br />- robust portfolio optimization<br /><br />Overall the topics covered are really interesting imo but they require some foundation or at least basic understanding of convex optimization and linear algebra to really appreciate.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Palomar is a funny guy, he's always making random jokes/remarks during lectures and his lectures are quite compelling. All the lecture materials are very well prepared which is really nice considering materials related to these topics often aren't very accessible.",
            "comment_grading": "Good grading, the homework and midterm will make up a large part of the grade (can't remember how much) and you can get bonus marks in the assignments (something like an extra 50 points out of 100 for some of the assignments). Full marks for all of the homework + midterm and a mediocre final project should get you at least an A.",
            "comment_workload": "Workload is fairly light imo; there were 3 homework assignments which involved implementing some stuff in python. There was a take home midterm which was similar to the homework assignments but took a bit longer to complete, and there was a final project that involved doing some empirical testing on a portfolio allocation method of our choice and in the end we had to do an 8 minute presentation.<br /><br />All in all, the assignments were all quite enjoyable and not too difficult. However, if you're not familiar with programming and have a weak foundation in linear algebra, you will definitely struggle in this course.",
