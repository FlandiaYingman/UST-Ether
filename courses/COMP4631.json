If you want to learn new stuffs, go for shuai's version of COMP 3632 (that's a good one!). <br /><br />The first part of the course is mostly math tools and ciphers. Basically, he repeats all the discrete math stuff from MATH 2711. I don't think there is any new content, maybe keyed hash functions and modes of operation? Feel free to comment if you find sth new.<br /><br />The second part is just explaining security protocols one by one. Unix, windows NT, kerberos, ssh, ipsec, ssl, ...... Lots of uninteresting details that probably would not be useful.",
            "comment_teaching": "He explains things clearly. He spend quite a lot of time to go through the details and make things clear. Also, he tries to ask questions to make sure we understand the content.<br /><br />However, no one bothers to answer his questions (or even bother to listen to his lectures) due to his tone. I don't know why. His voice just makes me feel bored.",
            "comment_grading": "Most people get 9X% score in the three assignments, so the grading is mostly based on the final exam. AND THE FINAL EXAM ONLY CONSISTS OF NINE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS. The conceptual questions are very tricky. For the factual questions, the content even have been mentioned briefly (or have not been mentioned?) in the lecture. This is a completely inaccurate reflection of the students' ability. <br /><br />I misread a word in a tricky question and got fxxked up in the factual questions, resulting only 5/9. <br /><br />My score:<br />Assignment (45%): 299/300<br />Final (55%): 5/9<br />Final grade: A-<br /><br />Grade distribution:<br />A+: 1<br />A: 2<br />A-: 2<br />Total A-range: 5<br />B+: 7<br />B: 2<br />B-: 0<br />Total B-range: 9<br />C+: 3<br />Total C-range: 3<br />No D/Fs<br /><br />Basically the grading curve is nice but the assessment scheme is problematic.",
            "comment_workload": "This course has the least workload among all UST course. The course only consists of 3 written assignments and an open-book exam.<br /><br />For the 3 assignments, you can find the answers of most (if not all) questions from past homework. Your job is basically try to understand the answer and do paraphrasing.<br /><br />The exam only consists of 9 MC questions and it is open-book. I think revision would not help you much unless you try to rewatch every lecture video and mark down all of the details (which is mission impossible).",
