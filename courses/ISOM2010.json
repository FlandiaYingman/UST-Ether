Details of percentage in every part plz look at other review because I am too lazy to look at syllabus.<br /><br />Both questions in lecture midterm and final are too easy, only 15 questions at most, it's very hard to distinguish students ability and learning outcome. Differences in good grade and bad grade are just whether you study or if you are careless. Very easy to get above mean.<br /><br />For project and presentation, he gives almost everyone same score in two sections, doesn't distinguish students apart in your project score even if you work very hard, still get same score as those who work only median.<br /><br />For 3 reading assignments, I guess everyone can get full score, unless you forget to submit.<br /><br />As for the lab part, don't miss weekly quiz and you can get full score. Lab final is quite median, even though I don't have any VBA background and skip almost half of the lab classes, just study before final, watch lab recordings, and you can get mean in final.<br /><br />For me, I got above mean 1...sd almost full score in both lecture midterm and final, almost full score in project presentation and report, full score in reading assignments, full score in lab quiz, mean in lab final, little above mean in participation part. <br /><br />Nothing below mean but ended up in C+.

And Tat Koon will grade your review as a part of participation. He said nobody gets full score in this part but No one knows his standards???<br /><br />Just revise your ppt before midterm and final, actually exams aren't heavy workload in this course.<br /><br />3 reading assignments are all asking about to what extent do you agree with the idea, or do you agree with the concept, only some ticks or choose 1~10, you can finish in less than 5 minutes without reading the article.",

Lessons were boring and I often left the Zoom class mid-way as I was falling asleep. As it was an online semester, I planned to re-watch lecture videos in 1.5 speed but couldn't due to her accent. The TAs are even worse, especially Samuel Lai, who comes off as arrogant and is unresponsive when it comes to emails about midterms or exam scores. He also intentionally emphasizes his Hong Kong accent in his lab videos. Weird &amp; terrible teaching. TA Olivia is nice and knows how to teach. So you may want to go to her if you have any issues. There also seems to be a lack of understanding and communication between the prof and the TAs. The professor told us to Canvas message her the report, few days later the TAs asked us to fill in a form on another site. There is also a clash between the prof and TAs about giving out the project scores.",

Just copy and paste them because her slides are all in PPT with different sizes so making them into one WORD document with one font size was much better for revision. The midterm &amp; final content didn't deviate much from classroom notes. <br /><br />2. I studied really hard for the coding parts of the LAB sessions. If you want to ensure you get an overall A grade, DO NOT SKIP&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR REVISION OVER THE LAB SESSIONS. REPEAT- MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE STUDY GUIDE. This is the make-it-or-break-it for finals, not the classroom notes. <br /><br />3. ATTEND the midterm and final review sessions.

If a huge chunk of the whole course is just packed with the so-called &quot;managerial insights&quot; without the most basic technical detail, it's misleading in the sense that it's telling us as if IS major does not involve much technical stuff.<br /><br />🔷 Digital Economy<br />🔷 E-Commerce<br />🔶 Online Platforms<br />🔶 Social Media<br />🔷🔶 Software<br />🔷🔶 Hardware<br />🔶 Databases and Business Analytics<br />🔶 Big data<br />🔶 Crowdsourcing<br /><br />🔷 IT Fundamentals<br />🔶 IT Trends<br /><br />The lab section is slightly more relevant. We're introduced with business analytics using Excel VBA and big data analytics using Microsoft Azure. But you need a little bit of statistics background (e.g. simple linear regression, the concept of R-square, etc) to better understand what the heck is going on.<br /><br />🔷 Google Web Analytics<br />🔷 Microsoft Access Database Management<br />🔷 Business Analytics with Microsoft Excel<br />🔷 Advanced Business Analytics with Excel VBA<br />🔷 Big Data Analytics with Microsoft Azure<br /><br />Overall the course could have been better structured to reflect and give us a preview of how the IS major is like.",
            "comment_teaching": "Probably Tat Koon is limited by the crappy design of the course content, but I'm afraid to say that his lectures really add no values to enhancing our understanding of the course materials. He has a tendency to over-explain simple stuff and initiates discussion on issues that are already trivial to most of us. That's why I decided to skip almost all lectures after the midterm.<br /><br />The most disappointing part is how he handled the course console issue. He could have easily known that the server couldn't handle such a large course when he picked a plan in which the max_connection parameter is merely 30. (WTF??) Throughout the whole process he reacted in a way hoping the situation would &quot;automatically&quot; get better by extending deadlines, but every one of us knew that the minor stuff couldn't solve the problem at all. It wasn't until the third round of presentation when he came up with a more reasonable solution of utilizing the Google Forms to replace the course console. Thanks to his &quot;timely&quot; response a lot of us stayed in front of our laptops the whole night refreshing the course console website in frustration (which worsened the situation).<br /><br />Btw the hidden messages in his ppt are just words in white that can be easily revealed by a PDF editor like Adobe Acrobat.<br /><br />On the other hand, the lab TA has an annoying Hong Kong Chinglish accent and a mosquito-like sharp voice that drives you nuts. But other than her English proficiency everything else is fine.",
            "comment_grading": "❓ 20% Class participation<br />💻 15% Labs<br />💬✏️ 20% Group project<br />✏️ 20% Midterm exam<br />✏️ 25% Final exam<br /><br />Absurd non-sense. 15% out of the 20% class participation is based on how the other project groups rated your feedback of their own presentations. (Read: NEVER give low marks to them even if their work is sh!t, or they revenge by giving you a low rating in return) The other 5% is basically the online assignments that are posted on Canvas &quot;secretly&quot;, i.e. you don't even know the existence of the assignments if you don't check the Canvas regularly. The assignments are basically a piece of cake for us, but since nobody ever mentions that the assignments are released, if you miss them, you lose the marks. You're graded based on whether you check the Canvas or not.<br /><br />Tat Koon claimed that he aimed to increase the weighting of the group project and decrease the weighting of exams, but he beat his own mouth by giving us more or less similar scores in the group project. As it turned out exams were still the dominant factor that differentiated A's, B's and C's. The group project? In IS terms, non-negotiable but also a non-differentiator of your grade. Just finish the project. DON'T put too much effort into it.<br /><br />We were also somehow misled into thinking that the lab final exam was a part the 25% of the final exam, but it turned out that it was 10% out of the 15% of the lab part. Thus actual weighting of all exams combined is 55%, more important than it seems.<br /><br />Midterm<br />Mean = 28.2/34. SD = 3. I got 1.13 SD above mean.<br /><br />Final<br />Mean = 38/49. SD = 6.8. I got around 1.25 SD above mean.<br /><br />Lab final<br />Mean = 38.7/50. SD = 6.9. I got around 1.35 SD above mean.<br /><br />Project presentation<br />Our group was one of the groups that scored the minimum, but it was still a 9/10. The highest was 9.8. With such small standard deviation, it doesn't really matter whether your group did well or not in the project.<br /><br />I believe all of us were taken by surprise with such a technically oriented final exam. mySQL was heavily tested and the proportion of long questions asking on those managerial insights were greatly reduced.<br /><br />Benefiting from this exam-oriented grading scheme, I got an A at the end.<br /><br />Btw there is no correlation between active participation in class and the final grade. I got an A even though I am an introvert that never spoke up in class, and I skipped a lot of lessons as well.",

There isn't much content in the first place.<br /><br />Feel free to skip lectures - you won't miss anything if you skip all of them. And again, simply use a PDF editor to reveal the hidden lines in his lecture slides.<br /><br />Labs - compulsory attendance.

You weren't in class yesterday.&quot; I was like whattttt. <br /><br />Pray to have a good team for group project since it really matters !! Normally groups think of platform and applications so maybe think outside the box!! <br /><br />Also stop making time management and meeting apps. Everyone wants to make one. Unless you can get a real prototype, then don't even mention a meeting app!!",

Meanwhile it delayed the class schedule, so she cut some of the topics stated in the syllabus. It turns out that, in the non-cumulative final exam, only content from the last 3 lectures(most are SQL, which overlab with those in lab, &amp; Fintech) is tested.

Points jump here and there and the pages are not coherent. You will not understand the core messages she wants to convey during lessons. <br /><br />The WORST thing is the participation part. You have the answer/ raise questions during lessons and claim your participation credit on Canvas afterwards. It makes people simply just wonder what to ask her instead of focusing on course content. I personally use a trick by asking chatgpt what can I ask the professor on the topic xyz. <br /><br />And when you ask her questions, often she can't really give you a concrete answer. Sometimes she even repeats the question and asks the students back.<br /><br />Lab teaching is fine. I'm in Olivia's class. A little bit too fast but she explains clearly when you ask her questions (unlike our DEAR professor I'm sorry)",

I know nothing more about my grades in other components. I got A+ finally. <br /><br />But still I would give a C to the grading because she doesn't know how to compose a proper exam paper. MCs worth 4-5 marks in Midterm and Final. Some of the MCs are poorly asked and some are too trivial. Long question are just bluffing (7 marks for a question short question). You can see the mean is crazily high as well. To get good grades I think work hard + luck to successfully read yanzhen's mind.",

He also encourages everyone to answer his questions. Feel free to contact him after class if you have any questions regarding the materials. I think he is very helpful and would somehow inspire you. Yet, he didn't really care for the group project. Even if you asked him questions regarding the project, he would just hea respond to you. <br />One thing to mention, I saw a comment saying he is a bit bossy. But I think as the comment said, he just needs basic respect. Be a responsible student and control your volume especially when your professor's teaching is not hea. You can see from his eyes that he is actually quite passionate about teaching this course.",
            "comment_grading": "Super good. I have only answered around 3 questions in the class and got full marks for my discussion contribution. Make sure you have joined the Canvas discussion and the lecture which has in-class discussion. Everyone would get parti if you attended the lecture since he would come to each seat and ask questions. <br />For the lecture exam (Mid-Term and Final), just make sure you understand each topic. Topics are quite easy to handle since most of them are just blowing water. I think for an average person, you just need to spend a few hours before the lecture exam if you have paid attention to the lecture. For the lab exam, it just questions repeating the lab quiz. So make sure you understand the lab quiz. You can do the unlimited exercise provided by TA before the Lab exam on Canvas. If you could get the full marks and understand each question, I think that'll be np for the lab exam.<br />For the group project, while you are presenting, the professor won't actually give af at all. I remember after the presentation, I sat behind the prof and saw him doing his own work for the groups he was not interested in, and only raised his head and clapped at the end of those presentations. But I think you will get 18/20 even if you performed not that well since he didn't really give af at all. If you really want to get the full mark, make sure you make your idea interesting.<br /><br />My grade: A<br />Discussion Contribution: 15/15<br />Lab: 13.5/15<br />Group Project: 18/20<br />Midterm Exam: 22/25<br />Final Exam: 20.75/25<br />Mean: 78.51, SD: 8.66<br />And that's my first A in UST.

There will be a special emphasis on the digital economy, e-commerce, and business analytics. Other topics include: hardware/software, networking, the Internet, database, security, and social media.

He'll remember your face ( he walks around with a sheet of paper with everyone's name and photo printed on it, trust me he'll know). He also walks around with a microphone and randomly picks students to answer stuff. Don't need to worry too much the questions aren't hard and open-ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I don't find his voice boring and he talks about examples, shows videos, and tells you to interact with peers to discuss before answering the qestion.",

And sometimes comments he considers valuable can earn you extra credit.<br /><br />Remember to attend industry week and don't skip other groups' presentation cuz it counts towards participation. <br /><br />For the group project, he asked us to design an app, and write a business proposal first, then a presentation and a business plan. I recommend arranging a meeting with the professor before you submit the proposal to discuss you idea, he does give some useful advice and guidance so make sure you follow them. I would recommend sending your ppt to him before the presentation, he would give you helpful feedback and you can make some final adjustments.<br /><br />exams are noncumulative. He tends to ask super tiny details about the slides, so you need to remember everything, especially the statistics, if you are aiming for a decent score. Mean is pretty high for the midterm, so its definitely competitive.<br /><br />I scored around mean for midterm and got full mark on lab final and project proposals. Other scores are unreleased, but I got an A in the end.

This semester was open-book because of online class. I asked the T.A. about why I did poorly in the midterm. Apparently, they grade based on markscheme so don't even bother with alternative explanations (e.g. from personal knowledge).<br /><br />It's ironic how this course taught about &quot;information overload&quot; as one of the jargons, because it would be a representation of it.",

I attended 100% of lectures so I can say that you'll be fine skipping like 80% of them. Accent is bearable, but professor reading from the slides is extremely boring. Kudos to the palpable effort though. Before the midterm and lecture final, there is a Q&amp;A session so maybe attend that. For the midterm, sample MCQs were discussed in class so go to the last two sessions. For the lecture final, there were no practices, just the Q&amp;A.<br /><br />Professor's good when it comes to the ADP. Consult your ideas with her and try to make an impression, since scores for this component are undisclosed. <br /><br />Contact T.A. Samuel if you want to ask about grades and some lab stuff. In-person checking is allowed but for online, he gives a breakdown of MCQ score and tips on the essay portion (based on experience asking for midterm).<br /><br />Really enjoyed T.A.

Anyway, this turns out to be a great decision!<br /><br />As a person who has come across 2 professors' teaching, here is an honest comparison: Muller&gt;&gt;&gt;Chen. <br /><br />Even though it is the first year (I believe) that Muller taught ISOM2010, his teaching is really great and accent is much more understandable than Chen (makes a huge diff here cos you can barely learn anything from chen's class with her accent).

This is a blessing, as we have 3 hour long exams in FINA 2303. The project isn't too much of a hassle, especially if you have good group members. I am lucky to be with a good team and I'm glad Professor Chan allows us to choose our group members. <br /><br />Professor Chan does not require a presentation for the project, which eases the workload of it. We need to turn in a 3 page report and 6-slide long roadshow slide, which is fairly easy to handle.<br /><br />For industry week, we were required to attend two zoom talks.

However, her teaching got much better towards the end of the semester. She delivers any main point in a good manner, and her powerpoint slides were organized and easy to follow. <br /><br />Her voice is quite soft. I took her 9am lecture, and believe me, as a student without a hall, you will definitely fall asleep in her lesson. On the other hand, she listens to students' opinions and tries to improve her teaching in the process. When some students pointed out that her voice was too soft, she brought a louder mic in the following lesson in the hopes that we will be satisfied.

Her grading is not exceptionally bad, at least from my perspective. Here are my stats in examinations:<br />Midterm: above mean ~0.5sd<br />Final: below mean ~0.5sd<br />Lab: maximum (above mean ~1sd)<br />Attendance: all full except I missed one reflection on industry week<br />Project: around mean (slightly below)<br />Participation: should be full, stat not provided<br /><br />Final Grade: B<br /><br />I think it is quite fair.

Towards the end of the semester, the workload noticibaly increased as you would need to complete the presentation and business plan within like 2 weeks. <br /><br />Also, you would need to attend a 1-hour long lab session every week on top of your normal lecture. The lab session, unlike the lecture, is compulsory and attendance is required.

NO PRESENTATION THIS YEAR in this professor's lecture, while other professors require presentation.<br />Just memorising the lecture materials.<br />Remember don't fully rely on the summary sheet provided by professor. It is fake. This year, the final asked about Bitcoin ownership and something related to Bitcoin, for example, how the private and public keys generated. These are not shown in the summary sheet. Be well-prepared by preparing both summary sheet and memorising the PPT. Sometimes, google will help you a lot as well, concepts like bitcoin, the five forces(can't remember the name LOL).",

Leaders who fail to understand the operational and strategic importance of information systems (IS) will not be able to keep up with the pace of their competitors. IS have moved beyond the automation of back office functions into the foreground of business strategy, and play critical roles in competitive positioning and business process design.<br />This course provides a broad coverage of technology concepts and trends underlying current and future developments in information technology (IT), and fundamental principles for the effective use of computer- based information systems. There will be a special emphasis on e-commerce, business integration and IT management. Other topics include: hardware/software, networking, the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW), databases, security, and enterprise applications. In additional to the fundamental conceptual and propositions in the IS area, a number of business applications and cases will be discussed; the newest trend in today’s technology domain will also be discussed.",

Honestly, I do not see any rationale in the way she grades and neither does she give you any recommendations as to how to improve the paper. Firstly, the project proposal we gave her received only very little comments, the presentation itself, she had only one question but the overall score for the paper was sooo low that it brought the grades of all of my group mates down. Not only that, the questions she gave to the other groups seemed rather hostile and derogatory. It almost seems as if she was really trying to bring them down as if she takes some joy out of doing it. Every time I go up to her to ask a question in class, she responds with a flurry of questions that only confused and discouraged to learn more about the course's content. Truth be told, this is the most appalling course AND EDUCATOR that I have ever encountered in my life PERIOD",

That said, Professor Zhang tries to give as many students grades in the A range, so your hard work should be reflected in your grade.<br /><br />In addition, there are also weekly tutorials and the content covered in the later lab sessions is assessed in a lab paper that is given during the final exam session.

In class, just taked so brief and &quot;hea&quot;, and showing video for more than half ot the class every lessons. Most materials didn't explain to us and say it out only. <br /><br />I would say he is the poorest prof i had ever seen. Definitely, other profs of ISOM2010 woulkd have heavier workload, but they can teach and have the heart in teaching, most importantly, the grading is better.

There are a lot of concepts which we can seldom apply to real life. His group projects are also extremely meaningless and I learnt nothing from it. He tried to have us to include some IS concepts in the development of the app, but those concepts will no longer be included in the final exam so it actually helps us nothing towards our learning.",

Sometimes he will hide some key concepts or information and we must attend his lectures in order to get the missing part of the powerpoint. Yet, his lectures are actually extremely boring and not fun at all. He asks quite a number of questions but actually only international students will answer the questions. He does not even try to help local students to engage or to be involved more in the lectures deliberately. Moreover, his comment giving to group presentations, which is supposed to be the most useful for the groups for their final reports, are even shorter than those written by other students. I expected so much from his comments but turned out it did not help me even for any little bit.",

Although he says that class participation will not matter a lot on the grades, I am quite sure that he has weighting on the students' score (he claimed that he has upgraded all students' grades by multiplying each student's score by a certain constant) based on their participation. It is very unfair for people who are not that active but still worked hard on the exams.",

We may apply the wrong concepts on the exams but we have no way to know as there is no homework to practise our learnings. He is too lazy to put up any homework but yet have the time and effort to make his own website, which does not work most of the time. Even when it works, it is loading at an extremely low speed. I expect him to put some homework on his website. Moreover, he put up some reading assignments but do not have any announcement to remind us to do the work.
