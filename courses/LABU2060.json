Previous LANG courses are all about things in an academic setting, but in this LABU course you need to pack and present yourself well.",

All sorts of these happen when you have highly motivated group mates, but obviously these things could harm at the end.<br /><br />On the other hand, if your delivery is good you don't quite need to dedicate a lot of efforts to ace the course.",

He also answers questions after class nicely is quite responsive on email.<br /><br />His spoken English definitely isn't native, and you can hear some Cantonese accent. But his ability to write in a concise, cohesive and organized manner is very impressive. He once showed us how he rewrote a paragraph from his student's report, which really proved himself to be highly qualified as a LABU teacher.<br /><br />He does, however, tend to be a bit too creative at times. He likes to encourage us to &quot;think out of the box&quot;, and his sample answers to the challenging interview questions are sometimes so creative and unrealistic that HR/recruiters in real life would probably be skeptical of. And quite often he would ever so slightly misinterpret students' answers, but that is not a big issue. <br /><br />He is a fun man and I had quite a lot of fun in his classes. Also appreciate that he gave quite detailed written feedback for all our assignments.",

I think I got around 6/6/6 for the job interview and didn't do so well for the impromptu (his feedback did say that I didn't fulfill many of the requirements). In the end I got A-, which I think is pretty fair (or maybe a bit high) according to how I think I performed.",

I spent one evening preparing answers to some standard interview questions, and that was it.<br /><br />The innovation requires a bit more work, and it depends on your groupmates (John let us pick our own groupmates if we wanted to, but seems like none of us knew each other). I had helpful groupmates, we had 3-4 short meetings to discuss the topic and divide our parts. The hard part is making enough content for 20 minutes. <br /><br />Writing the report is easier since by then you will have all your contents, all you need to do is find some more background information and present it in a nice report.

Please well prepare for it.<br /><br />2. Imprmoptu Speech (15%)<br />Give you a question (argumentative one) and prepare it in 3-min.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then make a speech for 3-min. Difficult to prepare, but make sure you fulfil the requirement of your tutor<br /><br />Rundown: open zoom with your face, receive question , prep 3 min, then your face can disappear for around 4-5 min for shooting a 3 min video, then appear your face again, wait until your tutor receive your video, then leave<br /><br />3. Group Project<br />Think of a startup/company for improving the community. You need to use the same thing for the writing and presentation<br />(a) Writing (30%) (individual)<br />&lt;1200 writing for your business plan. There are some spcific structure/requirement you need to fulfil. Wrote very clearly in Canvas. Read them.<br />(b) Group Presentation (20%)+peer evaluation (5%)<br />15min presentation. This semester is making a zoom recording only. You can NG as many times as you can. But usually the technical problem wastes you lots of time.<br />This semester does not have Q&amp;A<br /><br />4. Class participation (10%)<br />If you are still not able to entertain the tutor when this is the third/fourth Lang class, getting a bad grade is common.",

Each will be responsible for writing one of the three documents. You will negotiate with your team and write the preliminary market analysis, the progress report and the business plan.<br /><br />Phase III is pitch presentation and peer evaluation.

            "comment_teaching": "not much teaching honestly<br />everyone was confused abt what we had to do in the beginning as she gave no instructions about the webpage that we were asked to create for the job interview (first assessed task). she didnt even mention how we could hand it in until sb asked her and she said that everyone who did it could get full marks. (so wheres the differentiation when everyone can get full marks? idk if its absolute grading or not but obviously she cant give everyone As)<br /><br />For the second assessed task, we were asked to do impromptu speaking (3mins prep on the spot and 3 mins ans). she did quite enough practice with us for that. like we were asked to do a mock practice in front of everyone in class but she gave little feedback for that she just smiled, laughed a little, gave some general comments and asked us to watch our own videos at home. (yes, she asked us to use our phone to record ourselves in this mock practice) so i feel like she was just enjoying herself when we were doing the practice. <br /><br />Then we were asked to do a startup group project. We were asked to think of an idea and do an individual report+ group pitch for that. <br />She just held the notes given by lang centre and read them out during lessons. I tried to ask her questions but she just kinda read and referred back to the lang centre notes. seems like shes not fully prepared.<br /><br />For the final pitch, seems like she did not wanna give any comments on our idea at all. like she gave us free discussion lessons. good thing is everything can be settled during lessons which means no needa meet up outside class. she held a consultation session. but unlike other lang tutors, she wont really guide u through. u have to ask her qs and she could barely give u constructive feedback (like she nodded, and said yes and agreed, but at the end of the day, does she really agree with that?)",

He did prepare his own lecture slides, but most of the time he was just reading the content aloud. There would be in-class practice for oral assessments and brainstorming time for the business pitch, but it could be a disaster when he taught business writing. You would even learn faster by simply reading the slides and supplementary materials prepared by him.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Levi was open to questions both after class&nbsp;&nbsp;and through email. He could also recognize all of his students - he mentioned someone in class who had also taken his LABU2040 in previous semesters! His teaching was not always effective, but he did care about his students.",

Although my average grade of mock interview and impromptu speech lied between &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Satisfactory&quot;, I got B at the end. Class participation is really crucial for you to get a decent grade from Levi.",
            "comment_workload": "Not heavy. You just have to spend at most 2 hours for digital portfolio and preparation of typical interview questions. Don't expect any technical questions as most tutors will just evaluate your performance on your use of language. Also, don't choose jobs that require so much technical knowledge because you won't receive good grades if your tutor don't understand what's your potential job duties. For impromptu speech, you really have nothing to prepare in advance. Just calm down before you choose your topic and try your best not to hesitate during your speech.<br /><br />For business writing and business pitch, they are based on a tourism-related business idea of your group's choice. I give a C for workload because my group mates don't really care about this and I have to do many things beyond my own parts. Good luck if there are freeriders in your group.",

As long as the student puts effort into the not so fair workload, the course is unlikely to fail you.<br />Do keep in mind that attendance is quite important in this course and put the course in the time you think you can stay awake for the longest or simply not skip class. If you miss 10 classes in the course, you will be required to retake the course later on. And your active participation will also leave a good image in the instructors mind which will definitely help in the grading portions for this course because the assessment materials a quite subjective.",

Each class has 1-2 discussions.<br />I actually learn something from these discussions because you have to keep speaking, but If i have choices I prefer not to learn from this. I stay in this class because of time clash in timetable.",
