            "comment_content": "Course content is well-designed. First half is about basic Fina concepts like time value of money, present &amp; future values, normal firm cash flows, and calculation of perpetuity, annuity, and bond values. It is easy to fall behind a little but the content is actually not that hard (most of the calculation questions can be solved by applying the formulas) <br /><br />Calculations are more difficult in the first half than the later half imo, but there are more formulas to remember after midterm. Topics include mainly equity and project valuation, capital budgeting, and costs of capital. <br /><br />2 lessons each week but only need to go to one, the first lesson each week is replaced by an online video lecture. <br /><br />For Peter Mackay, MT was conducted online on Canvas, with 2/3 conceptual MC questions and the remaining calculation short questions. Due to the instructor's absurd laziness, FT is face-to-face 40 MC questions, also 2/3 conceptual and 1/3 calculations. MT was open-book and Final allows a 2-sided A4 cheatsheet.",
            "comment_teaching": "Fucking hideous, for 2 main reasons. <br /><br />Course content is fine as aforementioned, according to the textbook (same publisher as ACCT 2010, with a lot of practice exercises and quizzes which is useful af) You can self-study the textbook smoothly. However, Peter tends to deviate from the textbook and teaches as he likes, while not giving a fuck about supplementary materials. So there is no way to practice or study those extra stuff on your own. I self-study the entire textbook and is completely lost doing Peter's quizzes. <br /><br />Also, this bloke is the laziest ass I have ever seen. He claims the&nbsp;&nbsp;Canvas quiz questions are from a large question base, yet I see the same questions 6 times, in iPRS, then in the weekly quiz, then in mock MT, MT, mock Final, and final. How the fuck can I differentiate myself from the other students if all we have to do to score high is to memorise the answers. Even his Zoom lecture videos are pre-recorded and used across the 4 lecture classes he teaches. This guy even suggested to conduct the final in the Sports Hall via bloody Canvas, so he doesn't have to mark the papers. At last he still doesnt have to mark the papers because even the calculation questions are MCs. Fuck this guy. <br /><br />However, if you already have most of the questions and the sources, you can just memorise most of the questions and you will be very happy to find them again in the papers.",

But if you want to score high for major selection then this bloke is the worst prof you can ever choose. <br /><br />So angry after the final so I wrote this review before my grades are out.

And that means if you get wrong so many times like me, you will need to do tonnes of questions again :) Doing the exercise is not the problem, the problem is, the questions you are dealing with, are something he has NEVER EVER mentioned or taught in the classes.

This course also gives a good indicator to whether you are interested in majoring in FINA related majors or not-if you hate this course then maybe seek other majors of your interest.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Pi is a nice professor. She always attempted to interact in class and make friends with us, some of us even troll along in the chatbox and she went along with it. In class, she always tried her hardest to explain the concepts in finance by drawing diagrams and visualization. However, as this semester is online, it is quite often that she encounters technical problems, like problems with IPRS and breakout rooms, which kind of worsen our learning experience. All in all, I would say that she is decent at teaching.",
            "comment_grading": "A. Class participation 10%<br />Class participation is divided into two parts. One part is the IPRS question (by attendance), and another part is the breakout room exercise (1 PDF submission per group within 30 minutes after the lecture ends). I should get almost full marks in this.<br />B. 11 MFL homework assignments (best 10)--&gt; [best 8 of 9] 16%<br />Due to syllabus cutting, it changed to the best 8 of 9 assignments. I got full marks in 7 of them, remaining two are 94% and 86% respectively. Be sure to double-check before checking answers as those counts towards your grade.<br />C. Online Quizzes (2) 4%<br />The first online quiz is super difficult and the mean is around 4/8, I got 5/8. <br />The second online quiz is much easier and many got full or near full marks, I got 6/6.<br />D. Midterm Exam 30%<br />The midterm exam is quite difficult and the mean is around 68/92 (8 marks are for bonus), I got near full marks for this.<br />E. Final Exam (non-cumulative) 40%<br />The final exam is easier. Although there are no mean or other statistical figures, I guess the mean will be in the mid-70s. I got 80 something for the final, probably because of some careless mistakes.<br /><br />I got A finally and I don't know what to say about the grading, it could be tough or lenient depending on your point of view. Personally I am satisfied with my grade, but for other classmates, some worked their ass off throughout the semester but got B and B- finally, so it may be unfair to some. However, one thing that I could say is that this course is super competitive, and don't expect to get into the A-range paying subpar efforts.",
            "comment_workload": "I would say the workload really depends on your ambition.<br />Some people who are ambitious (A-range hunter) would spend hours on practising the question banks on Pearson MyFinanceLab before quizzes and exams, while others would not be as diligent.<br />In terms of the course requirement, there is basically an online homework every week and it takes around half an hour to finish (9 in total this semester). So most workload lies in self-studying for the quizzes and midterms, constant effort should be made to achieve high.",

She made it super easy, which means that if you didnt do well in any one of the exam even you get full mark in the other one you will never get an A range. I think a normal exam paper should have normal distribution of marks but hers is totally a left tail. <br /><br />Midterm and final questions are all MCQs and the median of the final is 85 with a mean of 80. Which is totally crazy. <br /><br />I didnt do well in midterm with a mark of 88（mean 79）, I think if I can do well in final I can make my grade better. But she made the final super easy and turns out I get 98 and then I get a B+.<br /><br />The grade is very very bad. Not because of the percentage of A's given, is because of a super easy midterm and final cannot allow you to make any mistakes. Even you are very talented in finance, you may screw it once you make careless mistakes.",

When you put this course in the second year of your BBA study, the amount of workload will definitely kill you with that many presentations and pop quizzes in other subjects. And of course, if you are not in BBA, but in ECOF or QFIN, then you have much time to study this course (as the school always favor these students).",

He will distribute &quot;small yellow&quot; participation cards throughout the semester, and when you get six (?), your participation will get full marks. But I dunno if the TAs will really recognize your face or not, as it seems to me that even though you didn't answer any questions, you can still get that card.",

He gave questions that a lot of us did not understand, much less how to break down. Even with explanations, we were too lost due to knowledge gap. It took a good 3-4 weeks before he turned it down a notch and kind of realized how basic the course was needed to be.<br /><br />Only made powerpoints for add-drop period, and maybe 1 or 2 additional lectures. The rest of the lectures were essentially spent on mostly off he top of his head questions, and working on them on blank sheets of paper, as well as Yahoo Finance. These papers would then be uploaded and titled &quot;lecture notes&quot;. Really not that useful if you don't understand the concepts themselves. <br /><br />Even at the end, I don't think he actually realized how much we didn't know, nor how little he learnt from his teaching. He could be a little condescending at times, particularly after taking iPRS and seeing the majority of the class got the wrong answer despite it being &quot;straight-forward&quot;.<br /><br />Cannot comment on tutorials, was never able to attend due to schedule overlap.<br /><br />I learnt more from My Finance Lab and taking notes from the textbook than I ever did in the lectures. If you have this professor, know that the lectures will most likely not be useful. Sleep through it, until iPRS, then self-study.",

For something so basic, it should definitely not have taken this much time to learn. If anything, the lectures confused me rather than taught.

Topics include the time value of money, bond and stock valuation, capital budgeting, risk, and return concepts, and cost of capital. You are required to purchase the ebook published by Pearson. For face-to-face lectures, you may need to buy a finance calculator for your exam and exercise. However, for online lectures, you are free to use different software during the exam and exercise. You can use excel to do the calculations.",

There are also five small quiz questions every Sunday. Sometimes the content is not easy and it is not easy to get full marks. There were about four assignments, they weren't too hard, and there was a chance to check them, and almost everyone got a perfect score.

However, students must spend the time normally spent in class for a traditional lecture to review the VOS in preparation for the ICA. There is no “free lunch”. 2) Our time together in class (face-to-face or virtually) can be spent productively, covering applications of the material. 3) This format allows students to better manage their time according to their own needs and preferred study style. The VOS can be viewed at will and harder passages can be reviewed as needed, after or before reading the textbook.

Study hard too as it counts as 3% of the course grade.<br /><br />The midterm is definitely difficult, despite I studied hard, the mean and sd are super high such that I cannot get above the mean for 0.5 sd. It is quite sad and disappointing. Be careful in your calculations to avoid careless mistakes.<br /><br />Some other reviews mentioned that the final exam is difficult. However, I think that it is actually easier than the midterm with less complicated calculations. Just have more practice in my finance lab, then you would be fine. With hard work and clear concepts, I got well above mean a lot and got the second highest mark in the class.<br /><br />If you want to get a good grade, try to understand every important concept in class as there are conceptual questions in assessments, and some questions might be slightly changed from the usual practices and rely on your real understanding of the formulas.

Overall, the content was highly interesting though and changed the way I personally observe the business world around me. I now know so many more finance concepts that are useful for everyday life and daily conversations.<br /><br />Keep in mind, you do need to purchase a book (Pearson's Fundamentals of Corporate Finance) or at least an access code for the online version of the book and the online learning portal called My Finance Lab -&gt; this is also where you have to submit your homework.",

Unfortunately many people in our class decided to turn off their cameras and don't interact at all, but those who did keep their cameras on and asked questions really formed a bit of a bond with him. He was always happy when people showed up and it made him sad when people turned off their cameras. Please turn on your cameras and ask questions, he loves the interaction!<br /><br />Emilio always makes sure everyone is on the same page and spent lots of time explaining the basic concepts, in the beginning, to make sure people don't get lost further down the line in the course. He will always allow the opportunity to ask questions and will also provide helpful answers (the TA too, btw - make sure you take advantage of the TA when you're having trouble).",

            "comment_workload": "Weekly MFL isn't too difficult especially with unlimited attempts. In past years, I believe it was just 3 attempts per question. The disadvantage is that everyone probably received full marks for the 15% component. Just remember to set the deadlines in your calendar.<br /><br />Preparation for the exams is the real scare - countless hours of MFL practice is a must and then possibly reading the book (Ekkachai advised to read the entire book at least once), although honestly lecture notes should suffice.",

During each ICA, there will be an iPRS quiz of 4-5 questions, each question will be out of 2 marks, 1 for participation, the other for the correctness. Grades for each ICA will be out by the end of that week.<br /><br />2. 5 Homework Assignments (on connect system, keep top 4/5) 16% - questions are usually pretty standard and are all in the textbook<br /><br />*3. 1st midterm (MC) 20% – Median: 22/30, Mean: 21.58/30, SD: 4.09<br /><br />*4. 2nd Midterm (MC) 18% – Median: 23, Mean 22.4, SD: 4.55<br /><br />*5.

You need to answer correctly 10 questions for the entire sem to get the full 2%, do not worry cuz he'll ask far more questions than that.

The formulas are not that difficult to understand, but make sure you understand how to apply them in the word problems that Veronique likes to ask. <br /><br />TIP: Definitely read the textbook, which I find much more helpful in explaining the concepts than simply going to class.",

Some valuation models learned in this course, such as DDM, DFCFM, CAPM, are useful in the valuation of a corporation and stock. However, it is a theoretical course whose contents may not be practical into the real market. Most of the contents are conceptual and requires a little calculation. A financial calculator will be helpful to your calculations.",

However, professor will use some real world cases to improve our sense of finance. Besides, Veronique is really a great professor! She is really cute!!!

            "comment_content": "The content is well organised and refers directly to the textbook, so it's quite straightforward to reference between the two. Since it's an introductory finance course, some of the more advanced topics in the chapters are occasionally skipped. <br /><br />Course contents include financial statement analysis, time value of money, interest rates, bonds, stocks, investment decision rules, fundamentals of capital budgeting, risk and return, equity risk premium, and WACC. <br /><br />Lecture slides are posted for each topic, and the answers to all the in-class exercises are also provided for revision.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof. Pi is a good teacher and she explains all the concepts very clearly to students during lectures. Her lecture slides and teaching are very organised and based of the textbook, so it's pretty straightforward to follow through. The TA is also really helpful, and weekly tutorials are held where the TA goes through and solves some example problems from each chapter.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is relatively fair. <br /><br />There are four components which contribute to the final grade: class participation (10%), MFL homework assignments (15%), midterm exam (30%), final exam (45%). <br /><br />There are 10 homework assignments to be completed during the course (very useful to do these because firstly they contribute to your grade, and secondly, it's good practice for the exams).<br /><br />Midterm and final exam have three components - conceptual questions, numerical questions, and challenging questions. <br /><br />The midterm exam mean was 73/100 with SD 13, and final exam mean was 72/115 with SD 17.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload really depends on the grade you want in this course. If you want a good grade, you have to invest a lot of time in solving all the problems on MFL and going through all the course content carefully.

When attending his lectures, I really could feel his passion of teaching- he would cover everything that would be useful and practical in the reality (not just for the exam) even though some contents were out-of-syllabus. For his session, there would be a case study written by him, on which you would have the opportunity to apply what you have learnt in this course. If you really want to learn or even want to take finance as your major, I would suggest you to take his sessions.<br /><br />Second, he was a really nice and down-to-earth professor. No matter whether it was at weekends or on the weekdays, no matter whether your questions were stupid or not, he would always be willing to reply your emails and they were very detailed (in Cantonese: not just 'hea'-ing you).",

Lai would have some so-called challenging questions which would be asked in the lectures for participation. Everyone would be asked, 3 marks would be given if you answer it correctly, partial credits would also be given if you could not give the full answer but zero if you are absent. In fact, as long as you are not absent and you try to answer, M.K. Lai would give full mark to you anyway, so don't worry too much.",

            "comment_teaching": "He did not teach anything, but we are forced to attend his classes :( <br />He will disappear some days as he is a busy man and have so 9 important meetings oversea, but on the other hand, attendance will be taken each lesson. SO UNFAIR!!!!!! <br />If you are someone whose learning style is from attending classes and listening from teacher, DUN REG HIM!!!!!!! But if you are poison guy like me whose learning style is to fold liba or home to read books and do excerise. This course is quite suitable for you (because you can fight down students who need to attend class to learn)",
            "comment_grading": "The grading system is quite fair, although someone claim the exam is very hard. Students are still graded based on the performance of others. (Although your exam score might not be as high as other class, you can still scoreabove 1 sd)<br /><br />I agree that Finance exam should be hard as it can determine which students is more suitable for FINA classes, some review last year said that most of the students have overall score of 90% or above. 1% higher or lower = 1 sub grade. But in this class the distribution is quite high. So you can score higher than others if you are REALLY SUITABLE FOR FINA<br /><br />MY Grade:<br />Homework 1: 90/100<br />Homework 2: 97.5/100<br />homework 3: 100/100<br /><br />Mid term exam 94/100<br />Final exam 79.5/100<br /><br />My finance lab assignments 14.92/15<br /><br />Parti: 5/5<br /><br />Overall: 89.59% = A*<br />So if you can score more than 90% in his class, you will have A*!!!!!",
            "comment_workload": "So 9 heavy!!!! But its fina course, what do you expect?? If you want fina as your major. of cus you need to work hard to earn it<br />This class rewards students who work hard as you can score much higher compare to others and you have less chance for one on99 careless mistakes = loss one subgrade<br />If you really want to major FINA and you know you will work much harder than others to earn it, reg this class. If you dont want to major fina, and just want a good GPA, DONT REG THIS CLASS!!!!!!",

Nice PowerPoint and user-friendly!<br /><br />We have Zoom audience this semester. He often engages with people on Zoom that he never ignores them, unlike other professors!

He explains every subtle details clearly with valid examples, I am enchanted with the bullet example he used to describe and explain the CAPM model, which was exceptionally useful in helping me understand the concept. Also, his PowerPoint slides are colourful and informative where you can study them with the help of VOS, which explains the materials nicely and concisely.<br />For his teaching style. He is so caring and always interacts with students. That’s why there was a day where the lecture room was full of students and there weren’t even enough seats. There are 6 IPRS during each class, but the first question is always asking students about their day, which gives us so much love and warmth. Also, he will make sure every student is ready in order to run the IPRS countdown, so there is nothing to be stressed about.",
