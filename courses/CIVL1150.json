        "description": "As the extreme weather events emerge as one of the most prominent global risks, climate change and the accompanying natural disasters are no longer a side agenda, but play a critical role in maintaining sustainable societies and economies. This course aims to inspire students to take a broader perspective on environmental issues, in addition to advancing the scientific knowledge of climate change and extreme weather. To effectively achieve this purpose, the course introduces the case studies that emphasize the huge implications of extreme events (e.g. drought, flood, heat waves, typhoon) and their linkage with the warming due to greenhouse gases. This course also assesses the potential impacts of climate changes and extremes on social, economic and environmental sustainability through a multidisciplinary approach.",

Before mid-term, we focus on climate models and some background knowledge like energy balance, greenhouse effect, which are quite impressing. After the mid-term, we focus on the impact of climate change and why 2Â°C warming matters.",

But she was passionate and willing to answer your questions after classes. So you would be fine if you know nothing about climate change.",

            "comment_content": "The content taught in this lecture is actually quite useful in the current society. I think it is an interesting topic to learn about.<br /><br />Climate Change related contents are covered, such as extreme weather events (heatwave, cold wave, etc.), RCP Scenarios, Future Climate Projection and more. If you have any background in geography, this course would be easy for you.<br /><br />Attendance is not necessary, but it would be very challenging to follow the entire course without attending the lectures. She gives a lot of information in lectures and it is not the same to just follow the lecture slides without attending the lectures. I recommend taking all the lectures if possible.",
            "comment_teaching": "She has a hard Korean accent and even as a Korean student, it was not easy to understand as well in the beginning. However, I think it is easy to get used to her accent.<br /><br />In general, her teaching was decent but there were times where it felt very awkward because of the way she teaches. For example, it was when she was giving us feedback for our reports. She picked some samples to show us some good and bad examples and decided to reveal whose report it is and asking them to unmute their mic. I understand she wants to make interactive lectures since she wants you to turn on the webcam for the lectures and tries to randomly pick out students once in a while. However, I do not think she should reveal other students' works in front of the class for obvious reasons.<br /><br />There were more incidents where students were confused. When we took the first quiz, it was challenging to finish the quiz, as time was very limited. It was a quiz where we had to type in our reasoning for the true/false questions, and we had about 20 minutes for answering around 30 questions or more. Also, it was a pop quiz which made it even more challenging. After the quiz, students wanted to discuss the logistics of the quiz, requesting for more time for the future quizzes. However, the way she responded to the students was, &quot;I am the professor and I have the authority to choose the type of the quiz. If everyone felt that they were short in time, everyone is in the same situation so it should not matter.&quot;<br /><br />I personally think the course was not too bad but I personally do not recommend this course because I think there are better courses to take over this course. However, if you are very knowledgable in this area or have a deep interest in this area, it would be a piece of cake for you.",
            "comment_grading": "There are 5 quizzes instead of mid-term exam and final exam. Each quiz is either 10% or 15% worth the final grade. The first 3 quizzes are worth 10% and the remaining 2 quizzes are worth 15%, so in total, it is worth 60%. There are 2 reports to write, one being a data analysis report, worth 30% of the grade. The other report is writing a short essay after watching 2 TED talk videos, worth 10% of the grade.<br /><br />At the beginning of the course, she mentioned that she is a generous grader but I think she grades quite reasonably. She is not a harsh grader for sure but I cannot say she is super generous.",
            "comment_workload": "There are 5 quizzes and 2 reports for the course. Initially, I thought having 5 quizzes might be better than having a mid-term and a final exam but I think it would have been better to have exams instead of quizzes. Each quiz is very short in time and the coverage for each quiz accumulates, meaning that on the last quiz, you are being tested on everything you learned for the term. For the reports, it is probably not as demanding compared to other courses' essay assignments. There is some data analysis to do using Microsoft Excel but then applying the knowledge onto the report is not too difficult. There is quantitatively quite a bit of assignment (quizzes+reports) but they are not super demanding and should be manageable.",
