I think it’s counted in participation, the content is less important than submission.<br /><br />The major workload for this course is individual writing. The individual report is quite hash if you are a deadline fighter as it requires students to read an original and extremely long legal record before writing. This step takes quite a while to understand the content and analysis. The individual report is given about 1 month time to complete, students are advised to start it ASAP and ask prof whenever you have problem! As once you analysis wrong the stance of the court, you have to redo your whole writing! Be aware of this.<br /><br />In class writing doesn’t cause any workload but students are advised to have some practise on case reading and revise on legal concepts, as the time given for this task is quite short and it will be hard to finish if you can’t response quick.",

IP law<br />- trademark, patent, copyright<br /><br />4. Employment law <br />- what should be included in an employment contract<br />- employee vs contractor, their differences and advantages / disadvantages<br /><br />5. Legal writing <br />- how to do legal writing, assignment about analysing a legal case with the legal principles learned in class<br /><br />Every topics in this course is interesting and relevant to our daily life, so they’re really worth learning.

Quiz:<br />- All 3 quizzes are open book, 25 mcq , 50mins<br />- Quizzes are non-cumulative <br />- More then 5 questions in the quiz are from the sample quiz provided <br />So the quiz is very easy and you have lots of time to complete each quiz<br /><br />2. Mini assignment <br />- assigned after each class to reflect on one of the sample case mentioned in the lecture<br />- have a few days to finish it<br />- Assignment graded on effort (you’ll got mark as long as you submit it)<br /><br />3. Individual final report<br />- you’ll be assigned to one of the case as either plaintiff or defendant<br />- You’re asked to write a case brief, an argument for your position and a possible rebuttal from your opponent <br />- word limit 600-800<br />Since the report is just 800 words is it quite easy to complete but required some time to study the case thoroughly to write good analysis<br /><br />4. In-class writing practise<br />- You’ll be learning how to do legal writing a class before the in-class practise<br />It’s a quick and easy practise that asked you to put some legal principles in your reflection. I write quite horribly but still gets good mark. <br /><br />5. Participation<br />You definitely have the chances to speak up as long as you want to as she gives a few discussion sections every class. Since law is something arguable, there’s no right or wrong answer, so you don’t need to feel embarrassed for discussing in class.<br />Just attended the class and speak up a few times and you’ll be fine.

It is also important to look through the case analysis we did during lessons as they are the similar questions that will appear in exams. Cheat sheets are allowed in the exams and it would not be that difficult.<br /><br />Projects part would also be quite important. Topics would be given randomly by slots. It would be better if you could provide a comprehensive picture of the whole topics and may provide legal case analysis if needed. Professor would provide information about what to include. However, it would be better if you could ask him the scope he would like to have in the project of the specific topics as some topics have already provided a suitable scope but some are just too wide.",

            "comment_workload": "1. In-class participation<br />There is post-class homework to be submitted on canvas almost every lesson. According to the prof, these are for students to get some participation marks even though they don't speak up during lessons. However, they are pretty demanding. Apart from your thoughts on examples discussed, sometimes you are asked to suggest some cases you have heard of and some examples. In addition, the post-class homework was not on the syllabus so we did not expect to do so much work every lesson.<br /><br />2. Three quizzes throughout the semester<br />Make sure you know the concepts for contract law. There were many traps for quiz two. <br />A side note: MCQ quizzes are in hypothetical cases. The MC choices are usually some judgement such as &quot;It is likely that side A can obtain compensation successfully due to blah blah legal principles&quot;.<br />In real life, the judgement usually depends on which argument and which evidence is presented, and how the judge thinks, but in this quiz, she is the judge so be careful and pay attention to the details of the scenarios.<br /><br />3. In-class writing assignment<br />It is for you to familiarize with the legal writing style for your individual report. Pay attention to the IRAC style. As no feedback was given, no stats released, I don't have any tips for this.<br /><br />4. Final report (individual)<br />You will be given a case, and a side (either plaintiff/defendant). You have to write a case brief, and suggest arguments and counter-arguments for your side. Brainstorming arguments can be frustrating. As it is based on a real case, your side may have lost in real life but you still have to brainstorm some arguments as it is said that &quot;there are always possibilities that benefit a side&quot; although arguing about these possibilities are not taught in class. In class, we learn from hypothetical cases that have definite answers.",
