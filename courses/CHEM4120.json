        "description": "This course will introduce the fundamental chemical principles underlying the structure, properties, and functions of biologically important molecules. Using the chemical concepts of bonding, structure, and structure-reactivity relationships developed in organic chemistry, this course will cover topics on the stereochemistry, structural diversity, physicochemical properties, and reactivity of amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids to understand the molecular basis of their biological functions. Another major topic of this course is the preparation of these important biological molecules for understanding of their functions and exploitation of their biotechnological and medicinal values, using available organic chemistry methods.",
