        "description": "This course studies types and programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective. Starting from lambda calculus, the foundation of functional programming languages, we see how to design gradually more advanced type systems following the motto “Well-typed programs do not go wrong”, meaning that types should guard us, at compilation time, from wide classes of runtime errors. Taking this principle to the extreme, we see how dependent type systems let us prove nontrivial properties of our programs, and how they relate to mathematical logic in a fundamental way. The knowledge acquired in this course has many practical applications in software engineering and computer science. It will sharpen the student’s understanding of static types in modern programming languages, as well as their ability to construct correct and reliable programs. Topics covered include lambda calculus, operational semantics, type systems, programming language theory and metatheory.",
