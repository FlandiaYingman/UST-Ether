His lecture materials were quite spontaneous as he may ask the class to pick the numbers for his example randomly. He was willing to answer student's questions in details after the lectures. TA always attended lectures, so they were quite helpful to address your enquiries regarding the course content.<br /><br />✅ His TAs provided consultation and Q&amp;A session before the final exam.<br /><br />❌ NO LECTURE NOTES AND VIDEOS!!!!<br /><br />❌ Make sure you sit at the first few rows because he did not provide lecture notes. He wrote all the contents on the whiteboard. Therefore you need to copy them. Sometimes his drawings were quite messy, and students were unable to see the numbers and details. So it would be a disadvantage sitting at the very back. Moreover, it is notable to note that Lambros demonstrate the questions at a quick pace. A mediocre student like me always found the lectures hard to follow.",

Ilias是希臘人，英文還可接受，因為CIVL major都是fall sem pre-reg, spring sem好少人讀, 最後有12個學生，但通常只有5個學生上堂。<br /><br />上第一堂的時候，他逐一詢問我們的major，有的讀CIVL、有的讀MATH、有的讀Industrial Engineering。他最後提到他的角色，只是引導我們走最快的路，用最有效的方法讀好這一科，教授並不是絕對正確的，如果學生有能力自學，不上堂也沒所謂。<br /><br />Dr. Ilias會不停問問題希望學生懂得利用反問自己來學習，他常常叫我們放膽講答案出來，&quot;Come one, don't be shy&quot;, 但呢科本身就少人讀, 加上midterm前都好簡單, 所以好多人走堂, 每次問問題，都冇學生答。<br />prof. 在乎學生是否明白concept多於擔心是否追得上進度。他又經常用自己來演示難明的concept，例如坐上桌子上解釋reaction force，走到班房門前解釋moment和torque。在解釋moment of inertia的時候<br /><br />雖然這科的上半部很簡單，但midterm後的moment of inertia，和Member Forces Diagrams有點麻煩。<br />所以到最後一堂, prof.同在坐的同學講, 呢科係midterm前好簡單, 但midterm後就會愈來愈煩. 但強調唔難, 特別係normal force, shear force, bending force diagram. 只要多做幾條題目就會知道唔難. <br /><br />呢科睇落好易, 但到做題目先會知自己concept清唔清<br />所以prof都會著重concept, 因為一錯concept就會由頭錯到落尾, 但只要concept清就一定做得到, 要做得快就要多做題目",

            "comment_teaching": "To be fair, I will say Lambros is quite enthusiastic about his teaching. I can feel that he is really trying his best to make everything clear in his lecture but I think most of the students don't really like his way of teaching and he always tried to make sure that we are all listening to his online lecture like polling, asking us to reply in the chatroom, taking attendance in lecture, forcing us to open the camera, etc. And most importantly, HE ONLY GAVE US HIS WRITTEN NOTES AFRER LECTURE AND HIS HANDWRITING AND GRAPH ARE PRETTY AWFUL. it is pretty hard to follow him in the online lecture and he will always blame us first.",

Yes. deducting 5% of overall marks. <br />midterm: 42/100 with an average of 33 and a standard deviation of 16.5<br />final: unknown<br />HW: unknown<br />and I got C+ :(",
            "comment_workload": "You have to attend all lectures and make sure on time and need to open the camera and answering every polling. Otherwise, TAs may see you as absent too :( it is quite chur for me. Lambros would ask you to watch his Coursera video before each lecture but I have never done so. Those videos are quite useful and clear in fact, sometimes they may clearer than his lecture. <br /><br />For the assignment, they are actually not difficult but always require long calculation steps. Usually, it took me 3-4 hours for doing, checking steps, and checking answers for each arm. (you can find answer of asm from chegg and source)",

However, after the mid term the teaching speed was relatively much faster.

Therefore don't give up if you get an unsatisfied result in mid-term, you still get a chance to achieve a good grade in this course. I perform so well in the mid-term exam but I forgot to do revision for the topic of question 2 of the final exam that I skipped the whole question 2. I thought I will only be able to get a B+ but turns out I get an A-. So I think the grading is ok. Attendance will not be taken every lesson, but Prof Lambros will randomly pick 2 days for quizzes. The quizzes will not be graded but will be taken as a reference for your attendance. Although we do now know the exact weighting of the quizzes, Prof. Lambros said it takes quite a heavy weighting.",

So many topics are needed to study for the exam.

            "comment_content": "This course is equivalent to the course “Mastering Statics” in Coursera, so I’ll list the topics as that in Coursera.<br /><br />Topics:<br />1. Understanding Forces and Moments (vector, moment)<br />2. Equivalent Systems of Forces and Equilibrium (reactions of different supports, free body diagram)<br />3. Stability and Static Determinacy (analyze stability from static and kinematic perspectives)<br />4. Trusses (method of joints, method of sections, computer analysis)<br />5. Area properties and Moments of Inertia (centroid, distributed loading, moment of inertia, parallel axis theorem, Mohr’s circle)<br />6. Internal Force Diagrams (axial, shear and bending moment diagrams)<br />7. Static Analysis of a Structure (combine all previous topics)<br /><br />This course isn’t difficult as it only requires basic knowledge of calculus and physics. Drawing bending moment diagram may be the hardest thing in this course. Remember BENDING MOMENT DIAGRAM is always drawn on the TENSION side!!!",
            "comment_teaching": "Lambros adopted “blended learning” mode this semester. Students are supposed to watch the online videos (which are from Coursera btw) before they attend lectures, but I doubt not many have watched them. One thing I feel confused is Lambros will repeat what he says in the videos when conducting lectures, so I guess it isn't necessary to watch the videos? <br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoy Lambros’ teaching as he explains things quite clearly and always asks students questions. (TIP: To avoid being asked, don’t sit in the back row.) The progress of this course is quite slow so I think it’s easy to catch up even you don’t understand at first glance. Overall, I appreciate Lambro’s effort to let every student understand what is going on.<br /><br />I can't say much about the TAs as I skipped most of the tutorials. (The slides are available on Canvas within a week after the tutorial.)",

I believe the quizzes are for taking attendance only, your score may not be important. The scores of final and project haven’t been released yet. The grading isn’t transparent compared to other courses.<br />(I'll update my grade soon, the grading is extremely slow)<br /><br />Update: My grade is A. It takes the teaching team a month to release the grade. I don't know my scores of the exam and project, but I think I did quite well in both of them.",
            "comment_workload": "There were 6 assignments this semester. Students had around 1 to 2 weeks to finish them. As I remember, they were identical to those in previous years. If you have source, you’ll have an easier life.<br /><br />Besides HW, attending lectures is the major workload. Lambros would give students quiz at the beginning of a lecture. The quizzes weren’t difficult though. However, Lambros gave up those quizzes after mid-October. Despite that, I still attended every lecture and I think it’s beneficial to my study.",

            "comment_content": "Statics, symbolizes the start of the structural series courses of civil engineering. This is the very first course of structural mechanics and it covers a quite in-depth content and concepts discussing the essence of the course. <br /><br />The course covers several basic ideas of structural mechanics, <br /><br />Vectors and its applications, moment of couple, equivalent systems, 2 force and 3 force systems are the main topics of first three weeks lectures. They are the basics and probably students with some basic understanding of vectors should find less difficulty digesting the lecture content. <br /><br />The following few weeks covers equilibrium of rigid body in 2D and 3D, as well as defining the stability,properties of determinate and indeterminate structures. The idea of different types of supports were also addressed. <br /><br />Trusses would be introduced in 2 weeks time and the focus would be finding 0 force members and using the method of joint and method of section in order to find the internal forces between members. <br /><br />After mid-term, the key is learning how to draw the internal force diagrams of beams and complex structures, first introducing the idea of internal force, including axial force, shear force and bending moment. The key is understanding the calculus between different diagrams and the techniques of finding out the internal force in different parts of structure when external force and moments appear, as well as to know how to draw the diagrams precisely using lines and curves. <br /><br />Finally, centroid ,center of mass,moment of inertia, parallel-axis theorem and mohr circle would be covered to find the I value of different structures and the change of I value when coordinates systems change. <br /><br />The topics included are very essential for continuing the study of structural mechanics.",
            "comment_teaching": "Prof Ilias is a Greek with some &quot;Gleek&quot; accent, but this is not a really serious matter for him to deliver the lecture content logically. He addresses the lecture content by reviewing the previous concepts learnt and proving the concepts needed in different topics, followed by demonstrating the examples to show the logic needed to solve the structural problems. He is not that kind of person just delivering the concepts mathematically and verbally, instead, he tried to deliver the concepts in an objectified manner, by randomly picking up objects in the classroom like door, tables, chairs and boxes to deliver the ideas. <br /><br /><br />With a relatively small class size(probably only 13 BOYS enrolled into the course and at most 10 BOYS attended lectures), Ilias tried to adjust the difficulty of the course content and focus more on whether students did understand the concepts well. If students had difficulties understanding, he waswilling to explain the concepts in a different way and emphazised the key again.<br /><br /><br />For tutorials, Ilias' phD student was in charge and provided some sort of reviews of the lecture content with further examples explained.",
            "comment_grading": "15% Assignments *4 <br />35% Mid Term (1hr 20 mins)<br />50% Final (3 hrs)<br />some random quizzes treated as bonus<br /><br />The assignments were a bit demanding with calculations involved, but most students scored over 90 for each assignment. The assignments were slightly difficult than the exam questions. <br /><br />The exams I would say not really difficult if you really work hard understanding the concepts and finishing the assignments hand by hand. The only problem is the exam duration were very limited even only with 4 LQs with some clumsy steps. Probably the overall difficulty of Ilias' exams, compared to the past papers prepared by Lambros, was much less demanding. <br /><br />Probably Ilias didn't follow the UG grade distribution due to the very small class size, I think he is quite generous giving out the grades if you really try your best,&nbsp;&nbsp;it's not difficult to get a good grade since some students are just REPEATERS/ NON-CIVL students. <br /><br />If you are a Year 1 student with PHYS 1112 getting a satisfactory grade, decided to get a CIVL major, willing to complete major requirements in an accelerated way and just because want to get better grades compared to students studying later, just enroll into this course with no doubt.<br /><br />Grade B+",

This all change when he go to part talking about centroid and the rest of the course which the content starts getting difficult. At that time he talked detailedly and organized to make everyone of us impressed and change our mind of having a nonsense professor all the time. <br />One thing that worth mentioning about this course is that he will do quizzes every single lectures (although he got bored at the end and skip some quizzes). It required you to be on time and sit for the whole lecture because you don't know when the quiz will start. <br />The quiz is only for attendance so no study is needed.<br /><br />But at least in the end, everyone loves him &lt;3.<br />Lambros hurray~~~~",

            "comment_teaching": "Overall, I can conclude prof Lambros lecture with only one word: AWFUL🐶<br /><br />It is because Prof Lambros made his lecture mandatory but his lecture notes were pointless that made students hard to follow. Worse still, he doesn't have any well-written or organised lecture notes(PowerPoint or Pdf)for students to revise before the exam. So,many students didn't made enough preparations and practice in the run-up to the exam .As a result ,the exam results were always disastrous(mean around 30 out of 100).For my experience,I learn this course all from Youtube by watching the example and do the practice for drawing Shear,axial and bending moment diagram.<br /><br />If u are following prof Lambros teaching schedule,u must be under-prepared for the final exam because he taught the most important topic: axial, shear, bending moment diagram exactly 1 week before the final exam and with very little and easy examples.U will find yourself lost and puzzled in the sign convention,how to draw the diagram when u revise the topic. To make the situation even worse, there are no tutorial notes for u to practice on because it was during the study period when prof Lambros just started to introduce this important topic which will appear in future like graduate job interview, future CIVL course",
