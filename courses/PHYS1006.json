However, the first few chapters cover things like different theories and history of how people think of the universe, also some conceptual physics like Newtonian law, properties of light, and temperature. Not that many calculations nor memorization of words and terms, more into understanding the concepts, so I think it's still ok to take despite not having a background in physics.",
            "comment_teaching": "The professor is kind and willing to answer students' questions but can be boring at times. He provides different multimedia in his ppt so it's easier to understand the new concepts explained. Listen to him during class so you don't miss out on some important remarks that can be important or will help you understand things more easily. I definitely recommend watching Crash Course's Astronomy playlist on youtube. Most classes will have iprs in the middle or in the end of the lesson, some classes would have a short discussion in breakout rooms (abt 10 mins).",

Cosmology <br />12. Life in the Universe (wrapped up within 30 minutes, not tested in the final exam)<br /><br />There are consistent minor errors in the PPT slides. Insufficient explanations are given during the lectures towards the end of course due to limited time. Sometimes the questions on PRS are not clearly stated (or has implicit connections to the materials on the PPT). Some contents on PPT are ambiguously written, irritating to read. <br /><br />No supplementary reference is suggested by the professor. It is understandable that the summer term is short and the course must proceed at a fast pace, but the professor should not directly copy online Pearson teaching materials (minimal modifications) and test bank questions. Self-Test questions are also pathetically copied from the test bank. Students therefore may have to depend on external learning resources in order to fully understand the contents.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Chen rushes too much and constantly relies on PPT slides (because summer term is short, I suppose). However, he does pause and elaborate on the contents if they are important or bound to show up on the exams.<br /><br />Because the professor did not major in astronomy, he sometimes may not be able to answer some questions from the students. However, he usually looks for the answers after class and informs the students either by email or during the next lecture. In terms of this, professor Chen is passionate about teaching.",

The final total score of around 94/100 will be a solid A+ (not sure about other grade boundaries). It should be a straightforward course if one has studied astronomy / astrophysics. <br /><br />Note: After the final, I have discovered that more than 80% of the questions (I cannot speak of 100% because I do not remember all the questions) from PRS, Mid Term and Final are directly copied from an online test bank that is all over the internet (probably The Cosmic Perspective, 7th edition, which is the reference textbook for PHYS 1002). Professor Chen should have used the test bank that is not readily accessible by students. I personally dislike such petty and lazy way of designing exams, and therefore I am giving a B for grading.",
            "comment_workload": "In my opinion, the course is not an effective introductory course. Students who have not previously studied astronomy (regardless of whether they have taken introductory physics classes before) may have to spend some time in researching the materials on PPT as it lacks adequate explanations and omits necessary details, particularly towards the last chapters.<br /><br />For newcomers in astronomy/astrophysics, I recommend doing some peripheral reading on The Physical Universe By Frank Shu prior to taking the course. It is a thorough introductory reference that is even readable by high school students.",
