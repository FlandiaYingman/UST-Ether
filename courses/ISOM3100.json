An overview on the game is also given.<br /><br />Before the real game starts, a few weeks are spent on the practice rounds to give students a taste of how the game is like, and as a warm up for those who need some time to familiarize themselves with the game. The game is played against fellow student teams in the class. There were 3 practice rounds in Spring 2017 - not sure if the number is different in other semesters.<br /><br />The real game lasts for 8 rounds. In the first few rounds, students have more time to make decisions for the game. However, the decision making time is reduced gradually - only 1 hour was given for the decisions in round 8 when compared to a full week in round 1. As the game proceeds, the game becomes more and more challenging.",

While going through the lectures, he introduced a lot of discussions to help us apply the strategies. The lectures are not just useful in business field, but can be useful in other areas as well. He is also very responsive to questions.",

In this particular semester, the game alone took up 50% of the course grade - 10% from the practice rounds and 40% from the competition rounds. This part is a zero-sum game - you are literally graded against your competitors in the game. It is almost when you gain one point, the others lose one point. This can be frustrating when you are on the disadvantaged side.<br /><br />If your team is not performing well (no matter because of bad luck or bad strategy), hopefully the rest of the 50% can save your grades - 20% for a simple group presentation, 20% for attendance, class participation and online quiz (if you finish it, you gain full credits, don't worry - it's more like an assignment to make sure you know the game rules), and 10% for 2 written assignments.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload depends on your commitment. The group presentations and written assignments are easy. When working on the written assignments the hardest part is to keep my work within 4 pages (double-spaced). <br /><br />However, the workload for the game varies a lot - you can choose to randomly come up with some decisions and put them into the system, or scrutinize the game financial reports, do a lot of calculations and carefully plan your actions. <br /><br />Good news: no exams!",
