        "description": "This course will introduce students to the fundamental dynamics that drive successful team performance. Today in whatever organization we work in we are expected to work in a team structure. In some cases we work in teams that meet face to face, in others we need to work with people who we may never meet physically and only over the phone or video. In both situations understanding what drives effective collaboration and performance is critical. Unfortunately few leaders and organisations are well-prepared to lead or to participate well in teams. This is due to a combination of factors related to the way people are used to interacting with each other in groups, cultural differences, personality diversity and emotional needs. This course will cover all of those areas using a mix of the latest management theory on team performance, Harvard case studies and online simulations, competitive experiential group exercises, classroom discussions and individual personality assessments. Students completing this course will not only learn substantially about team leadership but also about how to develop their own capabilities as future leaders",
