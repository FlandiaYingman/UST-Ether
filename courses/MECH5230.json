            "comment_teaching": "It is evident that she does not understand the material she is teaching. When asked simple follow-up questions about the powerpoint slides, she cannot answer. This is because she has copied a textbook almost word-for-word for its content and for its images. Due to this poor teaching, the class started the semester being a dynamic, vibrant, and fun place to learn and ended the semester with every student in the class not bothering to ask questions because she cannot answer them. That is the greatest pity. Therefore, feel free to take any other CFD class because you will not learn much. <br /><br />The lecture notes are quite sufficient to understand the point but sometimes the professor shows an example or derives a formula.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is lenient as it is a graduate class. <br /><br />Homework - 60% (so each assignment is worth 20% of your grade)<br />Presentation - 20%<br />Report - 20%",
            "comment_workload": "There are 3 assignments, one each month, as well as one final project and its corresponding presentation. <br /><br />You can choose the subject of your presentation. The professor prefers microfluidic problems but she also accepts purely hydrodynamic problems too. <br /><br />The assignments are deceptively simple. You must implement the various schemes taught in class in any software you would like (MATLAB and ANSYS Fluent are popular). The questions are simple but they require understanding of the software to implement your scheme correctly. There are also a large number of schemes you must implement. Therefore, the difficulty of the assignments come from the repetition rather than nuance. <br /><br />The final project's difficulty is up to you. You must write up a 6-page report and give a 10 minute presentation on your project.",
