One is just knowledge part, such as concepts of Data mining, Database Administration. For me, I think the diffcult part would be the technical part. Drawing disgram and Writing programming is actually quite hard for some students since business students are generally not good in this aspect. The concepts learnt in ISOM3210 and 3230 would definietly be helpful in dealing with this course. The course content is actually quite useful when you are dealing IT related jobs in futures. (Personally, I think it would be better to include more topics about open source database.)<br /><br />SQL should spend the most time to learn. ERD and normalisation just be careful of the logic behind and some minor stuff.",
            "comment_teaching": "Muller and Chris taught the content is a quite good way. Although attendance is not required, they suggested it was good to attend and I did agree with them. It would be better to listen to what they said in lessons. There are something they would explicitly mention during lectures and tutorials.

He is always well-prepared in lectures, and can explain concepts in a clear, understandable, structured and detailed way. If this is a required course for you, then you should register Mr. Cheung's class.<br />For the TA Samuel, IS students should be familiar with him. He is a cute guy and knowledgable in this area. However, he is always busy, so you should try asking all your questions in labs, otherwise it would be hard to find him....",
            "comment_grading": "Totally shit...<br />This semester, our assessments are:<br />40% - Project (Demonstration+Code+Final Report)<br />30% - 3 Assignments<br />30% - Inclass submissions, Online submissions (which are before each lecture), Lab submissions<br /><br />I guess everyone can get full mark in all the submissions and receive similar scores in assignments. So, our final grade totally depends on the project. And the problem is that, this should be an SQL course, but the project is actually testing your Python skills instead of proficiency in SQL (which I think is extremely unreasonable). We had to build the user interface in Python and the TA only gave us little reference Python code that was far from enough. I would say you can only receive an F if you solely relied on the TA's code. <br />And unfortunately, my group only had 5 people (other groups had 6-7 people), and most of us weren't familiar with Python. Our group tried really really hard, but I still received C range in the end that pulled down my grade a lot.<br /><br />So my suggestions are: 1. Don't take this course; 2. Find good groupmates; 3. Be proficient in Python.",

You will have a taste of drawing ER Model with Toad Data Modeler in a tutorial session.<br />You will also learn a programming language (SQL) that allows you to build a database with Oracle Forms, manipulate it and retrieve data from it. <br />I personally think this course is the most practical and all-rounded IS course of all.",

The exercise he provided is sufficient for exams preparation. If you are not confident with some topics (for me, it's writing SQL subqueries) you can also find Muller after class or in his office. He can understand your struggles and teach you in another way that you will eventually get it.<br /><br />Samuel is a SUPER knowledgeable and friendly TA. He is an expert of programming. You should pay a lot of attention in his tutorials, though each session lasts for 3 hrs :( , as he speaks almost no bullshit. Everything he taught in the tutorials is gonna help you with your project. Try to test your program as much as you can, because he is so experienced that he can always spot bugs and tell you which part you can improve to make your systems more user-friendly.",

It should not be a problem, as long as you can do the exercise given by Muller and Samuel on your own. <br /><br />**Tips for final: Be focus when you are transforming the ER diagram to relations and be careful of the answer format in the Normalization, or you may miss out some points. SQL is the BIG BOSS. Make sure you save enough time to do the last part of the paper.",
            "comment_workload": "This course is infamous for its heavy workload. You are going to build a database system (tea shop point-of-sale system) from scratch with 6 groupmates. Only computers in G005 are equipped with SQL Tool and Oracle Forms, so you can only work on the project when the lab is available, usually on weekends, or you may try to sneak into the lab while people are having other lessons (if you are not kicked out). Our group divided the job evenly and we have no previous knowledge of SQL at the beginning (I suppose). None of us is free-rider, but still, we ended up staying at G005 every night and every weekend. <br /><br />**tips 1: Start the project ASAP! After you have learned how to draw ER model, draw it for your project right away! Better to leave more time to the end to combine your works, test the final product and debug.<br />**tips 2: Sources from previous students might help a little. You can refer to their codes and user interface if necessary but it is not possible to copy their system entirely because no two systems are the same. <br />**tips 3: Separate the job evenly. Do not put all the burden on one groupmate who seems to be better at programming. Not only he/she is going to hate you and score you low in peer evaluation, it is very obvious when you cannot answer Samuel's questions in progress demonstration.",

So make sure you learn both effectively. <br /><br />For the project, you will need to use 3 software programs, Toad Data Modeler, SQLTools and Oracle Forms. Get familiarized with them asap as the can be confusing to use at the start. <br /><br />Toad Data Modeler will be used mainly at the start of the semester to build the ER diagram. <br />Then you will need to use Oracle Forms to build the actual interface of the database and SQLTools for data validation, testing, debugging etc. <br /><br />This course can be quite challenging at times if you're not a technical person so it is imperative that you put extra effort into it. Depending on your groupmates' preferences, you can work on the ER diagram, project reports and build the easier functions for the database. If you can get the help of people who are experienced in SQL, that will be very helpful as you can get your work done faster rather than spending ages trying to figure out what is wrong in your code.",
            "comment_teaching": "As mentioned in other reviews, Muller is a great professor and he is very helpful. <br /><br />I have sat even in James's classes and he is also pretty good. He tends to explain in a more conversational way and expects students to actually do the exercises beforehand as he will ask volunteers to do the exercises on the board. Whereas Muller would solve it in class one by one. <br /><br />Samuel is a great TA and he explains very well. He has been teaching this course for years now so pay attention to the tips he'd give for the project.",
            "comment_grading": "Project accounts a large percentage of the grade, so you need to work hard and contribute as much as possible. There will be 2 peer evaluations in the semester, the 2nd one will affect your final project score. Make sure you form a good group as you'll need to meet your teammates frequently throughout the semester. <br /><br />The midterm and final are more or less straightforward, just do the assigned exercises thoroughly and understand the lecture content well and you'd be just fine.",
            "comment_workload": "You'd probably know by now. The course is extremely heavy in workload. The reason being that the software that needs to be used for this project is only available in the lab computers. A few people managed to install the software on their personal computers/ laptops. Samuel will probably tell you the details about it in the lab, but this method can be very difficult as personal laptops don't have the processing power required to handle these software programs.<br /><br />Expect to work on the project about 2-3 times a week assuming nobody in your group has any SQL background and towards the project demo, you could literally be coming everyday to the lab to work on it. I'd advise you do this course in a semester where you don't have other challenging courses or else your workload will be too much too handle. Otherwise if you can manage to do this course on your Exchange, please do so and avoid the pain that you'd potentially need to experience at UST. <br /><br />Get started on the project once the ER diagram concepts have been taught as this will form the foundation for the rest of your project. There will be 2 project demonstrations in the semester, so as they draw closer, the labs would be full and hard to secure a good computer as some barely work. Plus the lab tends to stink quite bad cuz of the number of people inside and food :P",

In our semester, the deadline was postponed since everyone request for more time to work on it.

            "comment_content": "This is an introductory course to database design and administration and this is also one the required courses for the IS major. <br /><br />The course content covers topics like entity-relationship diagrams, SQL (mostly data definition language and data manipulation language), transformation of relations, normalisation, data, and database administration.<br /><br />The content is chosen appropriately for beginners to database design, and the topics build upon each other therefore it is important to understand each of the modules thoroughly so that you are not confused in the subsequent chapters. There is a recommended textbook, and while it is not necessary, I would recommend trying to obtain a copy of it as the book does give additional explanations on topics which may be useful to clarify any doubts you may have.",
            "comment_teaching": "I would say that Muller (Prof. Cheung)'s teaching style is excellent. I really enjoyed all of his lectures, and I found that he presented all of the content extremely clearly and used examples were relevant to elaborate on any points and to illustrate the theories. He was also very to-the-point, such that he doesn't spend time talking about topics that aren't assessed. I would advise you to go to all of the lectures because they are extremely useful and can help you to consolidate your understanding. There are also exercises provided after every chapter so that you can test your own understanding of the topic, and these are very useful when preparing for the exams. Although the lectures are almost 2 hours (there's only one lecture a week), Muller does provide breaks in between so that you have some time to stretch your legs. That being said, don't sign up for the evening lecture if you're prone to feeling sleepy on a Friday evening. :)<br /><br />I think most IS major students have had Samuel as a TA during their time at UST, so I won't spend too long commenting on the lab sections. The lab duration is 3 hours as indicated in the class schedule, however, Samuel only teaches for the first 1.5 hours and the remainder of the time is for you to work on your project (DO actually work on your project as this time is super valuable and you can also ask Samuel for any help with issues you may have). I will say that for implementing some of the project functionality, you may have to go beyond what is taught in lectures and the lab sessions.",
            "comment_grading": "The course grading scheme includes:<br /><br />— Lab Submissions (6%)<br />— Project (33%)<br />— Midterm Exam (26%)<br />— Final Exam (35%)<br /><br />The grading is relatively fair, although the final project score was not released therefore I cannot comment on how this component is graded.<br /><br />The midterm exam covers the first four chapters, and in this semester, the mean was around 80/100 with an SD of 8. The final exam is non-cumulative and focuses on the topics taught after the midterm. The mean for the final exam was around 69/100 with an SD of 11.<br /><br />The grading for the project is a bit unclear, however, most groups receive pretty much the same score for the progress demonstration (as told by Samuel, the TA). I will say that the project can influence your grade significantly, so I would not recommend taking it lightly (I'll elaborate on this in the Workload section).",
            "comment_workload": "This is a 4-credit course, and the majority of the workload comes from the project. Although the case may vary each semester, it typically involves building some sort of database system for a company and implementing various functions for the end user as specified in the project brief. The software for working on the project (mainly Oracle Forms Developer and SQLTools) is only available in G005, and as the demonstration deadlines approach, it's near impossible to find a free computer (so go early and claim a bunch of desktops if you want to be a deadline fighter). In addition, collaboration is also quite tough therefore you'll be doing a LOT of compiling of different versions in addition to all the debugging (debug very thoroughly, because you'll get caught out in the demonstration if you don't do this). I would also recommend finding groupmates who have strong coding skills as this may make it easier for you to do the SQL coding when building the forms, and a small mistake in the code can take you ages to figure out so be careful.<br /><br />Aside from the project, there isn't a lot of additional workload. Although Muller provides exercises for each topic, he usually dedicates part of the lecture time to working on these and walking you through the answer, so you don't necessarily have to do them before class (unless you just really want to test your database knowledge immediately after the class).",

Therefore, students are always confused with the requirements.
