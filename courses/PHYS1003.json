            "comment_content": "The content is pointless and disorganized. You are intended to learn about physics related to energy production and related issues, but the content is a crap of mess that I learn nothing useful at the end of semester. In this course, you’ll learn some thermodynamics, DSE physics (E3 module especially) and some social-related issues which are freaking pointless.<br /><br />===Syllabus (In lecture no.)===<br />1. Introduction<br />2. Energy consumption &amp; Population growth<br />3. Fossil fuels<br />4. Temperature &amp; Heat<br />5~6. Thermodynamics of heat engines <br />7. Otto engine &amp; Passenger cars<br />8. Diesel engine &amp; Cargo ships<br />9. Jet engine &amp; Air travel<br />-----Mid-Term (Lecture 1~9)-----<br />11. Electricity generation<br />12. Electricity power grid<br />13. Electric lighting<br />14. Energy storage &amp; Home heating<br />15. Embodied energy in stuff<br />16~17. Nuclear energy<br />18. Water energy<br />19. Wind energy<br />20. Solar energy<br />21. Air pollution<br />22. Global warming &amp; Climate change<br />-----Final (Lecture 11~22)-----<br /><br />===Lecture Slides===<br />Let’s start with lecture slides. The slides are full of filler like whole slide of data tables (expect one for every few slides), pointless graphs and stock photos. To make things worse, they examine those filler tables and graphs in the mid-terms and finals. They seriously asked whether wind turbines kill more birds than cats and cars in the mid-term...<br /><br />The slides also contains some typos, including missing variables in important equations and typos of scientist names like “Telsa”. The professors just freaking cram all the related information, no matter whether it’s useful or not, into the slides. So what you have at the end of the day is a slide full of filler in every few slide, some key points placed besides images scraped from Google and some formulas you need to know.<br /><br />===How far this course derailed from its objectives===<br />Since this is common core, I get that professors want to add social issues to the course. But they FAIL miserably. Instead of trying to let us understand how important renewable energies really are, or how physics is related to everyday life, professors just stuff all the related data into lecture slides and expect magic happens. They lazily stuff factual and trivial information under HK and China context, and read the data from the tables. To be honest, I learn very little knowledge at the end. What I DID learn is how to make a cheatsheet though :)<br /><br />===How professors lie to get you in===<br />In the first lecture, they claim “This is not a physics course. This is a course about using numbers, not adjectives”. THIS IS A BIG F*CKING LIE!!! They straight up jumped to teaching thermodynamics right after the add-drop period. In fact, I would say 75% of content are physics related so I don't know why the professor lied in the first place.",
            "comment_teaching": "Professor Wong Kam Sing is the one of the SHITTIEST lecture you’ll meet in your UST years. Other lecturers are not going to be that good either. But please avoid Wong’s timeslots.<br /><br />===Shit English===<br />His English is so full Hong Kong accent and stuttering that it’s really hard to compile a sentence from his words. He just pronounces some English words half the way through and repeats his last word while thinking. This results in masterpieces like:<br />Pronouncing “government” as “garment”<br />Pronouncing “ship” as “shit” (yes that’s true)<br />Pronouncing “flux” as “f*ck”<br /><br />He also speaks in a weird intonation that he loves to raise the tone of the last word in the sentence. So sometimes he’ll break his voice at the end of sentence and it’s so funny. To be honest we are not expecting your English to be top-notch but at least make it understandable... So, expect majority of the class falling asleep or doing their own stuff half way through the lesson. <br /><br />===Shit Teaching===<br />He just fail to explain concepts clearly. He just reads from the slides when &quot;teaching&quot; thermodynamics. He expects you have some background knowledge and straight up teaching super quickly and didn’t explain new stuff such (He successfully crammed two PHYS1112 lectures into one lecture).<br /><br />He just read off slides just as we are blind. He even has got to the point of reading data out of data tables! Overall, he’s just very not enthusiastic and sometimes yell to students who are chatting with their friends. Please read your PHYS1111/PHYS1112 notes instead.",
            "comment_grading": "Not gonna lie, this course is really good grade which kinda surprises me when the final grading is out. You can get A grade if your mid-term and exam is 1 SD above mean :)<br /><br />===Distribution===<br />Mid-Term: 45%<br />Final: 55%<br />Bonus PRS questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;5%<br /><br />===Statistics===<br />Mid-Term:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean - 142.2/200 ; SD - 25.2<br />Final:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean - 254 ; SD - 63 <br /><br />===My Marks===<br />Mid-Term: 172/200 (+1.2SD)<br />Final: 303/400 (+0.77SD)<br />PRS Bonus: 5/5<br />Grade: A<br /><br />===Test Papers Rules===<br />The tests are so BADLY-WRITTEN that you’ll feel angry. <br />You can bring one A-4 cheatsheet in both mid-term and final and the tests are not cumulative. For both mid-term and final, there are MC questions and long questions.<br /><br />For MC, you’ll get 5 marks for correct answer, but deduct 1 mark per incorrect attempt (zero marks for no attempt though). They also give step marks very strictly in LQ generally. They will give no marks if you got something wrong in steps.<br /><br />{Side Note: This rule generally applies if the test paper is not too difficult. It applied to the mid-term paper but the final paper was more lenient since final exam is hell}<br /><br />===Shitty Questions===<br />The professors love to challenge us by NOT PUTTING important information in test papers to torture our souls.<br /><br />For my mid-term exam, they PURPOSELY didn’t put the conversion between calorie and joules. They expect you to have this seemingly important information that the question will provide in your cheatsheet! I even asked the TAs to provide us the conversion but they refused. They say “We want to test your unit conversion so we didn’t add that”. F*ck that! If I cannot convert units, I’m still not going to calculate anything correctly if you provide “1 calorie = 4.18J” in the question! This question had become a test of how good your cheatsheets are, instead of how good your unit conversion skills are.<br /><br />The final is just a train wreck. They expect you to know that the noble gas with atomic number 54 is Xenon. Really? Now they expect us to put a f*cking periodic table in my cheatsheet. <br /><br />And the long questions occupying half of the total marks are so painfully difficult that no one I know can do all of them. They copied a stupid weird graph from Google and expect us to work out figures from that graph. I only know how to do 1 out of 4 LQs but still managed to get 127/200 marks… (I'm really surprised) Probably you may wanna write as much stuff as possible to bet they give you step marks.<br /><br />===PRS Bonus Questions===<br />The professors know that if they didn’t add PRS question to end of every lesson, no one will be attending. They will ask a question at the end of each lesson. Those are pretty easy and you can answer them correctly even though you didn’t pay attention in the whole lesson.<br /><br />Every correct answer scores 1 mark, 0.5 mark for incorrect and 0 mark for not answering.<br /><br />===Advice===<br />The only good thing about this course is that it's really good grade. If you score 1 SD above mid-term and final and get nearly all the bonus PRS marks then you should have A- or A. Of course, you have to be confident that you don't screw up your tests.<br /><br />I have a friend who got 1.8 SD above mean in mid-term but 0.3 SD above mean in final and he got A-. So the moral of story is don't screw up your final",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is also very light, almost to the point of none. There are homework for self-practice and not credit bearing. The only workload you’ll get is making cheatsheet and doing exercises. If you have sources, making cheatsheet shouldn’t be a huge problem.<br /><br />===Conclusion===<br />I just don’t understand how come such a crappy course is a school sponsored common core course. Probably most of the money UST had given ends up in professors’ pockets ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<br /><br />This course doesn't give you insights and knowledge. The only thing it gives you is good grades if you do well. Nothing more than that. F*ck this course",

            "comment_content": "This is a school-sponsored common course course (S&amp;T) and&nbsp;&nbsp;the course only allows students with previous knowledge of Physics (DSE) to enroll in. The content covered in this course includes a wide range of aspects but students find difficulty to figure out the linkage between each topic. <br /><br />You will find out the course is a nightmare since you will get faked by the professor, saying that &quot; this is not a physics course&quot;.<br /><br />The topics covered in the mid-term exam include population growth, heat, thermodynamics, engines of vehicles and ships, and flying(mentioning the flying principles and Bernouli equation). Previous knowledge of thermodynamics covered in PHYS1112 (General Physics I with Calculus) is recommended for this course since the concepts are just the same. The PowerPoint slides are just a piece of mess and provide limited explanation of the relevant concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to know the functions and the mechanisms of each cycle and just to apply the calculation into practice. Some strange calculations are included in the first few lectures. <br /><br />The final exam includes much more topics, but students should get familiar if they studied such concepts in detail during DSE. Some E&amp;M concepts learnt in DSE are included, while the content learnt in DSE- E3 are covered. Such topics include nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, wind,solar and hydro power, electrical lighting , pollution and global warming. However you should be careful that there are some calculations required for clear understanding. <br /><br />The powerpoint slides are just too messy and involve lots of unnecessary data, information and pictures which are not examined during examinations. The slides are generally arranged in a chaotic way and it is recommended to figure out the key concepts, operating mechanisms of different energy type and reactions and key calculations in each slide to prepare for making of your own cheatsheet for examinations. <br /><br />But please spend some days before the exams to identify the content covered during the boring lectures and prepare for the cheatsheet which requires you to be familiar with periodic table, unit conversion,calculus etc.",

The lectures are just too boring and useless. <br />The professor shows lots of hesitation and uncertainties during lectures since he fails to speak in a fluent and proper manner. His broken and Hong-Kong style English makes him difficult to grab students attention and arouse interest. His pronunciation is flat and plain without any intonation and stress, as well as he fails to read a word correctly. It seems he didn't prepare for the lectures and speak in a chaotic and unorganized way. International students will probably find difficulty to understand what he is trying to speak since he is just a local, like local who doesn't know English. <br /><br />Examples of poor English: <br />This is a large &quot;shit&quot; -&gt; ship <br />The petrol &quot;unging&quot; -&gt; engine <br />Power &quot;pan1&quot; -&gt; plant <br /><br />Students recommend the professor to make a IELTS attempt to judge his English speaking ability and improve English.<br /><br />Overall, Wong Kam Sing this terrible guy, please don't teach anymore, go and have your research or practice your English before you are getting into the coffin. <br /><br />He is just a mean,rude,nonsense and irresponsible guy. Do no preparation before lectures, being rude to his MPhil TAs and IAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the students who were coming just for the PRS.<br /><br />Prof 黃錦聖 講野根本組織唔到，應該有語癌要揾言語治療師治理",
            "comment_grading": "The grading is generally shit. <br />For MC questions, a correct answer rewards 5 marks , no mark given for unattempted questions. <br />However you should realise that a one-mark penalty will be given to a wrong MC answer, which can be humiliated and painful if you get too many questions wrong. If you find difficulty to identify the answer just don't answer the question to secure marks. <br /><br />Generally students get proper marks and even you are slightly below mean in mid-term, try to score higher marks and your grade will probably get secured. <br /><br />The lectures are generally boring and the professors with poor English try to grab attentions from students, so they adopt PRS in each lecture. The PRS questions are generally easy and if you attend the lectures with your friends, just spend your time on other stuff and wait for the PRS response. <br /><br />General marking scheme: <br />Mid term 45%<br />Final 55% <br />PRS during lectures additional 5%<br />1 mark for correct option 0.5 mark for wrong option no mark for unattempt<br /><br />Grade: B+",

            "comment_content": "Content is fragmented, extremely wide, and not that informative. If you have a passing interest in the topic, you probably are aware of significant portions of the course, barring the scientific concepts and formulae. A large portion of the content is irrelevant overall (meaning basically every table, graph, or case study) and can be skipped. The content isn't too much nor too complex, and in the end, having little content isn't that bad - it helps it all fit on your cheat sheet.<br /><br />As a note, if you don't fully understand it already, the thermodynamics section will probably not make much sense. At least not if you have the world's worst substitute come in. Just learn it from Hyperphysics - it's far better at explaining. Don't bother worrying about why the formulae work either, it'll just waste your time. (I hate not knowing these things, and this bothered me a lot, but was the best decision. Adiabatic formulae are terrible.)<br /><br />And seriously. Ignore the tables. If you get the rambling professor I did, nothing he says is useful. You don't need to waste your precious cheat sheet space on writing down that Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves or whatever. No one cares about the Chinese infrastructure projects - they'll give you different case studies in the exam anyway.",
            "comment_teaching": "Teaching was the worse part of this course. If you can't write good cheat sheets, or require good teachers to properly learn, this course is not for you. The teacher barely explained anything useful, and instead spends his time on irrelevant things. He teaches in a very boring manner - the most exciting moment in class I remember was when I got a PRS question wrong and he explained it. It wasn't exciting, which says a lot. I nearly fell asleep in these lessons, even when I wasn't tired in other ones.<br /><br />He'll spend 10 minutes reading out a table and explaining every single thing you can extrapolate from it (which barely showed up in the exam beyond some general trends mentioned elsewhere) or spend five minutes writing out a complicated formula from beginning to end (when none of the intermediate steps are useful), and then skip straight past the concepts that might be confusing. Some of these concepts were not relevant, which makes me question why he bothered including them at all. <br /><br />As an example, microstates were mentioned once in relation to entropy. They were not explained at all; not what a microstate is nor what counts as a separate microstate. Before the exam, I checked the homework, and the singular question on microstate was thus confusing. I panicked a bit - I had no clue what these were and the internet wasn't being cooperative. In the end, after meeting with the TAs, it turned out that this wasn't necessary anyway.<br /><br />The substitute we got for the two hardest lessons (thermodynamics) was the worst teacher I've ever had. Incomprehensible, useless, and incapable of explaining anything properly. His idea of explaining how formula changed was &quot;and then you use calculus&quot; or &quot;with some math&quot;, ignoring important parts like the necessary substitution. He's just... bad.<br /><br />Overall, expect bad time management, a lack of explanation in class (but go seek out the TAs, they're actually good at explaining things and will help) and boring lessons.",
            "comment_grading": "Despite the bad ratings in the other two categories, I would actually recommend this course to anyone wanting some SSC S&amp;T credits. Because it's not that hard. The final exam mean was 254/400, SD of 63. I got 349, an A. Why? The cheat sheet. In this course, your cheat sheet is your best friend. Because you can fit everything relevant on those two sides you get to bring in to the exam - I didn't do any memorization studying, merely a quick reread of the slides before the exam, and still got an A. Good thing about the final is that it is non-cumulative; nothing before the mid-term matters.The mid-term was similarly easy, although I don't remember the grades. I did get an A with the same strategy, though.<br /><br />Oh, and in addition, the PRS grades are a bonus mark in this course. 45% midterm, 55% final, 5% extra bonus for PRS. And they are easy enough you can get at least 75% right, giving an extra ~4% overall.",
            "comment_workload": "Not much to say here. No homework, no assignment, no attendance&nbsp;&nbsp;needed even, as the PRS grade is a bonus. The disjointed and wide nature of the course means that after the midterm, nothing really relates to anything else. So skipping a lesson won't affect your ability to understand the next lesson. The only work is the cheat sheets, which for me just involved going through all the lesson notes and combining what seemed important.",

People say it's very similar to DSE PHY E3, still, the content can be easily picked up by anyone from any background, again, except thermodynamics. If you've studied PHYS1112 then you'll roll through that portion, albeit with some minor differences in sign and notation that may confuse you initially.<br /><br />Honestly, since they got rid of the final exam this semester, I stopped taking notes during lectures after the midterm (around when they were on water power) and worked on the project in the lecture theatre instead. If they keep the same arrangement in future semesters, I'd recommend doing so as well to save some time.",

Be clear on what unit the parameters are in and what they stand for. You need to plug many numbers into the equations, which can easily lead to mistakes. I have plugged in the wrong values and even missed parameters. Side rant, they designed the midterm such that all information and subquestions for a problem were grouped and given blank pages to answer on. It was inconvenient to flip back and forth to get the info for your formulas.<br /><br />► Group project report 25%<br />► Poster presentation 25%<br />(A casual convention-like event, not the traditional everyone looks at you kind of presentation, see workload section for detail)<br />• Project total score statistics: Mean 89.34; Median 90.74; LQ 86.8; UQ 95; The scores are very tight<br />• My group got 97.7/100 and seeing how tight the distribution is, I reckon the midterm is much more deterministic for the grade<br /><br />► Question of the day 10% (See workload section for detail)<br />The three lowest scoring QotD will be dropped<br /><br />I got A- in the end, and it seems like the midterm is much more deterministic of the final grade given that you don't do the project haphazardly",
            "comment_workload": "Question of the day after every lecture, but unlike iPRS, you do not need to be present at the lecture theatre and just submit the Canvas quiz before the deadline. These are very simple and easy to complete.<br /><br />Homework questions are for preparing for the midterm only, no submission is required but is highly recommended, especially for the thermodynamics topics.<br /><br />Then there's the group project. 5-page report (+some pages for figures and references) plus an A1 poster. Sounds easy, but the execution feels like a mess (at least in my mind, whereas my teammates are not stressed at all).<br /><br />The project proposal was submitted before the midterm, and you have a month to finish the report. In reality, they took a long time to give feedback on your proposal on Canvas, and still, their feedback wasn't helpful and didn't remind us that our scope is too broad and wouldn't be ideal for the short report. My advice is to not wait for that and approach the instructor directly so that you could work on the report early.<br /><br />For someone who hasn't worked on a report before, I feel like they didn't give enough pointers on how it should be written early enough, up until one week before the report submission when they did the project consultation during the lecture. Only at that point, our group realised we had too many research questions and had to restructure and rewrite the majority of the report. It would've been much better had they conducted the project consultation earlier, or moved the content to the project briefing session.<br /><br />Lastly, the A1 poster and poster presentation. We had two days after the project report deadline to design and submit the softcopy of the poster, which is a summary of each part of the report. My advice is to have it in point form, with fewer and larger words and more graphics, so that it is more interesting and easier to read. And if you are willing to pay $80, you can get the A1 poster professionally printed at the MTPC print shop (Room 3104, lift 2). Otherwise, you could just stick multiple A4s together.<br /><br />The poster presentation session is more like a casual convention than one group presenting in front of the entire class. All groups put up their posters in the lecture theatre, and then instructors and TAs will randomly come to your poster and ask questions. One groupmate stands by the poster while the others walk around the theatre visiting other groups. You do not need to memorise a script, just be familiar with your report, or just pull up the document on your phone when needed. Be relaxed and see what others have done.",

            "comment_content": "Before the midterm, the course covers the principles behind energy production. There will be around 4 lectures covering heat (pdV work, gas pressure, heat engines and refrigerators etc), which is the most challenging part of the entire course. If you have taken PHYS1112 before this course, you should be quite familiar with these concepts. If you have no PHYS1112 background, be prepared to spend more time understanding and drilling those parts before the midterm exam since it may be challenging to understand them the first time. Knowledge from the heat unit of HKDSE may be helpful. <br />After the midterm, the focus shifts to introducing different types of energy. Knowledge from EM and radiation of HKDSE may be helpful. The course was wrapped up by going through some environmental impacts of general energy production on the world.<br />Overall, the course covers quite a wide range of knowledge that we may not have known about energy and energy production. I also feel myself being more aware of the environment quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from an exam-oriented point of view, I experienced difficulty finding the focus of the course and each topic, so I won't know what to put on the cheat sheets and what to revise more. To conclude, it's basically an ENVS course that tests physics things. Take it if you are interested in both.<br />Please refer to the attached course schedule or other reviews for the list of topics taught.",
            "comment_teaching": "This is Prof. Jaeck's first semester and first course at HKUST. Perhaps because of that, he values our feedback a lot. He has a thing called the &quot;exit ticket&quot;, which is an anonymous and non-compulsory survey we fill out at the end of every lesson. We can rate his lecture, ask questions and give constructive opinions there, and he would read our feedback and make suitable changes in teaching style. You can already tell how much of a devoted and passionate instructor he is from this. He tried really hard to keep his lectures entertaining, by sharing his personal encounters in Germany, showing us videos that he found, 1-2-3 GO! games (which we just chuck whatever ideas we have in our mind about a topic into the Zoom chat room), and even breakout room discussions. Regrettably, the interaction activities didn't work out well in Zoom, but he still managed to catch our attention (at least mine). <br />Overall, he is a very dedicated instructor. He has a slight German accent, but I think it's more charismatic than difficult to understand, so it's not a problem. Honoured to be one of his guinea pigs :)<br />By the way, the IA of the course organised everything super well. He is also open to any questions, so feel free to ask the IAs if you are less interested to ask the professors questions.",
            "comment_grading": "-- Midterm exam -- 40% --<br />50 mins for 20 conceptual questions and 3 sets (a total of 8 questions) of computational questions. Covers lecture 1 - 10. 1 sheet (2 pages) of A4 sized cheat sheet is allowed. Suggest getting yourself familiar with all of the equations taught and jot all of them down on your cheat sheet. Jot down some facts about different types of engines too. Revision of homework is essential.<br />-- Final exam -- 55% --<br />50 minutes for 35 conceptual questions, and another 50 minutes for 4 sets (a total of 12) computational questions.<br />Covers lecture 11 - 22. 2 sheets (4 pages in total) of A4 sized cheat sheets are allowed. Suggest you jot down all data that are present in lecture notes. Completion of homework and revision of IPRS questions are essential. A lot of the answers to the conceptual questions are what I thought to be some fun facts that will not be tested, that's why I performed worse in conceptual questions. Write down as many facts as you can in cheat sheets. For computational questions, be more familiar with changes of units and all equations. <br />-- IPRS quizzes -- 5% --<br />One question per lecture. 1 mark for a correct answer, 0.5 marks for an incorrect answer, 0 marks for no answer. Pay attention to class and be careful then you can probably answer them right. <br /><br />Detailed statistics of exam scores are attached below. <br />For me:<br />Midterm: 90/100 (+1.31 SD)<br />Final: 104/120 (+1.12 SD)<br />IPRS: 89% (sorry I didn't pay much attention in class)<br />Final grade: A <br />(I guess the mean is B, which, I think, is quite good)",

There are homework problems that we don't need to hand in, so I just did those when preparing for the exams. Very light workload overall.<br /><br />CAUTION: As you may have guessed from the score distribution, many students in this course are either in physics major or have a strong physics background. If you don't think you do, or if you only have had your first exposure to physics through PHYS1001 and want a good grade, think twice, thrice, and quarce before taking this course. If you still choose to register for this course, be prepared to be spending a lot of time and effort catching up, to have results on par with people who have more physics background.",

Some are more theoretical such as calculating the entropy, others are more application based such as some engines used in real life.<br /><br />Apart from going through lecture slides, the professor also prepared several experiments to conduct them during the lecture. The experiments are really fun and catch people's attention.<br /><br />Lastly there is a final report. If you put effort into it, you could learn a lot throughout the process. You could still spend less time on it, but I think ust students should really cherish the opportunity to learn knowledge not related to their major.

According to the TAs, the lectures regarding Thermodynamics are especially hard. My experience shows that the parts regarding Thermodynamics are really crammed (and given by Professor Sou's teaching, will probably be hard to understand)...<br /><br />Which is simply not the case if you've studied PHYS1112. So, the advice is to take PHYS1112 before you decide to spam some grade/CGA in taking this course. For those who've taken MECH2310 (Thermodynamics), the content difficulty on thermodynamics should be even comical.",
            "comment_teaching": "As others have already said, Professor Sou is the typical PPT reader when teaching course materials. He has some Hong Kong accent, but is generally acceptable. You can simply read the course notes and wait for the PRS polling if you are bored with his teaching though.<br /><br />Professor Sou sometimes also include his own research results/products in his lectures, and to be honest, it's really pathetic to make a potential researcher to teach in this kind of boring courses.<br /><br />The performance of TAs are unexpectedly good though. During the lessons, one of the TA made good effort in answering my questions, usually extended beyond the course materials.",

Sometimes typical DSE Physics MC tricks (like the fact that transformers don't work for DC current) can put down waves of students, and these are usually the hardest PRS questions throughout the course.<br /><br />This year both the midterm and final are full MC exams, with the final don't cover those covered in midterm. Apparently they want to eliminate some people in order to pull the curve for grading, so the MC questions in the final are made unchangeable after you submitted it (like PHYS1112), and they've added loads of trivial information into the final, a fact mentioned by some previous reviews. If you can adapt to this kind of quiz bowl-style questions, it would be a piece of cake. I think someone on MSSSUG said that the questions are merely English versions of junior secondary exam questions.<br /><br />Finally get a A- for the course. Some said that you can already expect a A- or A if you get 1SD above the mean in exams. My experience shows that the threshold may be even more lenient. After all, PHYS1003 is widely recognized as a grade spamming course.",

This part overlap with phys1112's lectures on heat and gases, so those who have already studied phys1112 or will be studying phys1112 is gonna have an edge. <br /><br />For final, it's something similar to dse physics and chemistry. Will learn a bit on nuclear power, batteries, electricity and generation, global warming, air pollution... (actually feels like a mix of dse physics, slightly chemistry and geography). The content itself is not hard at all, and there's not too much to learn in each ppt, so you will just have to be careful when answering the MC in exam to get better grade.",

            "comment_grading": "I will say the grading is not bad. But all of you considering this course really have to bare in mind that the midterm and final exam is OPEN BOOK, so everyone can easily flip through the powerpoint slides and find the answer (and that's also because the exams are in the format of MC, but answering the MC wrong will cause you deduction in marks). The mean of midterm and final is both high, and that's why even if you have high marks, it doesn't necessarily bring you to a very good grade. I am kind of slightly &gt;0.5sd above the mean for both midterm and final, and ended up with a B+.",
            "comment_workload": "There is no homework that has to be handed in. Your grade only depends on your midterm (45%)&nbsp;&nbsp;and final (55%) (and there is kind of 5% bonus for polling in class). It just mean there is nearly no workload until you have to revise for either the midterm or final. What you have to revise for midterm and final is the ppt, homework questions, pollings in class and stuff in the textbook (will be provided free of charge-- sth like an ebook, but anyway i have never even flipped through the 'textbook').",

You are also unable to view previous questions.<br /><br />There is not as much calculation involved as expected. Most of the multiple choices involve questions related to information in lecture notes, students that have weaker math ability do not need to worry much. Even if there is calculation, it mostly involves plugging variables into the correct formula instead of complex calculation.<br /><br />There is optional homework provided for every 2-3 lectures. These homework questions will occasionally appear in midterm/exam, so try to do them and understand how to solve the question before the exam.",

It would help you to get over the barrier of Thermodynamics and Engine efficiency.<br />(DO NOT take both courses together as this course teaches thermodynamics before midterm while PHYS1112 teaches it at the last few lectures before final!)",

However, this does not mean that it is good to shove all of them into the slides.<br /><br />Back onto the professor, I think his presentation of the ideas are good enough and acceptable, the only problem is the pronunciation. Two remarkable examples are Prof. Wang pronounced 'energy' as 'enage' and 'Air pollution' as 'L pollution'. Understandable, but imperfect.<br />(I have to stress that this course is about *Energy*. Therefore it is surprised for me that he made the pronunciation of these key terms wrong)",

Both exams allowed cheatsheets. My suggestion for the cheatsheets is that you should try your best to plug all slides into the cheatsheets, lol!",
            "comment_workload": "Nearly nothing, only self-practice, and the goddamn iPRS. Some of the questions in the self-practice are quite retarded because most students don't really get what the questions are asking ppl about, and lack of examples as well as resources result in a drawback to students' familiarity to the course's content. The iPRS are mostly easy questions that you would know the answer without attending the lectures, so some ppl suggest that you just need to enter the venue of the lecture in the last 10-20 mins just for the iPRS. Then you study on your own for the slides.",

Learning from the lectures or slideshows is almost impossible due to the extremely unorganized content and the inclusion of many irrelevant data. If you really wish to learn more about energy and related environmental issues, I suggest you pay Wikipedia a visit - that would be more worth-while.<br /><br />The scopes for the mid-term and final examinations are unimportant. The answers for the majority of the paper can be deduced from simple arithmetic or found on a well-made cheatsheet. Just copy everything you find useful (or bizarre), such as equations, oddly specific numerical values, graphs, onto your cheatsheet and you will be good to go.",
            "comment_teaching": "Atrocious. The lecturer is blatantly incompetent for the level of education he had attained. Mr. Wong speaks in an unbearably broken accent which makes parsing his sentences impossible. To give you an idea on how broken his spoken English is, he pronounced &quot;ship&quot; as &quot;shit&quot;.<br /><br />He also reads the slideshows word-by-word. Unfortunately, provided that the slideshows are messy and irrelevant, his text-to-speech would not help you understand the content any better. For instance, when giving a lecture on thermodynamics, he provided us a certain equation without explaining what any of the variables means.",

If you do not mind wasting your time on such a meaningless course, I would recommend this course to you for the sake of good grade.<br /><br />This course is also decent for securing you a satisfactory B or B+ if you manage to score around mean for this course, which should not be difficult since most of the exam questions require little to no brain effort.",

Various forms of energy and their use (including electricity, fossil energy, nuclear power, various forms of renewable energy), and their impacts on the environment both from a global and a regional perspectives will be discussed. Issues related to energy conservation and related environmental issues in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) will be discussed. Students without the physics prerequisite but have taken PHYS 1001 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.",

Hopefully that wide range was the only reason the course instructors struggle to answer student's question adequately during lectures.<br />The topics and questions examined in this course weren't exactly hard, but just randomly put together without much thought.<br />The HW and exam mostly consists of trivial arithmetic questions with technical terms stuck into it, challenging your understanding of the term &quot;Physics exam&quot;. There was also cartoon, low res graphs where precise numbers had to be derived for accurate calculations. Did I also mention the occasional exam question that involves physics topics never mentioned once in all lectures and homework? Did they even look at the exam paper once before printing it?",

Fortunately they scraped the majority of the course contents from the internet so you can find the source yourself and study from there.

Though that begs the question: Why am I paying tuition fees?",

Course does not contain any content that requires more than half a brain to process, so just cram useful lecture slides into your cheat sheet and you should score well in both exams. I have no idea how I got an A for this course, but I won't complain.",
            "comment_workload": "Homework was optional and not counted towards course grade. Though the HW does make good exam practice questions.<br />If you previously took the energy elective for HKDSE Physics, then most ideas presented in the course won't be new to you. <br />In other words you don't really have to do anything for this course, other than optionally show up for lecture PRS.",

Many contents are not taught deeply in the lessons.<br /><br />Back to the grading, I am very satisfied with my grade. I am below the mean like 0.5-1 SD for both mid-term and final exam, but I still got B- at last (I thought I would get C- or D!). Maybe it is because of the large number of students (400 or more?). So if you are at mean, you will get B or B+.<br /><br />If you are concerned about your exam marks, the course will set up the paper checking sessions after the exam so that you can know your actual marks and the wrong answers.

The course is basically &quot;inspired&quot; by a book written by an expert in energy and then taught as a common core course. To be frank, the course is neither interesting nor useful.<br /><br />The course covers stuff about the above topics listed in some detail, but not detail enough to make the things we learn applicable in a useful way. For example, they just mention the famous E = mc equation but do not teach anything on how to use and apply it. They even like to present a lot of data in the slides. How do we even study them? Take a look at the attachment and see for yourself.<br /><br />To your surprise, the things you learn during lectures aren't really the things that appear in the exams. For example, you learn about particulates in the air and their effects during lectures but they ask you to calculate the density of the particulates in the exam. This is as ridiculous as teaching stuff from one book and then asking questions from another.<br /><br />This course is also very unprofessional. There are way too many assumptions and they make the calculations meaningless. Also, the words the course use are not precise. Once, there was a question that asked: &quot;Which energy source is the most important?&quot;. Important in terms of what? How do you define important?

Of course, you could see what they were writing.<br /><br />I'm sorry for being that harsh and sarcastic but I have wasted my youth on this course.",

This is the reason why students attend the lecture.<br /><br />40% Mid-term exam<br />55% Final Exam<br /><br />There are 2 parts, MC questions and Data-based (long) questions. The grading system is ridiculous. You get 5 marks for answering an MC question correctly, but somehow for whatever reason, they deduct 1 mark if you get it wrong. Then each long question is worth 5/10 marks with no partial credit. Just unbelievable.<br /><br />But the grades are rather lenient. The mean is about a B and the difficulty is not high. It's more like a unit-conversion exam than a physics exam.",

The content tested are not too in-depth and you get to prepare a 2-sided A4 size cheat sheet to the exam. Not much memorization is needed. Understanding is rather important here.",

The midterm questions did not cover more than 50% of what was taught in the lectures (they only ask questions which are easier than lecture notes but you will never know because their lecture notes are long and incoherent.) They take attendance every flipping lecture, 2 per week and its 9am every lecture. Who the fuck even does that, I'm like 20 years old. Half the information taught wont be tested and its just useless to your education.",

If you currently have an interest in physics and want to learn more, do not take this course unless you have decided that you dont want to be associated with physics anymore. The professors are completely useless and they cover the most useless materials which will not be tested in the midterm. The only good thing about this course is that everything they talk about can be found in lecture notes but they bullshit so much in the lecture notes so there isnt really a point.",

But if you arrive during the last 20 minutes or if you have a friend that tells you the iPRS code it'll make it much better.

Not recommended to take if you are a business student or a first year engineering/physics student<br /><br />Having mastery over course topics (by means of mastering other courses taught by more capable instructors) is crucial to getting a good grade. In fact no effort is needed by this method. There will be plenty of folks (like me) who did not know this trick beforehand to lower the mean score. As an engineering student myself, just doing the required physics course (PHYS1112) will have covered most of the math intensive parts of this course. I had no idea what I was doing on the midterm exam on the thermodynamics question. However I learnt all I needed to know for that question in PHYS1112, which was sadly taught after the midterm. If only I took this course after I had done PHYS1112, I would have gotten a much better grade<br /><br />Peculiarities of the exams: 5 marks for correct and -1 for incorrect choice for MC part, no marks deducted for wrong answers in the written section.

Again, if you have mastered course topics from other courses, you do not have to put any effort into this course. You do not even have to go to the lectures.
