            "comment_teaching": "Professor Koc likes to do 2 things: <br />1. interact with students, and <br />2. leverage on his network, getting guest speakers to share the latest industry insights in the start-up scene.<br /><br />As an Adjunct Professor, he has extensive industry experience and currently works with a lot of start-ups, so that enhances the learning experience for those who are interested in the HK start-up scene.<br /><br />About your instructor:<br />https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-koc-aa48332/",
            "comment_grading": "Grading is very much based on how much you care and how much thought you put into each of his assignments. <br /><br />If you happen to disagree with Professor Koc's assignment grading results, it is recommended that you reach out to him in person and talk it out.<br /><br />Professor Koc values reasoning and logic a little more than his ego; he will give you his personal number so you can reach him more conveniently about things like this. There were many students that were able to successfully appeal for their assignment grades (not the final SIS one, once that's out it's too late), as they were willing to put in the time and effort to communicate their logic behind their work.<br /><br />So really, as long as you show up, speak up, work hard and be willing to learn, your efforts will be compensated.",
            "comment_workload": "The workload is reasonable as there's nothing much to prep for every class except for questions to ask about the topic.<br /><br />NO QUIZ, NO EXAM.<br /><br />You will write 2 essays and do a final group project designing a business development strategy for a real start-up. The majority of the workload is really discussing your deliverables and making sure you are incorporating your learnings and moving towards a viable direction with the professor.",
