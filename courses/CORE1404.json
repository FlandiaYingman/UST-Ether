        "description": "This course puts a strong emphasis on developing university-level academic literacy and communication competence in writing, speaking, and multimodal contexts. The course introduces students to research skills using university library resources for finding and evaluating sources for academic writing and speaking tasks. It expects students to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students‚Äô competence in communicating effectively in an academic community, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member of a group and assuming responsibility as a discussion facilitator in the context of student-led seminars. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

Let's say my class is entirely exceptional or downright terrible, it would be difficult to get 1~2 SD above the mean. Even so, if the class performance is holistically terrible, let's say all get DSE 5* + IELTS 7.0. If I was decently performant, it is rational to say that expected English class performance would be objectively worse than a class averaged at DSE 5** + IELTS 8.0/9.0. Yet the student in the former class would likely receive an A and the latter class be graded a B.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I got okay marks in DSE writing (20/21) &amp; IELTS (8.0/9.0).<br /><br /><br />With a sub-total of 85-90% in the CLE grading system, yet still got awarded a B+, whereas other classes had the lower 70s and received a solid A, which many of my classmates in other sessions would argue their work had an objectively lower quality. Both in terms of content + language use + organization and the design + layout + effort (Seminars &amp; E-Magazine).<br /><br /><br />The professor and our classmates personally appreciate the group of me and my group to a significant extent.<br /><br /><br />Yet the grading scheme from CLE is hilariously atrocious, nothing wrong with the professor, he's a nice and likeable teacher.",

This will be a major thing she's going to pay attention to. Every minute detail must have a source that backs it up. For your seminar, you must include it in your powerpoint slides.<br /><br />DSE grade: 5**<br />Average grade for assignments/projects: Competent/Advanced<br />Final grade: A<br />The result is good but I had to put in way too much work into the assignments and projects.

The major assignments are three annotated bibliographies (summary + review of an academic paper, one is ungraded), a five minute seminar, and an e-magazine (some basic designing + 1000 words, but you can mostly reuse content from your seminar)<br /><br />Bearable if you don't have a lot of projects for the semester, hell if you're a business student.<br /><br />Advice:<br />- Do some preliminary research into what sources are available to you before dedicating yourself to a topic. If you choose a very niche topic, you may end up using more time browsing for suitable sources rather than actually analysing them<br /><br />- This goes without saying, but pray to god that you have good group mates<br /><br />- Don't underestimate the self-reflection assignments",

Supposedly there are some materials for you to prepare for before each lesson and discussions in canvas you need to answer after each lesson, but they are not checked most of the time.

            "comment_content": "The content is mainly about citation techniques and learning how to use information from different sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;The course focuses on written and verbal communication skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The content itself is ok... but kinda boring and students feel aimless with the course.",
            "comment_teaching": "Gary is a nice instructor that gives relatively engaging lessons, he also encourages students to talk and share their opinions in class which I find quite good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes what is taught in class does not necessary help with our work though, but he sometimes checks in on how we are doing.",
            "comment_grading": "The grading of this course is strange<br />Gary is quite harsh in marking his students, usually only giving competent or advanced on the assessment criteria compared to other profs who give exceptional (full marks) quite often.<br /><br />I initially thought the course was curved among ALL professors so our class had really low expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end the grading done by Gary was not bad compared to other profs that I heard of. <br /><br />I scored mainly comp/adv and adv grade and ended up with an A so I'm pretty surprised",
            "comment_workload": "The workload of this course is horrible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its just work after work after work and it feels like its never ending.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no exams but the amount of coursework is painful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Annotated bibliography<br />Synthesis paper <br />Group seminar/presentation<br />Group E-magazine <br /><br />AND 3 reflections throughout the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A lot of the course work seems pointless as we are just repeating what we already did.",
