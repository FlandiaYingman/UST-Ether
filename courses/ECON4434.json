Class participation: 10%<br /><br />The grading appears to be rather laxed. Mean scores of homework assignments are well above 85. The scores for group project have not been released at the time of writing and the due date for the individual paper is on the 17th December 2021.",
            "comment_workload": "Slightly high but appropriate for a Level 4 ECON elective. There are no midterms and finals for this course. However, the timings of the group assignment and individual paper are not ideal. The professor released a written assignment in mid November. This was followed by the group project shortly. The group project took 2 weeks to complete and we have to complete an individual summary paper to conclude the course.<br /><br />All of this were released within a short span of 2 weeks and it made the workload a little unbearable. It would be better if the assignments and group projects were spaced out more. This allows us to complete the summary paper before the terms and it doesn't add on to the burden of revising for finals in other subjects.",

Everything is clear, concise, and relevant. <br /><br />Difficult topics are somehow magically made easier to understand. She remembers everyone’s names and little details about them. It’s a course where you can skip 10 lectures or be dead silent every lecture and she wouldn’t mind. As far as I know, attendance is not too strict as I skipped a bunch of classes. However, if you ask questions or make comments, she’ll remember you really well and you’ll feel like you’re getting a lot more from the course.",

Assignments can be done in one day if you’re caught up, and 2-3 days if you need to catch up.<br /><br />Great for balancing with other courses, good grades, little to no workload. Only a small, honest effort needed for B-range, and some minor devotion for A-range.",

Even though it was through zoom, she really made a good effort. Class participation was encouraged and you didn't feel bored sitting in class at all. The style of teaching was also not just limited to lectures/textbook, but analysing real journal papers from the past decade about topics in the field. This felt like a very fresh/relevant way to study the material and it really gave you a deep understanding of the topics, especially Microcredit. I feel like I walked away with some real skills, regarding empirical research methods and anaysing/reading journal papers. This is a must take class for econ/ecof/maec majors!",
            "comment_grading": "Class participation, 4 assignments and a group project. <br /><br />Pay attention in class, put in the effort, and you'll get a good grade, simple as that. Some people complained that she was a little strict but I didn't find that at all. Make sure to take the feedback she gives from the first round group presentation and apply it to your final presentation.",
            "comment_workload": "Quite a bit, but fair amount for a 4000 level class. There are no exams, only assignments and a group project, but these still require lots of time/effort, and even then, the mean would be around somewhere in the 75% range. The assignments would take a few days to complete, and the paper/journal analysis took much longer - about 1 week. The group project is also quite time consuming, but since the assignment is pretty straightforward (analyse a journal paper related to microcredit or savings), there is no worry for freeriding.",
